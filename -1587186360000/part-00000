They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.\n\nFantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people\u2019s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins ({{Lang|gaa|abebuu adekai}}) or in the [[Ga language]] {{Lang|gaa|okadi adekai}}.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Drawing by Ataa Oko, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|Figurative palanquin]]; drawing by [[Ataa Oko]] from Ghana]] \nAmong the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the [[Greater Accra Region]] around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture.<ref>The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 52-66.</ref> The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance'', in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73.</ref>\n\nThe invention of these figurative coffins used to be attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti<ref>Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: \u201e[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its \u201einvented\u201c inventor, Kane Kwei\u201c.</ref> and especially [[Regula Tschumi]] question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.<ref>The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.</ref>  [[Ataa Oko]] (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.\n\n== Making the coffins ==\nFigurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. \nA coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters\u2019 level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. \nThe painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish. Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.<ref>The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi.

Art Museum Bern, and \"Six Feet Under\" 2007/2008 in the Deutsches Hygienemuseum, Dresden.</ref>  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language.

The houses were designed by [[Richard Owens (architect)|Richard Owens]] and built by Welsh workers to house immigrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks.\n\n[[The Beatles]] drummer [[Ringo Starr]] was born in Madryn Street, before moving at age 4 and the house is now a tourist attraction. Although some houses were lost in [[Liverpool Blitz|World War II bombing]] and rebuilt, albeit in a different architectural style, many of the terraced properties in the original street configuration remain in the present day.\n\nFollowing a period of decline in the late 20th century, plans were announced in the early 2000s as part of the [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]] programme to demolish the estate and build new, but fewer, houses in their place. Despite the area being cleared of residents and houses prepared for demolition at a cost to [[Liverpool City Council]] of nearly \u00a322 million, funding was withdrawn in 2011 following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|change in government]] and the demolition did not take place.\n\nSubsequent revised demolition and renewal proposals by the council and housing group Plus Dane were rejected by the government due to concerns about the negative impact they would have on the city's cultural heritage. Instead, a housing renewal company took ownership of some of the properties, initially in a pilot scheme, to extensively renovate them and make them available for rent. The first new tenants moved into Voelas Street around September 2017. Place First, the company renovating the properties, won an award in November 2018 for the standard of the refurbishments.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Welsh Streets Liverpool OSM.png|thumb|160px|right|OpenStreetMap of the Welsh Streets region]]\nThe streets include Wynnstay Street, Voelas Street, [[Rhiwlas, Powys|Rhiwlas]] Street, [[Powys|Powis]] Street, Madryn Street, [[Kinmel Bay|Kinmel]] Street, Gwydir Street, [[Pengwern]] Street and Treborth Street.

The houses were designed by [[Richard Owens (architect)|Richard Owens]] and built by Welsh workers to house immigrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks.\n\n[[The Beatles]] drummer [[Ringo Starr]] was born in Madryn Street, before moving at age 4 and the house is now a tourist attraction. Although some houses were lost in [[Liverpool Blitz|World War II bombing]] and rebuilt, albeit in a different architectural style, many of the terraced properties in the original street configuration remain in the present day.\n\nFollowing a period of decline in the late 20th century, plans were announced in the early 2000s as part of the [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]] programme to demolish the estate and build new, but fewer, houses in their place. Despite the area being cleared of residents and houses prepared for demolition at a cost to [[Liverpool City Council]] of nearly \u00a322 million, funding was withdrawn in 2011 following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|change in government]] and the demolition did not take place.\n\nSubsequent revised demolition and renewal proposals by the council and housing group Plus Dane were rejected by the government due to concerns about the negative impact they would have on the city's cultural heritage. Instead, a housing renewal company took ownership of some of the properties, initially in a pilot scheme, to extensively renovate them and make them available for rent. The first new tenants moved into Voelas Street around September 2017. Place First, the company renovating the properties, won an award in November 2018 for the standard of the refurbishments.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Welsh Streets Liverpool OSM.png|thumb|160px|right|OpenStreetMap of the Welsh Streets region]]\nThe streets include Wynnstay Street, Voelas Street, [[Rhiwlas, Powys|Rhiwlas]] Street, [[Powys|Powis]] Street, Madryn Street, [[Kinmel Bay|Kinmel]] Street, Gwydir Street, [[Pengwern]] Street and Treborth Street.

A survey in 2003 found that 72% of respondents were at least satisfied with their home and over half were at least satisfied with the quality of housing in the area, whilst only 1% believed demolition would improve the area. The renewal programme's proposals were to demolish 500 Victorian terraced houses and replace with 370 new build houses, with a smaller scale refurbishment elsewhere.{{sfn|Chitty|2016|p=198}} When the plans were submitted, over half of the properties were under [[Housing association|social landlord]] control.

When residents were consulted over the clearance plans in 2005, a 58% majority favoured retaining the houses over demolition.{{sfn|Fox|2015|p=59}} In Madryn Street alone, residents voted 33-1 against plans to demolish the houses.{{sfn|Fox|2015|p=20}} The land was offered to private developer [[M J Gleeson|Gleeson Group plc]] and social landlord Plus Dane, with proposals published for lower density houses.

Homes acquired by the council were reduced in value by 20% each year to allow transfer to the council's preferred development partner for a nominal sum, whilst still being within the legal parameters for achieving fair market value. A three-storey townhouse in Kelvin Grove, acquired for \u00a3110,000 in 2011 had been reduced in value to just \u00a31100 by 2015.{{sfn|Fox|2015|p=20}} Following the formation of the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition government]] in 2010, schemes funded by the previous government were reviewed and ultimately funding for the pathfinder scheme was withdrawn with effect from 30 March 2011.

Plans submitted in 2013 suggested that 150 houses could be built and 40 refurbished, including those around the house where Ringo Starr was born. The cost was estimated to be in the region of \u00a315 million which would have seen the demolition of houses from the other surrounding Welsh Streets to be replaced with semi-detached properties. The managing director of the proposed regeneration, Claire Griffiths, suggested that 70% of residents had favoured the plans, yet housing charity Empty Homes disputed the credibility of the public opinion report, given the criteria used would have made it difficult to conclude refurbishment as a favourable option.<ref name=\"echo_plan15mil_feb13\">{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/15m-plans-liverpools-welsh-streets-3322999 |title=\u00a315m plans for Liverpool\u2019s Welsh Streets unveiled |work=Liverpool Echo |date=21 February 2013 |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> Anderson wrote a to Pickles in July 2013, confirming his support on the proposed redevelopment, suggesting the decision should be a local matter and believed the scale of the proposal was \"not of national importance\" and with \"no design or heritage issues arising\".<ref name=\"welshstreets_reps_doc1\"/>\n\nThe plans ultimately fell through when in January 2015 following a [[public inquiry]], Eric Pickles halted the demolition plans.

Although the streets had not been designated as a heritage asset, Pickles disputed that the streets were of low significance{{sfn|Pitt|2015|p=3}} and believed the proposals would be significantly harmful to cultural heritage and have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the nearby Princes Park, directly contradicting the view of an inspector.<ref name=\"planning_application_conclusion\">{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/395694/15-01-15_DL_IR_Welsh_Street_Liverpool_2206519.pdf |title=Application by Plus Dane Group at Princes Park, the Welsh Streets, Liverpool L8 |publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government |date=15 January 2015 |access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Refurbishment==\n[[File:Voelas Street 201709.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Voelas Street in September 2017, showing almost complete refurbishment]]\nWith few alternative options, refurbishment was deemed viable by the council.

Created by Japanese video game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], he is portrayed as a citizen of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants, constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) who provides assistance to [[Mario]] and his friends in most games, but there are times when Toad(s) takes center stage and appears as a [[protagonist]], as seen in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', and ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''.\n\nWhile Toad is the name of an individual, it also refers to an entire species (much like [[Yoshi]], [[Birdo]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] from the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series). However, in Japan, the species name is sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kinoko-zoku'''|[[:ja:\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf]]}}, literally \"Mushroom People\" (which is an alternate name used in earlier localizations, along with \"Mushroom Retainers\"). In other words, Toad (Kinopio) is a member of the Toads (Kinokos / Mushroom People). In the ''Mario'' franchise, there are also some other individual Toad characters (e.g., Toadette, Toadsworth and Toadbert). The most prominent trait of a Toad is its large head that resembles a mushroom in shape and color - historically speculated as them wearing a mushroom hat, but eventually ruled out by Japanese video game designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-05-nintendo-finally-confirms-the-truth-about-toads-head|title=Nintendo finally confirms the truth about Toad's head|last=Wales|first=Matt|date=2018-02-05 |website=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> Another common point of most Toads is their traditional vest.\n\nThe Toads usually play assisting roles in the ''Mario'' franchise and its action games, such as [[Toadsworth]] introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' and the ''Toad Brigade'' association in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. Despite this, Toads also play the role as heroes in some games. Such a case included the 2 Toads (yellow and blue) who were featured as playable characters along with Mario and [[Luigi]] in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. The 2 Toads (yellow and blue) return as playable characters later on in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' as well as ''[[New Super Luigi U]]''. Toad himself (in a blue palette in reference to his original sprite from ''Super Mario Bros. 2'') returns as one of the playable characters in ''Super Mario 3D World''. The Wii U title ''Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker'' cast Captain Toad into the spotlight, thus marking it as the first game in 20 years (since ''Wario's Woods'') to have a Toad as the main star, as well as the first title to have Toad as the titular character.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nToad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where the species was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Toad's design was made directly from the power up the [[Super Mushroom]], as well as the game's general association with [[mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 1: Page 4|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], reasons that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleasing to everybody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page8.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 2: Page 8|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser]]; however, some of [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]'s loyal servants, known as the \"Mushroom Retainers,\" were simply kidnapped. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbhq.com/smb.htm|title=Super Mario Bros.|publisher=Super Mario Bros.

Toad's Japanese name, \"Kinopio\", appears to be a mixture of the Japanese word for mushroom (\"kinoko\") and the Japanese name for the character, [[Pinocchio]] (\"Pinokio\"), which both roughly blend together to form the meaning of \"a real mushroom boy\" (as evidenced through Pinocchio's desire to become a real boy in his own tale).<ref>{{cite web |title=11 Origins of 11 Super Mario Characters' Names |url=http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |publisher=11points.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612201531/http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |archivedate=2012-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:ToadTV-NoCap.png|thumb|left|upright|Toad's appearances in the animated series sometimes depict him taking off his non-canon cap]]\n\nThough Toad has been seen wearing a mushroom hat on his head in the non-canon ''Mario'' cartoons, it has been confirmed by ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' producer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] that since the creation of the character in 1985 the mushroom cap was intended to be part of his head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNYfoFcrZY |title=Super Mario Odyssey Dev. Talk - ft. Mr. Koizumi|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nToad bears a similar appearance to the rest of his species with his large mushroom caps and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his vest in the recent ''Mario'' games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the ''Mario'' cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his non-canon mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.\n\nAt most times, Toad is portrayed as a rather cowardly character. Despite his fears, Toad is usually one of the few people who tries his best to support [[Mario]] when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the [[Princess Peach|princess]].\n\nHe has been mentioned to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad is helpful to [[Mario]] and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed as quite a shy character. In ''Luigi's Mansion'', he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about [[Mario]] getting kidnapped by ghosts, he was sent to the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because he was scared and feared that he could get captured too. In ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by [[King Boo]].\n\n===Abilities===\nThrough the various games that Toad is playable in, he has been shown with different unique abilities that differ from the other characters in the series. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the game describes him as being the strongest and fastest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a weak jumping ability, rated at 2 stars. In ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', Toad has the unique ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toad is once again given superhuman strength in the game, as he is able to lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not been seen since this game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Toad shares many of the moves and [[Mario#Abilities|abilities]] of Mario and Luigi, such as the ground pound and wall jumping as represented by the yellow and blue Toads.<ref>{{cite web |title= New Super Mario Bros.

(series)|Super Smash Bros. series]]'', Toad is shown to emit [[spore]]s like a real mushroom whenever he is attacked, as shown when Peach uses her standard special move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/peach.html|title=Princess Peach moveset Super Smash Bros.

Toad exhibits a similar technique in ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]'' where he is capable of using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill. He is also capable of using these emitted spores as a shield against various attacks in this game.<ref>{{cite web |title= Toad's profile (Mario Sports Mix at Nintendo) |url=http://mariosportsmix.nintendo.com/#/characters/details/toad|publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:ToadWario'sWoods.gif|thumb|Toad throwing an enemy from ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', the first game that starred him as the sole protagonist]]\n\nToad and his race of mushroom people made their debut appearance in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where they play a minimal role in the game. They appear at the end of every stage as the Mushroom Retainers (who serve the princess) once Mario or Luigi defeats [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], rewarding the heroes with the message: \"Thank you Mario!

In the American ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', Toad got his first individual appearance and was given a bigger role as one of the four playable characters. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Toad appears in the Toad houses where he provides items and extra lives for Mario to take on his journey. Toad, however, is the main protagonist of ''Wario's Woods'', where he is trying to prevent [[Wario]] from taking over the woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|title=Wario's Woods at Nintendo: Wii:Virtual Console:Games|publisher=Nintendo|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2010-01-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509071622/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|archivedate=2010-05-09}}</ref> Eventually with the help of [[Birdo]] and a fairy named Wanda, Toad fights Wario and in the end saves the woods from the clutches of the evil antagonist, restoring peace to the area.<ref name=\"Joystiqwario\">{{cite web|author=Wesley Fenlon |title=Born for Wii: Wario's Woods|publisher=Joystiq|date=2006-12-02| accessdate=2009-09-08|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/12/02/born-for-wii-warios-woods/}}</ref>\n\nThe 3D Mario games introduced Toad's role as a helper who would provide assistance to Mario if he needed it, thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him what he has to do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in ''Super Mario Sunshine'' as Peach's attendants. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the ''Toad Brigade'' led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks_vol2_page5.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy |publisher=www.us.wii.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw |title=Miiverse |publisher=www.miiverse.nintendo.net |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2012-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501195018/https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw# |archive-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with [[Toadette]] as the two look at the night sky.

Wii'' and '' U'', there are 2 playable Toads (multi-player only), one blue and one yellow recolor. The blue Toad has a similar appearance similar with the original Toad and even shares the same voices as Toad in ''New Super Mario Bros.

The Toad runs the fastest but jumps the lowest and falls faster. Captain Toad later starred in [[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker|his eponymous spin-off game]] a year after ''Super Mario 3D World'' was released.\n\nIn ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', Toad and four others (yellow, blue, green and purple) act as assistants to Professor E. Gadd, who had sent them to investigate the mansions before Luigi had arrived. Throughout the game, Luigi meets up with the Toads, who help him uncover secrets in the mansions.\n\nThroughout the ''Mario'' RPG series, Toad is featured as more of a minor character due to the large amounts of generic toads which appear in the games who seem to replace his role as a helper. Regardless, in the times he does appear, Toad is once again a minor character who just gives a backstory to Mario and the others. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', Toad appears as a major NPC character who teaches Mario about the different skills to use in battles in the beginning as the duo heads to the Mushroom Kingdom (though Toad had to be saved by Mario along the way as he is kidnapped frequently by enemies). Toad appears more throughout the game, for example as part of Mario's nightmare. Toad appears as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' for a short time when the player is exploring around Mario and Luigi's house. In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', Toad is kidnapped earlier in the game along with Mario and Luigi by the [[Hammer Bros.]]. However, Toad appears as a playable character in two of the minigames in the game. Toad appears in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' in 3 aspects of the game. He appears in the intro, telling Mario and Luigi that Princess Peach has been kidnapped, and later appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol. Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'', a mysterious [[infection]] called \"The Blorbs\" causes the Toads to inflate to many times their normal size and roll around uncontrollably.<ref name=\"dailyrpg\">{{cite web|author=Chris Buffa |title=Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Review (DS) |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907021312/http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |archivedate=September 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nToad has appeared in many of the various ''Mario'' spin-off games.

In ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'', Toad appears as a team member whose chemistry refers to his background; for example, he has good chemistry with Princess Peach and Toadette but bad chemistry with Wario. Toad also appears in the sequel, ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', again as a team member along with other differently colored toads. He also appears as a team member with good techniques in ''[[Mario Strikers]]'' and he also appears in its sequel ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' with the same role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/sites/mariostrikerscharged/|title= Mario Strikers Charged Official Website |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> His sidekick role is retained in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix]]'', where he accompanies either Mario or Luigi to help get back the musical keys from the villains of the game.

Mini Toads make a returning appearance the in 2010 release of ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!]]'' as playable characters who assist Mario on his journey to rescue his friend Pauline from the clutches of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].<ref>{{cite web |title= \"Mario vs. Donkey Kong:Mini-Land Mayhem!\" Official site|url=http://mariovsdk.nintendo.com/# |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> Toad makes appearances in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]''. A Mystery Mushroom costume based on Toad can be unlocked, and Toad appears at the end of the 10-Mario challenge and the easy mode of the 100-Mario challenge, saying that [[Princess Peach]] has been taken to another castle (kind of like what happened in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''). Another Mystery Mushroom costume based on Captain Toad from ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]'' was also made available through an update. In ''[[Super Mario Run]]'', Toad is one of six playable characters and it can be unlocked by connecting a [[My Nintendo]] account. In addition, he is the referee of Toad Rally if players use Toadette.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' he is a referee along with [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Cream the Rabbit|Cream the Rabbit]], a [[Lakitu]], and other Mario and Sonic characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/14007 |title=Wii Preview: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games |publisher=Nintendo World Report |author=Steven Rodriguez |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', Toad appears in the adventure mode and as well as a host. In ''[[Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games]]'', Toad resumes his role as one of the main hosts; however, he plays a much larger role as a main protagonist within the story mode in the 3DS version of the game.

Toad's role in the show was to be the sidekick to the Mario Bros. (as Luigi was a major character rather than a sidekick). He remained on the show when it spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', allowing them to live in his house. During the show he got alternate forms such as The Toad Warrior, Fire Toad and even Baby Toad; however, these forms of Toad have not made an appearance outside of the show. Due to his absence in the ''[[Super Mario World]]'' game, Toad did not make an appearance in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|the TV show of ''Super Mario World'']] with [[Yoshi]] and Oogtar (the latter having the same voice actor as Toad) instead taking his place. Toad appeared in the [[Nintendo Comics System|''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books]] published by [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] as well. In these comics, Toad often followed Mario on his adventures, seemingly replacing Luigi as the hero's sidekick. He was a regular companion for King Toadstool, and even indulged in the King's activities. Played by [[Mojo Nixon]], Toad appeared as a street musician in the non-canon [[Super Mario Bros.

Created by Japanese video game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], he is portrayed as a citizen of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants, constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) who provides assistance to [[Mario]] and his friends in most games, but there are times when Toad(s) takes center stage and appears as a [[protagonist]], as seen in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', and ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''.\n\nWhile Toad is the name of an individual, it also refers to an entire species (much like [[Yoshi]], [[Birdo]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] from the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series). However, in Japan, the species name is sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kinoko-zoku'''|[[:ja:\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf]]}}, literally \"Mushroom People\" (which is an alternate name used in earlier localizations, along with \"Mushroom Retainers\"). In other words, Toad (Kinopio) is a member of the Toads (Kinokos / Mushroom People). In the ''Mario'' franchise, there are also some other individual Toad characters (e.g., Toadette, Toadsworth and Toadbert). The most prominent trait of a Toad is its large head that resembles a mushroom in shape and color - historically speculated as them wearing a mushroom hat, but eventually ruled out by Japanese video game designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-05-nintendo-finally-confirms-the-truth-about-toads-head|title=Nintendo finally confirms the truth about Toad's head|last=Wales|first=Matt|date=2018-02-05 |website=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> Another common point of most Toads is their traditional vest.\n\nThe Toads usually play assisting roles in the ''Mario'' franchise and its action games, such as [[Toadsworth]] introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' and the ''Toad Brigade'' association in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. Despite this, Toads also play the role as heroes in some games. Such a case included the 2 Toads (yellow and blue) who were featured as playable characters along with Mario and [[Luigi]] in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. The 2 Toads (yellow and blue) return as playable characters later on in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' as well as ''[[New Super Luigi U]]''. Toad himself (in a blue palette in reference to his original sprite from ''Super Mario Bros. 2'') returns as one of the playable characters in ''Super Mario 3D World''. The Wii U title ''Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker'' cast Captain Toad into the spotlight, thus marking it as the first game in 20 years (since ''Wario's Woods'') to have a Toad as the main star, as well as the first title to have Toad as the titular character.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nToad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where the species was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Toad's design was made directly from the power up the [[Super Mushroom]], as well as the game's general association with [[mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 1: Page 4|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], reasons that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleasing to everybody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page8.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 2: Page 8|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser]]; however, some of [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]'s loyal servants, known as the \"Mushroom Retainers,\" were simply kidnapped. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbhq.com/smb.htm|title=Super Mario Bros.|publisher=Super Mario Bros.

Toad's Japanese name, \"Kinopio\", appears to be a mixture of the Japanese word for mushroom (\"kinoko\") and the Japanese name for the character, [[Pinocchio]] (\"Pinokio\"), which both roughly blend together to form the meaning of \"a real mushroom boy\" (as evidenced through Pinocchio's desire to become a real boy in his own tale).<ref>{{cite web |title=11 Origins of 11 Super Mario Characters' Names |url=http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |publisher=11points.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612201531/http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |archivedate=2012-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:ToadTV-NoCap.png|thumb|left|upright|Toad's appearances in the animated series sometimes depict him taking off his non-canon cap]]\n\nThough Toad has been seen wearing a mushroom hat on his head in the non-canon ''Mario'' cartoons, it has been confirmed by ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' producer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] that since the creation of the character in 1985 the mushroom cap was intended to be part of his head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNYfoFcrZY |title=Super Mario Odyssey Dev. Talk - ft. Mr. Koizumi|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nToad bears a similar appearance to the rest of his species with his large mushroom caps and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his vest in the recent ''Mario'' games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the ''Mario'' cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his non-canon mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.\n\nAt most times, Toad is portrayed as a rather cowardly character. Despite his fears, Toad is usually one of the few people who tries his best to support [[Mario]] when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the [[Princess Peach|princess]].\n\nHe has been mentioned to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad is helpful to [[Mario]] and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed as quite a shy character. In ''Luigi's Mansion'', he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about [[Mario]] getting kidnapped by ghosts, he was sent to the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because he was scared and feared that he could get captured too. In ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by [[King Boo]].\n\n===Abilities===\nThrough the various games that Toad is playable in, he has been shown with different unique abilities that differ from the other characters in the series. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the game describes him as being the strongest and fastest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a weak jumping ability, rated at 2 stars. In ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', Toad has the unique ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toad is once again given superhuman strength in the game, as he is able to lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not been seen since this game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Toad shares many of the moves and [[Mario#Abilities|abilities]] of Mario and Luigi, such as the ground pound and wall jumping as represented by the yellow and blue Toads.<ref>{{cite web |title= New Super Mario Bros.

(series)|Super Smash Bros. series]]'', Toad is shown to emit [[spore]]s like a real mushroom whenever he is attacked, as shown when Peach uses her standard special move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/peach.html|title=Princess Peach moveset Super Smash Bros.

Toad exhibits a similar technique in ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]'' where he is capable of using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill. He is also capable of using these emitted spores as a shield against various attacks in this game.<ref>{{cite web |title= Toad's profile (Mario Sports Mix at Nintendo) |url=http://mariosportsmix.nintendo.com/#/characters/details/toad|publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:ToadWario'sWoods.gif|thumb|Toad throwing an enemy from ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', the first game that starred him as the sole protagonist]]\n\nToad and his race of mushroom people made their debut appearance in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where they play a minimal role in the game.

In the American ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', Toad got his first individual appearance and was given a bigger role as one of the four playable characters. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Toad appears in the Toad houses where he provides items and extra lives for Mario to take on his journey.

In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him what he has to do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in ''Super Mario Sunshine'' as Peach's attendants. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the ''Toad Brigade'' led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks_vol2_page5.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy |publisher=www.us.wii.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw |title=Miiverse |publisher=www.miiverse.nintendo.net |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2012-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501195018/https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw# |archive-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with [[Toadette]] as the two look at the night sky.

The Toad runs the fastest but jumps the lowest and falls faster. Captain Toad later starred in [[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker|his eponymous spin-off game]] a year after ''Super Mario 3D World'' was released.\n\nIn ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', Toad and four others (yellow, blue, green and purple) act as assistants to Professor E. Gadd, who had sent them to investigate the mansions before Luigi had arrived. Throughout the game, Luigi meets up with the Toads, who help him uncover secrets in the mansions.\n\nThroughout the ''Mario'' RPG series, Toad is featured as more of a minor character due to the large amounts of generic toads which appear in the games who seem to replace his role as a helper. Regardless, in the times he does appear, Toad is once again a minor character who just gives a backstory to Mario and the others. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', Toad appears as a major NPC character who teaches Mario about the different skills to use in battles in the beginning as the duo heads to the Mushroom Kingdom (though Toad had to be saved by Mario along the way as he is kidnapped frequently by enemies). Toad appears more throughout the game, for example as part of Mario's nightmare. Toad appears as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' for a short time when the player is exploring around Mario and Luigi's house. In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', Toad is kidnapped earlier in the game along with Mario and Luigi by the [[Hammer Bros.]]. However, Toad appears as a playable character in two of the minigames in the game. Toad appears in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' in 3 aspects of the game. He appears in the intro, telling Mario and Luigi that Princess Peach has been kidnapped, and later appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol. Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'', a mysterious [[infection]] called \"The Blorbs\" causes the Toads to inflate to many times their normal size and roll around uncontrollably.<ref name=\"dailyrpg\">{{cite web|author=Chris Buffa |title=Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Review (DS) |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907021312/http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |archivedate=September 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nToad has appeared in many of the various ''Mario'' spin-off games.

In ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'', Toad appears as a team member whose chemistry refers to his background; for example, he has good chemistry with Princess Peach and Toadette but bad chemistry with Wario. Toad also appears in the sequel, ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', again as a team member along with other differently colored toads. He also appears as a team member with good techniques in ''[[Mario Strikers]]'' and he also appears in its sequel ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' with the same role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/sites/mariostrikerscharged/|title= Mario Strikers Charged Official Website |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> His sidekick role is retained in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix]]'', where he accompanies either Mario or Luigi to help get back the musical keys from the villains of the game. Mini Toads (toy versions of Toad) are included as playable characters throughout the ''Mario vs. Donkey Kong'' series, starting with ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]''. Mini Toads make a returning appearance the in 2010 release of ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!]]'' as playable characters who assist Mario on his journey to rescue his friend Pauline from the clutches of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].<ref>{{cite web |title= \"Mario vs. Donkey Kong:Mini-Land Mayhem!\" Official site|url=http://mariovsdk.nintendo.com/# |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> Toad makes appearances in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]''. A Mystery Mushroom costume based on Toad can be unlocked, and Toad appears at the end of the 10-Mario challenge and the easy mode of the 100-Mario challenge, saying that [[Princess Peach]] has been taken to another castle (kind of like what happened in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''). Another Mystery Mushroom costume based on Captain Toad from ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]'' was also made available through an update. In ''[[Super Mario Run]]'', Toad is one of six playable characters and it can be unlocked by connecting a [[My Nintendo]] account. In addition, he is the referee of Toad Rally if players use Toadette.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' he is a referee along with [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Cream the Rabbit|Cream the Rabbit]], a [[Lakitu]], and other Mario and Sonic characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/14007 |title=Wii Preview: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games |publisher=Nintendo World Report |author=Steven Rodriguez |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', Toad appears in the adventure mode and as well as a host. In ''[[Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games]]'', Toad resumes his role as one of the main hosts; however, he plays a much larger role as a main protagonist within the story mode in the 3DS version of the game.

Toad's role in the show was to be the sidekick to the Mario Bros. (as Luigi was a major character rather than a sidekick). He remained on the show when it spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', allowing them to live in his house. During the show he got alternate forms such as The Toad Warrior, Fire Toad and even Baby Toad; however, these forms of Toad have not made an appearance outside of the show. Due to his absence in the ''[[Super Mario World]]'' game, Toad did not make an appearance in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|the TV show of ''Super Mario World'']] with [[Yoshi]] and Oogtar (the latter having the same voice actor as Toad) instead taking his place. Toad appeared in the [[Nintendo Comics System|''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books]] published by [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] as well. In these comics, Toad often followed Mario on his adventures, seemingly replacing Luigi as the hero's sidekick. He was a regular companion for King Toadstool, and even indulged in the King's activities. Played by [[Mojo Nixon]], Toad appeared as a street musician in the non-canon [[Super Mario Bros.
