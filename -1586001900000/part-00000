The gallery became the home for Sydney's young [[expressionist]]s, such as [[John Olsen (Australian artist)|John Olsen]], [[Stanislav Rapotec|Stan Rapotec]], [[Robert Klippel]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]. The gallery later became the home of noted artist, [[Martin Sharp]] and was then known as ''Yellow House''.
