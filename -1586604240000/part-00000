{"title_page": "List of American novelists", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Main category|American novelists}}\nThis is a '''list of [[novelist]]s from the [[United States]]''', listed with titles of a major work for each.\n\nThis is not intended to be a list of every American (born U.S. citizen, naturalized citizen, or long-time resident alien) who has published a [[novel]]. (For the purposes of this article, ''novel'' is defined as an extended work of [[fiction]]. This definition is loosely interpreted to include novellas, novelettes, and books of interconnected short stories.) [[Novelist]]s on this list have achieved a notability that exceeds merely having been published. The writers on the current list fall into one or more of the following categories:\n\n# All American novelists who have articles in Wikipedia should be on this list, and even if they do not clearly meet any other criteria they should not be removed until the article itself is removed.\n# Winner of a major literary prize, even if the winning work was a story collection rather than a novel: The [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]], The PEN American Center Book Awards, the [[National Book Award#Fiction|National Book Award]], the [[American Book Award]], the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]], the [[Orange Prize for Fiction|Orange Prize]], and some others. (Note: The only Pulitzer winner for Fiction not on the list is [[James Alan McPherson]], who has never published a novel.)\n# Having a substantial body of work, widely respected and reviewed in major publications, and perhaps often nominated or a finalist for major awards.\n# A pioneering literary figure, possibly for the style or substance of their entire body of work, or for a single novel that was a notable \"first\" of some kind in U.S. literary history.\n# Had several massive bestsellers, or even just one huge seller that has entered the cultural lexicon ([[Grace Metalious]] and ''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'', for example).\n# A leading figure\u2014especially award-winning, and with crossover appeal to mainstream readers, reviewers, and scholars\u2014in a major genre or subcategory of fiction: [[Romance novel|Romance]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Western fiction|western]], [[Young adult literature|young adult fiction]], [[American literary regionalism|regional or \"local color\" fiction]], [[proletarian literature|proletarian fiction]], etc.\n\n{{dynamic_list}}\n{{compact ToC|center=yes|nobreak=yes|seealso=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n== A ==\n\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|center=yes|top=yes}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Patricia Aakhus]] (1952\u20132012), ''The Voyage of Mael Duin's Curragh''\n* [[Atia Abawi]]\n* [[Edward Abbey]] (1927\u20131989), ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]''\n* [[Lynn Abbey]] (born 1948), ''Daughter of the Bright Moon''\n* [[Belle Kendrick Abbott]] (1842\u20131893), ''Leah Mordecai''\n* [[Eleanor Hallowell Abbott]] (1872\u20131958), poet, novelist and short story writer\n* [[Hailey Abbott]], ''Summer Boys''\n* [[Megan Abbott]] (born 1971), ''Die A Little''\n* [[Shana Ab\u00e9]], ''A Rose in Winter''\n* [[Louise Abeita]] (born 1926), Native American Isleta [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] writer, ''I am a Pueblo Indian Girl''\n* [[Robert H.

It was an independent princely state  from 1443 to 1775 and a princely estate under the British rule from 1776 to 1947. It had three capitals under different rulers, Nandapur, [[Rayagada]] and the most prominent being [[Jeypore]]. {{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|}}\nThe kingdom of Jeypore (Kalinga) was the largest among all other princely states and estates in [[Madras Presidency]] covering an area of {{cvt|31,079|sqkm}} in the year 1880 and {{cvt|36,259|sqkm}} in 1925.{{sfn|Royal Collection Trust UK|1880|}} Surprisingly, despite being the largest kingdom they were never conferred upon the status of a princely state because they lost their crucial feudatories of [[Bobbili]], [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]], [[Salur]], [[Srungavarapukota]], [[Nayagarh|Nowagarh]], [[Khariar]] and [[Gajapathinagaram]], as they clinched independence from Jeypore and were later recognised as princely estates under the British Rule. The last ruler of the kingdom was King Vikram Dev IV as the estate was dissolved in 1947 and merged into the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=58}}\n     \n[[File:Jeypore Palace.jpg|thumb|Jeypore Palace]]\n\n==Early History==\n\nThe last king of Silavansa dynasty, Pratap Ganga Raj was succeeded by Vinayak Dev (1443-1476) a prince of the [[Solar Dynasty|Suryavansh]] dynasty of [[Kashmir]] married to the king's only daughter. He is known as the originator of the Suryavansh 'Sankara' dynasty who later went on to become one of the most dominant kingdoms of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] at some point in the history of the region but also had a gradual fall when they were succumbed by the rising power and alliance of their feudatories in the later era of some weak rulers.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}} Essentially, the advent of the British proved to be the turning point as they did not only cause a striking defeat to the kingdom but also destroyed the ages old stalwart bastion that was considered one of the prime reasons of their dominance.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}} The British Empire later recognized them as a zamindari which was the same status granted to their former feudatories. However, this did not disrupt the fact that Jeypore Maharajahs were the most prosperous in the region of Kalinga and according to one such account because of their militaristic dominance and alliances they acquired big sized diamonds imported from the famous [[Kollur mine|Kollur]] mines of [[Golconda]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=57}}These were the same mines that produced the famous [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond that now rests in the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|crown]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of [[England]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVinayak's reign, however saw a constant conflict with the weakening Ganga dynasty until the last [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] king Bhanu Deo IV was assassinated by his minister Kapliendra who usurped the throne and married his daughter to Vijaychandrakhya the only son of Vinayak and the first sovereign ruler, who expanded his domain to [[Reddipalli]] and [[Guntur]] after defeating the [[Reddy]] kings. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVijaychandrakhya (1476-1510) being a sovereign ruler amassed a formidable army to expand his kingdom to the coastal and rich agricultural land of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] and [[Visakhapatnam]]. However, his ambitions were humbled by the ruling [[Saluva dynasty|Saluva]] dynasty of Vijayanagar who stopped his advance to the kingdom and forced him to return after a month long venture of seizing the fort. Nevertheless, Vijayachandrakhya later went on to expand his kingdom in [[Odisha]]. He was succeeded by his son Bhairava Dev (1510-1527) in 1510 who ascended the throne in the era of the great Emperor [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishnadeva Raya]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Significantly, the army of Vijayanagara empire under [[Tuluva dynasty]] attacked the fort of [[Kondapalli Fort|Kondapalli]] which was heroically defended by Bhairava along with other Oriya chiefs.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}}\n\nVishwanath (1527-1571) famously known as 'Kalingadhipati' Maharajah Vishwanath Dev Gajapati, son of Bhairava succeeded his father in 1527. He served as a commander in the kingdom's army and successfully garnered a skilled set of soldiers. The fifth report on the affairs of the company describe him as the last prince to have united under his scepter all the ancient domains of the kings of Kalinga and restored them from the confines of [[Bengal]] to those of [[Telangana]] in south, which contained in his fold innumerable feudatories that paid homage to his royal seat.<ref name=\"The Fifth Annual Report\">{{cite book |last1=Presidency |first1=Madras |title=The Fifth Annual Report from the Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company |date=1866 |publisher=Graves, Cookson & Co. |location=United Scottish Press, London |page=141,217 |edition=First |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnb2a8&view=1up&seq=5 |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> He founded the city of [[Rayagada]] as the new capital of his kingdom and built a fort along the river [[Nagavali River|Nagavali]] and the famous temple of Maa [[Majhighariani Temple|Majhighariani]]. Furthermore, he conquered the southern parts of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and parts of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]. He successfully formed an imperial administration in and outside the radius of Kalinga and claimed the title of 'Gajapati' which was symbolically used by the powerful dynasty of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]] before its end in 1541. A peace treaty was signed between the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutub Shahis]] of Golconda marking river [[Godavari river|Godavari]] as the boundary between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=19}}\n\nThe kingdom went into a turmoil after the death of Vishwanath Gajapati as his successors failed endeavors of usurping the throne invited old adversaries like the Sultanate of Golconda who neglected the peace treaty and forced the next three kings in line to become their tributaries.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=30}} The era of Balarama, Yesovanta and Krishna Raj lasted for a combined period of 77 years consequently internal feuds and family rivalries weakened the kingdom to such extent that the next king in line, Veer Vikrama Dev (1637-1669) had to shift his kingdom from Nandapur to Jeypore.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=46}}{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} His rule lasted for 32 years and was majorly concerned in formulating the new capital and transforming it into an acropolis which can successfully withstand any unprecedented onslaught in the hostile region of Kalinga. One of his finest ventures was the royal education combined with the study of arts and rigorous military-combat skills that were given to his grandsons Vishwambhar, Krishna, Hari and Balarama and which gracefully served its purpose of making Jeypore a formidable kingdom. In the point of cultural significance, It was during Veer Vikrama's era that the [[Gupteswar Cave]] was discovered in the forests of Ramgiri and is an infamous Hindu shrine in the region. The next king in line was Krishna Dev who ascended the throne in 1669, he is known for granting [[Kumili]] and Gundredu in the modern taluq of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] to the family of Pushapati Sitarama Chandra Raj and the following zamindaris were created - [[Bobbili]], Devapalli, Rekapalli, Narava Mutha, Kottaki and [[Salur]].{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}}{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=50}}\n\nIn 1672, Viswambhar Dev (1672-1676) was crowned and although his reign lasted for merely three years, his great military achievements and administrative skills qualified him as a magnanimous ruler, the first to formulate a distinguished feudal system that included within it the significant feudatories of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]]. He created nineteen more zamindaris with Peddapalli, Ramabhadrapuram and Kalahandi being the significant ones.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} He also fought with the Dutch navigators and traders that attempted to confiscate land in the port of Visakhapatanam and was named as 'Sumber Deo' (a mispronounced form of his name). An odia inscription in a temple of Lakshmi-Narasimha revealed that  Maharajah Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673 and forced him by a treaty to pay revenue of two agriculturally rich villages of Gajapathinagaram to the temple of his deity.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=54}} His efforts contributed to the royal treasury as he was successful in importing diamonds from the mines of Golconda an enemy state he was lest afraid of during his short reign. Following his death, Malakimardhan Krishna inherited the throne of the paramount kingdom of Kalinga.\n\nMalakimardhan Krishna (1676-1681) famous for triumphing over the combined forces of Golconda sultanate and the [[French East India Company]] was a shrewd military genius. Evidently, the French-Golconda alliance planned a full-fledged attack on the kingdom of Jeypore following the death of the former king Viswambhar. However, the courageous new king lead his army to the combat zone which was a mountainous area in the middle of Jeypore and Rayagada. The adroitness in [[guerrilla warfare]] of the Jeypore army was well rehearsed in those areas and they were able to subdue the enemies. The General of the Golconda army, Malik-Muhammad was killed by King Malakimardhan in a duel battle of swords and as a result the name 'Malakimardhana' or 'the destroyer of Malik' was given to the warrior king. A total of fourteen French canons were captured by the army of Jeypore that added more prowess to the kingdom. The confederacy of [[Malkangiri]], previously known as 'Malakimardhangiri' was established by Malakimardhan Krishna along with a fort known as 'Malakimardhangarh'.  In 1681, he died without a male issue and the responsibility of the kingdom passed to his young brother Hari Dev.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=59}}\n\n==Later History==\n\n===Advent of British===\n\n[[File:L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Lady Viscount.jpg|thumb|L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Viscountess Goschen]]\n\nIn 1775, Vikram Dev I assembled a force in Rayagada valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the [[Northern Circars]] and he quoted, ''I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards.

However, the differences lessened when Vikram Dev II (1825-1860) succeeded his father Ramchandra Dev II (1779-1825) mainly because the company lost control aftermath the infamous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Revolt of 1857]] and all princely kingdoms of India went into the direct control of the British crown. However, the next king in line, Ramchandra Dev III (1860-1875) established a cordial affiliation with the British officials by voluntarily resigning the administration of civil and criminal justice in favour of the British government and also by aiding them in quelling the well known [[Rampa rebellion of 1879|Rampa rebellion]] in Godavari district.

The Hindu god [[Surya|Surya]] or Vivasvan is considered the primogenitor of the Suryavanshis. The dynasty remains a legacy of some great personalities like [[Harishchandra]] the wise king, [[Vishwamitra]] the king who gave away his kinship and later became a Brahmarishi, [[Rama]] the benevolent avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Bhagirath|Bhagiratha]] the king who brought river [[Ganges]] down to Earth; and also great kings and emperors like [[Ikshavaku]], [[Mandhatri]], [[Dilip]], [[Raghu]], [[Aja]], [[Dasharatha]] and [[Sagara]]. Due to the dynasty being millenniums old, there were many Suryavanshi princes that migrated to different parts of India and also the world. However, the original members of the solar dynasty can only come from the Aryan race excluding the likes of Rajputs or Jats who are the descendants of [[Scythian|Scythians]] tribes who migrated into India after the fall of the Gupta dynasty and hence cannot be considered as Aryans. The integration of these groups into Aryan society was accomplished by marriage with high-caste women or by conversion to acquire the benefits of the kshatriya status sanctified by the Brahmans. \n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width1 = 145\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  (II) Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.

Essentially, the family had been ruling as an independent kingdom and also as a vessel state during the rule of the [[Karkota Empire]]. Vinayak was disgruntled by the fact that he could never be a king went on a pilgrimage to the holy city of [[Kashi|Varanasi]] and secretly abandoned his old kingdom. According to the royal chronicles, he was an ardent devotee of [[Shiva]] and was hugely inspired by [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. Due to the complications he was facing in life he decided to relinquish his royal identity and life the rest of his life as an ascetic. During his stay in Kashi he resided in the temple of Lord Vishweshwar and one night he had a dream of god encouraging him to go to Kalinga desh where he will find his new kingdom. Consequently, he traveled to the densely forested mountainous region of Kalinga and stopped to rest in Nandapur a small feudatory of the Gajapatis ruled by the king of Silavansh dynasty. The king of Nandapur married his only daughter Lilavati to the suryavanshi prince and after ascending the throne he named his branch of dynasty as 'Shankar Vansh' or 'Sankara Dynasty'. Interestingly, Shankar is another name of Lord Shiva and naming his dynasty after him can be believed as an act of devotion to the god who guided the young agitated prince to his destiny.\n\n==Genealogy of kings==\n\nThe following people ruled the Kingdom of Jeypore:<ref name=\"Henige2004\">{{cite book|author=David P.

A peace treaty was signed between the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutub Shahis]] of Golconda marking river [[Godavari river|Godavari]] as the boundary between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=19}}\n\nThe kingdom went into a turmoil after the death of Vishwanath Gajapati as his successors failed endeavors of usurping the throne invited old adversaries like the Sultanate of Golconda who neglected the peace treaty and forced the next three kings in line to become their tributaries.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=30}} The era of Balarama, Yesovanta and Krishna Raj lasted for a combined period of 77 years consequently internal feuds and family rivalries weakened the kingdom to such extent that the next king in line, Veer Vikrama Dev (1637-1669) had to shift his kingdom from Nandapur to Jeypore.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=46}}{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} His rule lasted for 32 years and was majorly concerned in formulating the new capital and transforming it into an acropolis which can successfully withstand any unprecedented onslaught in the hostile region of Kalinga. One of his finest ventures was the royal education combined with the study of arts and rigorous military-combat skills that were given to his grandsons Vishwambhar, Krishna, Hari and Balarama and which gracefully served its purpose of making Jeypore a formidable kingdom. In the point of cultural significance, It was during Veer Vikrama's era that the [[Gupteswar Cave]] was discovered in the forests of Ramgiri and is an infamous Hindu shrine in the region. The next king in line was Krishna Dev who ascended the throne in 1669, he is known for granting [[Kumili]] and Gundredu in the modern taluq of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] to the family of Pushapati Sitarama Chandra Raj and the following zamindaris were created - [[Bobbili]], Devapalli, Rekapalli, Narava Mutha, Kottaki and [[Salur]].{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}}{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=50}}\n\nIn 1672, Viswambhar Dev (1672-1676) was crowned and although his reign lasted for merely three years, his great military achievements and administrative skills qualified him as a magnanimous ruler, the first to formulate a distinguished feudal system that included within it the significant feudatories of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]]. He created nineteen more zamindaris with Peddapalli, Ramabhadrapuram and Kalahandi being the significant ones.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} He also fought with the Dutch navigators and traders that attempted to confiscate land in the port of Visakhapatanam and was named as 'Sumber Deo' (a mispronounced form of his name). An odia inscription in a temple of Lakshmi-Narasimha revealed that  Maharajah Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673 and forced him by a treaty to pay revenue of two agriculturally rich villages of Gajapathinagaram to the temple of his deity.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=54}} His efforts contributed to the royal treasury as he was successful in importing diamonds from the mines of Golconda an enemy state he was lest afraid of during his short reign. Following his death, Malakimardhan Krishna inherited the throne of the paramount kingdom of Kalinga.\n\nMalakimardhan Krishna (1676-1681) famous for triumphing over the combined forces of Golconda sultanate and the [[French East India Company]] was a shrewd military genius. Evidently, the French-Golconda alliance planned a full-fledged attack on the kingdom of Jeypore following the death of the former king Viswambhar. However, the courageous new king lead his army to the combat zone which was a mountainous area in the middle of Jeypore and Rayagada. The adroitness in [[guerrilla warfare]] of the Jeypore army was well rehearsed in those areas and they were able to subdue the enemies. The General of the Golconda army, Malik-Muhammad was killed by King Malakimardhan in a duel battle of swords and as a result the name 'Malakimardhana' or 'the destroyer of Malik' was given to the warrior king. A total of fourteen French canons were captured by the army of Jeypore that added more prowess to the kingdom. The confederacy of [[Malkangiri]], previously known as 'Malakimardhangiri' was established by Malakimardhan Krishna along with a fort known as 'Malakimardhangarh'.  In 1681, he died without a male issue and the responsibility of the kingdom passed to his young brother Hari Dev.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=59}}\n\n==Later History==\n\n===Advent of British===\n\n[[File:L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Lady Viscount.jpg|thumb|L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Viscountess Goschen]]\n\nIn 1775, Vikram Dev I assembled a force in Rayagada valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the [[Northern Circars]] and he quoted, ''I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards. The wall 20 feet high, the bastions very good, the rampart tolerable and a ditch 20 feet wide and as much deep. I have ordered it to be destroyed.''

Nevertheless, Ajgar Singh who was the brother saw a crushing defeat and King Dariar was reinstalled in the throne who then granted two parganas to Vikram Dev for the military aid.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=99}} He also valiantly defended his territory and the capital city from the well-known army of the [[Maratha Empire]] in the region and drove out French from Malkangiri.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=72}}\n\nThe prosperity of the kingdom suffered due to the intruding and diabolical doctrines of the British East India company and there was a difference of opinion between the kings and the company just like all other kingdoms of India. However, the differences lessened when Vikram Dev II (1825-1860) succeeded his father Ramchandra Dev II (1779-1825) mainly because the company lost control aftermath the infamous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Revolt of 1857]] and all princely kingdoms of India went into the direct control of the British crown. However, the next king in line, Ramchandra Dev III (1860-1875) established a cordial affiliation with the British officials by voluntarily resigning the administration of civil and criminal justice in favour of the British government and also by aiding them in quelling the well known [[Rampa rebellion of 1879|Rampa rebellion]] in Godavari district. He received a medal of honor from King [[Edward VII]] who was then the Prince of Wales.

The Hindu god [[Surya|Surya]] or Vivasvan is considered the primogenitor of the Suryavanshis. The dynasty remains a legacy of some great personalities like [[Harishchandra]] the wise king, [[Vishwamitra]] the king who gave away his kinship and later became a Brahmarishi, [[Rama]] the benevolent avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Bhagirath|Bhagiratha]] the king who brought river [[Ganges]] down to Earth; and also great kings and emperors like [[Ikshavaku]], [[Mandhatri]], [[Dilip]], [[Raghu]], [[Aja]], [[Dasharatha]] and [[Sagara]]. Due to the dynasty being millenniums old, there were many Suryavanshi princes that migrated to different parts of India and also the world. However, the original members of the solar dynasty can only come from the Aryan race excluding the likes of Rajputs or Jats who are the descendants of Scythian tribes who migrated into India after the fall of the Gupta dynasty and hence cannot be considered as Aryans. The integration of these groups into Aryan society was accomplished by marriage with high-caste women or by conversion to acquire the benefits of the kshatriya status sanctified by the Brahmans. \n\nSuryavansh of Kalinga\nVinayak Dev, the first king in the house of Jeypore was the younger son of Raja Kumbhiraj of Kashmir. Their dynasty as described by Vinayak was Suryavansh of ancient arya race that practiced an orthodox Vedic lifestyle like worshiping Sun as he is considered a very crucial deity and also a forefather, other things include education in the four Vedas and following a strict moral code of conduct based on the principles of Dharma. Essentially, the family had been ruling as an independent kingdom and also as a vessel state during the rule of the [[Karakota dynasty|Karakota Dynasty]]. Vinayak was disgruntled by the fact that he could never be a king went on a pilgrimage to the holy city of Kashi and secretly abandoned his old kingdom. According to the royal chronicles, he was an ardent devotee of Shiva and was hugely inspired by Kashmir Shaivisim. Due to the complications he was facing in life he decided to relinquish his royal identity and life the rest of his life as an ascetic. During his stay in Kashi he resided in the temple of Lord Vishweshwar and one night he had a dream of god encouraging him to go to Kalinga desh where he will find his new kingdom. Consequently, he traveled to the densely forested mountainous region of Kalinga and stopped to rest in Nandapur a small feudatory ruled by the king of Silavansh dynasty. The king of Nandapur married his only daughter Lilavati to the suryavanshi prince and after ascending the throne he named his branch of dynasty as 'Shankar Vansh' or 'Sankara Dynasty'. Interestingly, Shankar is another name of Lord Shiva and naming his dynasty after him can be believed as an act of devotion to the god who guided the young agitated prince to his destiny.\n\n==Genealogy of kings==\n\nThe following people ruled the Kingdom of Jeypore:<ref name=\"Henige2004\">{{cite book|author=David P.

For example, men with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (47,XXY [[karyotype]]) have a single Barr body, whereas women with a 47, XXX karyotype have two Barr bodies. Barr bodies can be seen in the nucleus of [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]], at the rim of the nucleus in female somatic cells between divisions.\n\n==Mechanism==\nA genotypical [[human]] female has only one Barr body per [[somatic cell]], while a genotypical human male has none.\n\nMammalian [[X-chromosome inactivation]] is initiated from the X inactivation centre or ''Xic'', usually found near the [[centromere]].<ref name=\"Rougeulle\">Rougeulle, C., Avner, P. (2003), Controlling X-inactivation in mammals: what does the centre hold?. j.semcdb 14, 331-340. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.014 Abstract])</ref> The center contains twelve [[gene]]s, seven of which code for [[protein]]s, five for untranslated [[RNA]]s, of which only two are known to play an active role in the X inactivation process, ''[[Xist]]'' and ''[[Tsix]]''.<ref name=\"Rougeulle\" /> The centre also appears to be important in chromosome counting: ensuring that random inactivation only takes place when two or more X-chromosomes are present. The provision of an extra artificial ''Xic'' in early [[embryogenesis]] can induce inactivation of the single X found in male cells.<ref name=\"Rougeulle\" />\n\nThe roles of ''Xist'' and ''Tsix'' appear to be antagonistic. The loss of ''Tsix'' expression on the future inactive X chromosome results in an increase in levels of ''Xist'' around the ''Xic''. Meanwhile, on the future active X ''Tsix'' levels are maintained; thus the levels of ''Xist'' remain low.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Davidow | first2 = L.

In the 1950s and 1960s organizations such as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] were closely associated with youth politics, despite the broad social statements of documents including the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Port Huron Statement]] and the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Sharon Statement]] and leaders such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. Other late-period figures associated with youth politics include [[Tom Hayden]], [[Marian Wright Edelman]] and [[Bill Clinton]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{cquote|Our answer is the world's hope; it is to rely on youth. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement of danger. It demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. - ''[[Robert F. Kennedy]], South Africa, 6-6-1966''}}\n\n===Europe===\nYouth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. [[Free German Youth]] was founded in 1936 as a [[communist]] alternative to the [[Nazi Youth]] movement.\n\nIn the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the [[British Youth Council]], the [[UK Youth Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]]. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives. Many organisations that strive for youth movement are on the rise. A notable organisation is YouthDebates, an online organisation aiming to engage young people into the world of politics.\n\n===Globally===\nOther continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements.\nFrance:\nIn the recent Mexico\u2019s presidential election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called \u201c[[Yo Soy 132|Yo soy 132]]\u201d made a very notable change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections.\n\n==Present==\nBetween the influence of [[mainstream media]] and [[politicians]], youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized{{Fact|date=March 2008}}. Organizations such as [[National Youth Rights Association]] and [[The Freechild Project]] continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including [[Youth Service America]] and [[Advocates for Youth]] work for issues that affect youth directly. The [[children's rights movement]] is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, while other fledgling movements such as [[youth voice]] and [[youth participation]] have yet to gain the spotlight{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives.  Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important.<ref>Pryor, J.H., Hurtado, S., DeAngelo, L., Palucki Blake, L., & Tran, S. (2009).

The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement of danger. It demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. - ''[[Robert F. Kennedy]], South Africa, 6-6-1966''}}\n\n===Europe===\nYouth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. [[Free German Youth]] was founded in 1936 as a [[communist]] alternative to the [[Nazi Youth]] movement.\n\nIn the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the [[British Youth Council]], the [[UK Youth Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]]. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives. Many organisations that strive for youth movement are on the rise. A notable organisation is YouthDebates, an online organisation aiming to engage young people into the world of politics.\n\n===Globally===\nOther continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements.\nFrance:\nIn the recent Mexico\u2019s presidential election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called \u201c[[Yo Soy 132|Yo soy 132]]\u201d made a very notable change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections.\n\n==Present==\nBetween the influence of [[mainstream media]] and [[politicians]], youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized{{Fact|date=March 2008}}. Organizations such as [[National Youth Rights Association]] and [[The Freechild Project]] continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including [[Youth Service America]] and [[Advocates for Youth]] work for issues that affect youth directly. The [[children's rights movement]] is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, while other fledgling movements such as [[youth voice]] and [[youth participation]] have yet to gain the spotlight{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives.  Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important.<ref>Pryor, J.H., Hurtado, S., DeAngelo, L., Palucki Blake, L., & Tran, S. (2009).

Missouri|Stone]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. Most of the city is in Taney County, with a small portion in the west extending into Stone County. Branson is in the [[Ozarks|Ozark Mountains]]. The community was named after Reuben Branson, [[postmaster]] and operator of a [[general store]] in the area in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/v1/n2/W61b.htm |title=The Branson Story |accessdate=30 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213205544/http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/v1/n2/W61b.htm |archivedate=13 December 2010 }}</ref>  The population was 10,520 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].\n\nBranson has long been a popular destination for vacationers from Missouri and around the country. The collection of entertainment theaters along [[Missouri Route 76|76 Country Boulevard]] (and to a lesser extent along [[Missouri Route 248|Shepherd of the Hills Expressway]]), including [[Dolly Parton's Stampede]], has increased Branson's popularity as a tourist destination.\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, Reuben Branson opened a general store and post office in the area.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcxWsmxRzVEC&lpg=PP3&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Earngey, Bill | year=1995 | pages=26}}</ref> Branson was formally incorporated in 1912, and construction of the [[Powersite Dam]] nearby on the [[White River (Mississippi River)|White River]] which would form [[Lake Taneycomo]] was completed.\n\nIn 1894, William Henry Lynch bought [[Marvel Cave|Marble Cave]] (renamed \"Marvel Cave\") and began charging visitors to tour it. Hugo and Mary Herschend leased the cave for 99 years in 1950 and began hosting [[square dance]]s in it. The [[Herschend Family Entertainment|Herschend Family]] modernized the cave with electricity and concrete staircases, and in 1960 the Herschends opened [[Silver Dollar City]], a re-creation of a frontier town that featured five shops, a church, and a log cabin, with actors that played out the feud between [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|the Hatfields and the McCoys]].\n\n[[Harold Bell Wright]] published his novel about the Ozarks, ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (novel)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'', in 1907. The Old Mill Theater began its first outdoor production based on the novel in 1960. The show known as ''The Shepherd of the Hills Outdoor Drama & Homestead'' continues in its 58th season for 2017. It is also the home of Inspiration Tower, the Sons of the Pioneers show, and other attractions. The Harold Bell Wright Museum is located within The World's Largest Toy Museum complex. Mayor of Branson for 12 years and entrepreneur [[James Mason Owen|Jim Owen]] built the first theater in 1934 on Commercial Street, originally called \"The Hillbilly Theater\", which began to attract people from far and wide to tour the area. 1959 saw the completion of Table Rock Dam on the White River, which created [[Table Rock Lake]]. In 1959, the Baldknobbers Jamboree opened the first live music show in Branson.\n\nIn 1962, [[Paul Henning]], inspired by a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] camping trip to the Ozarks, created ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', which ran on first-run television until 1971. Henning later donated {{convert|1534|acre|km2}} for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson. He also donated the modified 1921 [[Oldsmobile]] truck used as the vehicle in the series to the [[College of the Ozarks]], where it is on display in the [[Ralph Foster Museum]].\n\nThe Presley family became the first to move their show (Presleys' Country Jubilee) to [[Missouri Route 76|Highway 76]] in 1967, followed a year later by the Baldknobbers. Eventually Branson would have more than 50 theaters, most of them located on Highway 76.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Chisai Child's Starlite Theater (not to be confused with the current theater by the same name) was one of the first to introduce stage sets, horn section, elaborate costume changes, and music outside of the traditional country music normally played. It helped to launch the careers of [[Shoji Tabuchi]] and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004614/Shoji-Tabuchi.html |title=Shoji Tabuchi Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Branson began its transformation into a major tourist attraction when the [[Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre]] opened and began to bring famous country music stars to Branson. Many of the performers who have had their own theaters in Branson first discovered Branson when they performed at this venue.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre at the Lodge of the Ozarks has been called the \"birthplace of Branson celebrity theatres\".\n\nAlso in 1983, the 7,500-seat Swiss Villa Amphitheatre opened in [[Lampe, Missouri|Lampe]], southwest of Branson. The outdoor amphitheatre brought in acts like [[Def Leppard]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Closing in the early 2000s, it reopened in 2010 as the Black Oak Mountain Amphitheatre.\n\nIn 1987, [[Boxcar Willie]] became the first internationally known entertainer to purchase a theater in Branson and have a permanent performance schedule there.\n\nIn 1989, [[Shoji Tabuchi]] opened his first theater in Branson (converting the Ozarks Auto Museum on West 76 Highway into a theater). He then built a new theater on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway in 1990, while [[Mel Tillis]] moved into Shoji's old theater. In 1990-1991 several nationally known stars such as [[Jim Stafford]], [[Ray Stevens]], [[Mickey Gilley]], and [[Moe Bandy]] opened their own theaters.  Along with these national stars, many home-grown shows also had theaters. The Lowe Family featured their show and hosted nationally known stars like [[Conway Twitty]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Vern Gosdin]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and others. 76 Music Hall (now known as the Grand Country Music Hall) became the first theater to have three different shows a day performing in different time slots. In 1991, local producer and entertainer Bob Nichols opened the first morning show and the following year, [[Buck Trent]] became the first nationally known star to star in a morning show.\n\nThe increasing number of theaters and other attractions opening in Branson drew the attention of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', which aired an episode about Branson on December 8, 1991, and called it the \"live music capital of the entire universe\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.explorebranson.com/about/branson-history#1990| title=History of the Branson Entertainment Phenomenon| accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Andy Williams]] built his theater in Branson, opening on May 1, 1992, calling it the Moon River Theatre. The [[Glen Campbell]] Goodtime Theatre opened in 1994, starring Glen along with his \"Goodtime Band\", daughter Debbie Campbell, the Matthew Dickens Dancers, and comedian ventriloquist [[Jim Barber (ventriloquist)|Jim Barber]]. Also headlining their own theaters were [[Tony Orlando]] (Yellow Ribbon Theater) and [[Bobby Vinton]] (Blue Velvet Theater). In 1998, the Acrobats of China arrived in Branson, making them one of the first international shows to call Branson home. They opened their theatre, the New Shanghai Theatre, in 2005. In 2006, [[Dick Clark]]'s American Bandstand Theatre opened and is the most recent new theater to be built on Route 76.

Between these two airports, service is offered to cities such as [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Denver]] which allows connections to other cities if necessary.\n\nThe airport in Branson, the [[Branson Airport]], opened in May 2009. This airport is privately owned, and is the largest privately owned commercial airport in the United States. Over the years, the airport has had on-off service from carriers such as [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]], [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]], and [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], but these carriers have either ceased operations or have pulled air service from the Branson Airport.\n \nBesides the numerous entertainment theaters for which Branson is known, other local attractions include [[Hollywood Wax Museum Branson]], [[Silver Dollar City]], [[White Water Branson|White Water]], [[Branson Top Ops]], [[Mount Pleasant Winery]], [[Dolly Parton's Stampede]], ziplines, cave tours, go-karts, mini golf, and more. Ripley's Odditorium is housed in a building that has been made to look as if it is cracked wide open by an earthquake or other disaster, while the [[Titanic Museum (Branson, Missouri)|Titanic Museum]] is a half-scale replica of the famous ship and iceberg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bransoninfo.org/#!branson-attractions/c1whk |title=List of Branson Attractions |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nBranson Landing opened in the summer of 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bransoninfo.org/#!the-landing-branson-mo/c1vwp |title=Branson Mall Info |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> on the [[Lake Taneycomo]] waterfront in downtown Branson.

Missouri|Stone]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. Most of the city is in Taney County, with a small portion in the west extending into Stone County. Branson is in the [[Ozarks|Ozark Mountains]]. The community was named after Reuben Branson, [[postmaster]] and operator of a [[general store]] in the area in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/v1/n2/W61b.htm |title=The Branson Story |accessdate=30 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213205544/http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/v1/n2/W61b.htm |archivedate=13 December 2010 }}</ref>  The population was 10,520 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].\n\nBranson has long been a popular destination for vacationers from Missouri and around the country. The collection of entertainment theaters along [[Missouri Route 76|76 Country Boulevard]] (and to a lesser extent along [[Missouri Route 248|Shepherd of the Hills Expressway]]), including [[Dolly Parton's Stampede]], has increased Branson's popularity as a tourist destination.\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, Reuben Branson opened a general store and post office in the area.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcxWsmxRzVEC&lpg=PP3&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Earngey, Bill | year=1995 | pages=26}}</ref> Branson was formally incorporated in 1912, and construction of the [[Powersite Dam]] nearby on the [[White River (Mississippi River)|White River]] which would form [[Lake Taneycomo]] was completed.\n\nIn 1894, William Henry Lynch bought [[Marvel Cave|Marble Cave]] (renamed \"Marvel Cave\") and began charging visitors to tour it. Hugo and Mary Herschend leased the cave for 99 years in 1950 and began hosting [[square dance]]s in it. The [[Herschend Family Entertainment|Herschend Family]] modernized the cave with electricity and concrete staircases, and in 1960 the Herschends opened [[Silver Dollar City]], a re-creation of a frontier town that featured five shops, a church, and a log cabin, with actors that played out the feud between [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|the Hatfields and the McCoys]].\n\n[[Harold Bell Wright]] published his novel about the Ozarks, ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'', in 1907. The Old Mill Theater began its first outdoor production based on the novel in 1960. The show known as ''The Shepherd of the Hills Outdoor Drama & Homestead'' continues in its 58th season for 2017. It is also the home of Inspiration Tower, the Sons of the Pioneers show, and other attractions. The Harold Bell Wright Museum is located within The World's Largest Toy Museum complex. Mayor of Branson for 12 years and entrepreneur [[James Mason Owen|Jim Owen]] built the first theater in 1934 on Commercial Street, originally called \"The Hillbilly Theater\", which began to attract people from far and wide to tour the area. 1959 saw the completion of Table Rock Dam on the White River, which created [[Table Rock Lake]]. In 1959, the Baldknobbers Jamboree opened the first live music show in Branson.\n\nIn 1962, [[Paul Henning]], inspired by a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] camping trip to the Ozarks, created ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', which ran on first-run television until 1971. Henning later donated {{convert|1534|acre|km2}} for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson. He also donated the modified 1921 [[Oldsmobile]] truck used as the vehicle in the series to the [[College of the Ozarks]], where it is on display in the [[Ralph Foster Museum]].\n\nThe Presley family became the first to move their show (Presleys' Country Jubilee) to [[Missouri Route 76|Highway 76]] in 1967, followed a year later by the Baldknobbers. Eventually Branson would have more than 50 theaters, most of them located on Highway 76.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Chisai Child's Starlite Theater (not to be confused with the current theater by the same name) was one of the first to introduce stage sets, horn section, elaborate costume changes, and music outside of the traditional country music normally played. It helped to launch the careers of [[Shoji Tabuchi]] and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004614/Shoji-Tabuchi.html |title=Shoji Tabuchi Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Branson began its transformation into a major tourist attraction when the [[Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre]] opened and began to bring famous country music stars to Branson. Many of the performers who have had their own theaters in Branson first discovered Branson when they performed at this venue.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre at the Lodge of the Ozarks has been called the \"birthplace of Branson celebrity theatres\".\n\nAlso in 1983, the 7,500-seat Swiss Villa Amphitheatre opened in [[Lampe, Missouri|Lampe]], southwest of Branson. The outdoor amphitheatre brought in acts like [[Def Leppard]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Closing in the early 2000s, it reopened in 2010 as the Black Oak Mountain Amphitheatre.\n\nIn 1987, [[Boxcar Willie]] became the first internationally known entertainer to purchase a theater in Branson and have a permanent performance schedule there.\n\nIn 1989, [[Shoji Tabuchi]] opened his first theater in Branson (converting the Ozarks Auto Museum on West 76 Highway into a theater). He then built a new theater on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway in 1990, while [[Mel Tillis]] moved into Shoji's old theater. In 1990-1991 several nationally known stars such as [[Jim Stafford]], [[Ray Stevens]], [[Mickey Gilley]], and [[Moe Bandy]] opened their own theaters.  Along with these national stars, many home-grown shows also had theaters. The Lowe Family featured their show and hosted nationally known stars like [[Conway Twitty]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Vern Gosdin]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and others. 76 Music Hall (now known as the Grand Country Music Hall) became the first theater to have three different shows a day performing in different time slots. In 1991, local producer and entertainer Bob Nichols opened the first morning show and the following year, [[Buck Trent]] became the first nationally known star to star in a morning show.\n\nThe increasing number of theaters and other attractions opening in Branson drew the attention of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', which aired an episode about Branson on December 8, 1991, and called it the \"live music capital of the entire universe\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.explorebranson.com/about/branson-history#1990| title=History of the Branson Entertainment Phenomenon| accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Andy Williams]] built his theater in Branson, opening on May 1, 1992, calling it the Moon River Theatre. The [[Glen Campbell]] Goodtime Theatre opened in 1994, starring Glen along with his \"Goodtime Band\", daughter Debbie Campbell, the Matthew Dickens Dancers, and comedian ventriloquist [[Jim Barber (ventriloquist)|Jim Barber]]. Also headlining their own theaters were [[Tony Orlando]] (Yellow Ribbon Theater) and [[Bobby Vinton]] (Blue Velvet Theater). In 1998, the Acrobats of China arrived in Branson, making them one of the first international shows to call Branson home. They opened their theatre, the New Shanghai Theatre, in 2005. In 2006, [[Dick Clark]]'s American Bandstand Theatre opened and is the most recent new theater to be built on Route 76. Branson has continued to add theaters (the most recent being the Sight & Sound Theatres) and shows; it refers to itself as \"the live music show capital of the world\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.explorebranson.com/about/branson-history#1980| title=History of the Branson Entertainment Phenomenon| accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 2012 tornado ===\n<!--This is a recent event, please make sure all statements are supported by references or they will be removed-->\nJust after 1 a.m. on February 29, 2012, the city of Branson sustained damage from an EF-2 tornado in the [[2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak]].

Between these two airports, service is offered to cities such as [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Denver]] which allows connections to other cities if necessary.\n\nThe airport in Branson, the [[Branson Airport]], opened in May 2009. This airport is privately owned, and is the largest privately owned commercial airport in the United States. Over the years, the airport has had on-off service from carriers such as [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]], [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]], and [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], but these carriers have either ceased operations or have pulled air service from the Branson Airport.\n \nBesides the numerous entertainment theaters for which Branson is known, other local attractions include [[Hollywood Wax Museum Branson]], [[Silver Dollar City]], [[White Water Branson|White Water]], [[Branson Top Ops]], [[Mount Pleasant Winery]], [[Dolly Parton's Stampede]], ziplines, cave tours, go-karts, mini golf, and more. Ripley's Odditorium is housed in a building that has been made to look as if it is cracked wide open by an earthquake or other disaster, while the [[Titanic Museum (Branson, Missouri)|Titanic Museum]] is a half-scale replica of the famous ship and iceberg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bransoninfo.org/#!branson-attractions/c1whk |title=List of Branson Attractions |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nBranson Landing opened in the summer of 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bransoninfo.org/#!the-landing-branson-mo/c1vwp |title=Branson Mall Info |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> on the [[Lake Taneycomo]] waterfront in downtown Branson. The lakefront project includes retail space with [[Bass Pro Shops]] and [[Belk]] as anchors in an outdoor shopping mall of stores and restaurants. It also features a scenic boardwalk along the lakefront with the Branson Landing Fountains at the heart of the property as well as a [[Hilton Hotel]]. Branson Landing has been known to host summer concerts and other special events throughout the year.
