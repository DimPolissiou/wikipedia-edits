He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

The large lead is OK given the content in the article and Wikipedia's MOS:INTRO policy.-->\n\nBorn and raised in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York, Schultz graduated from [[Northern Michigan University]] in 1975. After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three business books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]] and moderate political views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join the last contest because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, marriage equality, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three business books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]] and moderate political views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join the last contest because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, marriage equality, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.
