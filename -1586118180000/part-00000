Standing water is apparently not required.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Identifying the Western Skink.png|thumb|380x380px|Western skinks can be distinguished from similar species by a broad brown or black band originating on the side of head and extending past the hind legs (Left). They also possess seven supralabial scales (Right).]]\nAdult Western skinks have a broad brown stripe down their backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a conspicuous whitish to beige [[dorsolateral]] stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail.   A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating on the side of head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown.  Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood.  In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail.  They usually have seven [[labial scale|supralabial]] scales and four enlarged nuchals.  Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Geographic range==\nWestern skinks can be found from southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, to the tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and throughout most of Great Basin to extreme Northern [[Arizona]]; central [[Utah]] to the Pacific Coast.  The species is apparently absent from the floor of [[San Joaquin Valley]] (they have been observed in rural areas of southeast Lodi, CA), central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] (except a few scattered locations in the foothills where they are very common), and lowland deserts of [[California]].  In Northern Baja, California the species occurs in the northwestern part at least as far south as Colonia Guerro and in the south in the cape and Comondu regions, Santa Agueda, and San Francisco de la Sierra.  On [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina]], Los Coronados, and [[Todos Santos Island]] off the coast of California.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Defensive behavior==\nYoung western skinks have a bright blue tail with color that fades with age.  Skinks can perform [[autotomy]]; if seized by a predator its tail is deliberately cast and wriggles violently attracting attention while the lizard may escape.<ref name=Steb2003/>  The tail will grow back with time but is often darker in color and misshapen.  It will play dead, but this behavior is rarely seen. [[File:Juvenile Western Skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus).JPG|thumb|Juvenile western skink|288x288px]]\n\n==Life history==\nThis skink is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] during the period of warm-season activity. During summer most activity is concentrated in the morning and late afternoon.  Where summer temperatures are not extreme, activity extends throughout the day. Adult skinks usually become inactive by early fall but juveniles extend their period of activity several weeks.\n\nThe reproductive season for this species varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions.  Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2\u20136 eggs during June and July.  Western skink females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters deep in loose moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops.<ref name=WTan1957/>\n\nYoung western skinks probably hatch in late summer, and sexual maturity may occur at 2 years of age, but most individuals probably do not reproduce until they are 3 years old. Western skinks can reach an age of up to 10 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Spencer Fullerton Baird|Baird SF]], [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard|Girard CF]] (1852). \"Characteristics of some New Reptiles in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution\".

Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided. The western skink seems to prefer a somewhat moist environment, although it can also be found on dry hillsides.  Frequents [[grassland]], broken [[chaparral]], pinon-juniper and juniper-sage woodland, and open pine-oak and pine forests.<ref name=Steb2003>Stebbins RC (2003).

Standing water is apparently not required.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Identifying the Western Skink.png|thumb|380x380px|Western skinks can be distinguished from similar species by a broad brown or black band originating on the side of head and extending past the hind legs (Left). They also possess seven supralabial scales (Right).]]\nAdult Western skinks have a broad brown stripe down their backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a conspicuous whitish to beige [[dorsolateral]] stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail.   A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating on the side of head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown.  Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood.  In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail.  They usually have seven [[labial scale|supralabial]] scales and four enlarged nuchals.  Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Geographic range==\nWestern skinks can be found from southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, to the tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and throughout most of Great Basin to extreme Northern [[Arizona]]; central [[Utah]] to the Pacific Coast.  The species is apparently absent from the floor of [[San Joaquin Valley]] (they have been observed in rural areas of southeast Lodi, CA), central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] (except a few scattered locations in the foothills where they are very common), and lowland deserts of [[California]].  In Northern Baja, California the species occurs in the northwestern part at least as far south as Colonia Guerro and in the south in the cape and Comondu regions, Santa Agueda, and San Francisco de la Sierra.  On [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina]], Los Coronados, and [[Todos Santos Island]] off the coast of California.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Defensive behavior==\nYoung western skinks have a bright blue tail with color that fades with age.  Skinks can perform [[autotomy]]; if seized by a predator its tail is deliberately cast and wriggles violently attracting attention while the lizard may escape.<ref name=Steb2003/>  The tail will grow back with time but is often darker in color and misshapen.  It will play dead, but this behavior is rarely seen. [[File:Juvenile Western Skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus).JPG|thumb|Juvenile western skink|288x288px]]\n\n==Life history==\nThis skink is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] during the period of warm-season activity. During summer most activity is concentrated in the morning and late afternoon.  Where summer temperatures are not extreme, activity extends throughout the day. Adult skinks usually become inactive by early fall but juveniles extend their period of activity several weeks.\n\nThe reproductive season for this species varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions.  Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2\u20136 eggs during June and July.  Western skink females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters deep in loose moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops.<ref name=WTan1957/>\n\nYoung western skinks probably hatch in late summer, and sexual maturity may occur at 2 years of age, but most individuals probably do not reproduce until they are 3 years old. Western skinks can reach an age of up to 10 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Spencer Fullerton Baird|Baird SF]], [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard|Girard CF]] (1852). \"Characteristics of some New Reptiles in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution\".

It includes two high schools, one middle school, and two elementary schools as well as several specialized and unconventional schools. It is governed by a five-member elected board.\n\nCoronado is a resort city located near San Diego, California, population 24,697. Coronado, usually referred to as an island, actually lies on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a 10-mile isthmus called the Silver Strand.\n\nThe Coronado Unified School District boundaries are coterminous with the City of Coronado. There are approximately 4500 students of K-12 age living in Coronado; 3100 currently attend the Coronado public schools. There are several preschools, some home schools, and two private Christian schools.\n\nCoronado Unified School District includes Coronado High School, Coronado Middle School, Silver Strand Elementary, and Village Elementary. Coronado School of the Arts, a nationally recognized public school-within-a-school (conservatory) resides on the high school campus. Crown Preschool, a fee-based school, operates as an inclusion model for some of our special needs children.  The BBMAC pool complex is a for-profit facility that rents aquatic services to swimmers and water polo teams from around the world.  Our District ranks highest among San Diego County unified districts for state API and graduation rates.\n\nThe district enjoys a strong and stable management team and a supportive Governing Board. The District delivers a variety of exemplary programs to meet the educational needs of all students. District schools and individual students are regularly recognized for local, state, and national academic and extracurricular honors. The District employs strong partnerships with local governments, businesses, and foundations.\n\nThe Governing Board has developed a vision for a new way of learning in Coronado schools. Instruction for the 21st century learner must change in order to deliver a curriculum that utilizes digital tools effectively. Using a combination of broadband Internet and personal computing devices, instructors will be assisting students with sorting and evaluating the overwhelming volume of information available by engaging their skills of creativity, innovation, critical thinking, and collaboration.\n\nCoronado schools are powering up the classrooms and the students over the next five years with a combination of programs and services that include cloud computing, data warehousing, business intelligence solutions, STEAM, one computer for each student in all schools, and online instruction for a variety of courses using a variety of methods including the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) as a supplement or main content.\n\n==Schools==\n*[[Coronado High School (Coronado, California)|Coronado High School]], 9-12\n*[[Coronado School of the Arts]] (CoSA), 9-12\n*Palm Academy-Alternative High School\n*Coronado Middle School, 6-8\n*Silver Strand Elementary School, K-5\n*Coronado Village Elementary School, K-5\n*Crown Preschool\n*Coronado Adult Education and ROP\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|California|Schools}}\n* [http://coronadousd.net/]\n\n[[Category:Coronado, California]]\n[[Category:School districts in San Diego County, California]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Coronado School|the building in Albuquerque, New Mexico|Coronado School (Albuquerque, New Mexico)}}\n\n{{Infobox school district \n|name                = Coronado Unified School District \n|logo                = \n|motto               = \n|budget              = \n|established         = \n|region              = \n|grades              = preschool through 12 \n|superintendent      =  Karl Mueller<ref>http://patch.com/california/encinitas/mueller-leaving-canyon-crest-academy-superintendent-job-0</ref><ref>http://coronadousd.net/news/karl-mueller-named-new-cusd-superintendent/</ref><ref>http://www.delmartimes.net/sddmt-karl-mueller-canyon-crest-2016may02-story.html</ref>  \n| us_nces_district_id = \n|schools             = \n|students            = 3037 \n|teachers            = 178 \n|staff               = 146 \n|ratio               = \n|conference          = \n|accreditation       = \n|free_label          = \n|free_text           = \n|location            = 201 Sixth Street<br />[[Coronado, California]] 92118 \n|country             = USA \n|website             = {{URL|http://coronadousd.net/}} \n}}\n\n'''Coronado Unified School District''' is the public school district for the city of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[California]].

{"title_page": "Renvoi", "text_new": "{{Conflict of laws}}\n\nIn [[Private International Law|conflict of laws]], '''renvoi''' (from the [[French language|French]], meaning \"send back\" or \"to return unopened\") is a subset of the [[choice of law]] rules and it may be applied whenever a forum [[court]] is directed to consider the law of another [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]].\nPana\n\n==The procedure for conflict cases==\n#The court must first decide whether it has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (which will involve addressing the question of whether the [[plaintiff]] is attempting to manipulate the judicial system by [[forum shopping]]).\n#[[Characterisation (conflict)|Characterisation]]. The court must analyse the case as pleaded and allocate each component to its appropriate legal classification, each of which will have one or more [[choice of law]] rules attached to it.\n#The court will then apply the choice of law rules. In a limited number of cases, usually involving [[Family Law]] issues, an [[incidental question]] may arise which will complicate this process.\n\n==Discussion==\nTo limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law be applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.\n\nBut if that second country actually has choice of law rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a ''Single Renvoi'' system. A single renvoi forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, [[equality of outcome]] is always achieved so long as the competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. ''Forgo's Case'' (1882) and ''Souli\u00e9's Case'' (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the ''Introductory Law of the German Civil Code'' (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no renvoi system or single renvoi systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem.\n\nHence, there is another system called ''Double Renvoi'' or the ''Foreign Courts Doctrine'' which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other relevant law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single renvoi system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach.\n\n==Application of renvoi==\nBecause the doctrine is considered difficult and its results are sometimes unpredictable, its application has generally been limited to:\n*the validity of wills and intestate succession (the validity of transfers of real property); and\n*retrospective legitimation by the [[marriage]] of the natural parents (validity of divorce decrees).\n\nHowever, there are indications in some states that it might also apply to two issues in [[family law]], namely the capacity to marry and the formal validity of marriage.\n\n===EU===\nIn the [[European Union]], application of renvoi is expressly excluded in contract cases under article 20 of the [[Rome I Regulation]] (regulation (EC) 593/2008l formerly in Article 15 EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, Rome 1980). It has also been rejected for contracts by most Commonwealth countries.<ref>see ''Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v. Kuwait Insurance Co'' [1984] 1 A.C. 50 (H.L.)</ref>\n\nMost states also exclude it in tort cases e.g. in the UK section 9(5) of the [[Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995]]. Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the [[Rome II Regulation]]) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides:'' \"The application of the law of any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law.\"'' hence excluding the possibility of renvoi throughout the EU in tort cases.\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the doctrine of renvoi was revived by the decision of the High Court in ''Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd'' [2005] HCA 54 (29 September 2005).  In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China.  Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred.  Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or ''[[lex loci delicti]]'' governs [[tort]] situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: ''Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang'').  This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China.  However under [[Chinese law]], the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the [[Statute of limitations|limitations period]] (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China).  However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law.  Article 146 provided that:\n\n\"With regard to compensation for damages resulting from an infringement of rights, the law of the place in which the infringement occurred shall be applied. If both parties are nationals of the same country or domiciled in the same country, the law of their own country or of their place of domicile may also be applied\"\n\nAs a consequence, the Supreme Court trial judge concluded that Art 146 \"gives me a right to choose to apply the law of [[Australia]] because both parties are nationals of Australia.\"  This decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.\n\nOn appeal to the High Court, Neilson succeeded.  In six separate judgments, the majority of the High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong.  Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer [[statute]] barred.\n\nThis decision has received strident criticism by Martin Davies,<ref>''Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Limited'':  Renvoi and Presumptions about Foreign Law (2006) 30(1) ''[[Melbourne University]] Law Review'' 244</ref> and both the High Court and Full Court decisions have received very close attention by leading contemporary conflicts scholars including Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll,<ref>''Ignored No More'':  Renvoi and International Torts Litigated in Australia (2005) 1(1) ''Journal of Private International Law'' 35</ref> Elizabeth Crawford,<ref>The Uses of Putativity and Negativity in the conflict of laws (2005) 54 ''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'' 829</ref> and Mary Keyes.<ref>''The Doctrine of Renvoi in International Torts: Mercantile Mutual Insurance v Neilson (2005) 13 ''Torts Law Journal'' 1</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the \"forum most interested\" analysis. However, since ''John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson'' (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the ''lex loci delicti''.\n\n===US===\nIn the [[United States]] most courts try to solve conflict of laws questions without invoking renvoi.  ''In Re Schneider's Estate'', 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where renvoi is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court.  This is most likely to happen in cases involving immovable property or domestic relationships.\n\n==The main difficulties==\nThere are three main difficulties in cases where renvoi may be an issue:\n#It gives undue weight to the evidence of the experts on foreign laws.\n#The reference to the conflicts system used in other laws may reveal differences that would have arisen in [[characterisation]] or in the [[choice of law]] rules to be applied. If these differences would lead to onward transmissions, the forum court will follow the references into third (or further) legal systems. This is unpopular because it requires the parties and the court to consider evidence of multiple legal systems.\n#There may be an \"inextricable circle\" between sets of laws using either single or double renvoi systems which do not have adequate safeguards built in to guarantee when to stop accepting remissions.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Roosevelt|first1=Kermit, III|authorlink1=Kermit Roosevelt III|title=Resolving Renvoi: The Bewitchment of Our Intelligence by Means of Language|journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=May 1, 2005|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1821\u20131891|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol80/iss5/4/|publisher=Notre Dame Law School|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|issn=0745-3515|oclc=209129333}} {{Open access}}\n\n[[Category:Conflict of laws]]\n", "text_old": "{{Conflict of laws}}\n\nIn [[Private International Law|conflict of laws]], '''renvoi''' (from the [[French language|French]], meaning \"send back\" or \"to return unopened\") is a subset of the [[choice of law]] rules and it may be applied whenever a forum [[court]] is directed to consider the law of another [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]].\n\n==The procedure for conflict cases==\n#The court must first decide whether it has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (which will involve addressing the question of whether the [[plaintiff]] is attempting to manipulate the judicial system by [[forum shopping]]).\n#[[Characterisation (conflict)|Characterisation]].

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48,

Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace

expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret

\"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>Wen-hsin

The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].

In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau.
