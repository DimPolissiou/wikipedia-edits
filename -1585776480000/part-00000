Developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]], the show premiered on August 9, 2014, on [[Starz]]. It stars [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Randall]], a married former [[World War II]] nurse who in 1946 finds herself transported back to [[Scotland]] in 1743. There she encounters the dashing [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] warrior [[Jamie Fraser (character)|Jamie Fraser]] ([[Sam Heughan]]) and becomes embroiled in the [[Jacobite risings]]. The first season of the television series is based on the first novel in the series, ''[[Outlander (novel)|Outlander]]'' (also known as ''Cross Stitch'').\n\nThe second season of 13 episodes, based on ''[[Dragonfly in Amber]]'', premiered on April 9, 2016. On June 1, Starz renewed the series for a third and fourth season, which adapt the third and fourth ''Outlander'' novels, ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Drums of Autumn]],'' respectively.

She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love. The Clan suspect her of being a spy, and retain her as a healer, preventing her from attempting to return to her own time. Knowing that the Jacobite cause is doomed to fail, Claire tries to warn them against pursuing a rebellion. Her husband Jamie is captured, tortured, and raped by the sadistic Randall, but Claire and his clansmen rescue him. Claire tells Jamie that she is pregnant and they leave to sail to France.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\nIn Paris, Claire and Jamie try to thwart the Jacobites by subverting the funds that King [[Louis XV of France]] is likely to provide. Jamie becomes the confidante of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Stuart]], but the Frasers fail to prevent the risings. Randall reappears in Paris, but Claire makes Jamie swear to keep him alive until Frank's descent is assured. She achieves this by convincing Randall to marry Mary Hawkins. Claire loses her baby, and she and Jamie return to Scotland. The Jacobites win the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].\n\nBefore the [[Battle of Culloden]], Jamie convinces Claire, pregnant again, to return to the 20th century. Jamie decides to die fighting at Culloden with his clan. Back in her own century, Claire tells Frank about her time travel. He asks her to forget Jamie, and let him raise their child as his own. Twenty years later, Frank has died. Claire takes her daughter Brianna to Scotland. Claire discovers that Jamie did not die at Culloden, and vows to return to him.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\nJamie kills Randall at Culloden, but is gravely injured, and spared execution. At Ardsmuir prison, he befriends the governor [[Lord John Grey (character)|Lord John Grey]], who later paroles him to work at an English estate. There Jamie is manipulated into a sexual liaison and fathers an illegitimate son, William. Jamie returns to Scotland and becomes a printer.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1948, Claire enrolls in medical school as she and Frank raise Jamie's daughter, Brianna, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Frank is killed in a car accident while Brianna is in college. With the help of Roger Wakefield, during a trip to Scotland with Brianna, Claire learns some clues to Jamie's fate after Culloden. She returns to the 18th century to find him. She discovers that Jamie has married a widowed Laoghaire. Claire's return nullifies their union, as it is illegal. Jamie and Claire try to retrieve some hidden treasure so that he can placate Laoghaire with a settlement. During this effort, his nephew Ian is captured by pirates and carried off to the Caribbean. Jamie and Claire follow, and manage to rescue him from Geillis, who had escaped burning at the stake. Claire and Jamie set sail for Scotland, but are shipwrecked on the coast of the British colony of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].\n\n===Season 4 (2018\u201319)===\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] of [[Province of North-Carolina|North Carolina]], Claire and Jamie work to find a way to return to Scotland with Fergus, Marsali, and Young Ian. They visit the plantation of Jamie's aunt Jocasta Cameron, where they see conditions of [[slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] firsthand. Claire and Jamie decide to leave the plantation area and make a new life for themselves elsewhere, and claim a piece of land they call Fraser's Ridge. On their new land, tensions rise with the local [[Cherokee]], whose land they've settled on. Jamie reunites with Murtagh, who is now a [[blacksmith]] in a nearby town and leader of the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. And Lord John surprises Jamie and Claire by appearing on Fraser's Ridge with Jamie's son, Willy. \n\nMeanwhile, in the 1970s, Brianna rejects Roger's marriage proposal. After learning her parents will die in a fire, Brianna goes to Inverness and travels through the stones. Roger is given a letter from Brianna stating she has gone through the stones, and he follows her. Brianna makes her way to the colonies, while Roger crosses on a ship captained by Stephen Bonnet.\n\nRoger and Brianna meet in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and enter into a [[handfast marriage]], but quarrel afterward. Brianna is accosted and raped by Bonnet. She finds her parents while in Wilmington, and later discovers she is pregnant. Roger goes to Fraser's Ridge where Jamie wrongly assumes that he was the one who had raped Brianna and beats him. Young Ian sells Roger to the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] as a captive. Discovering their mistake, Claire, Jamie, and Young Ian set off to rescue Roger, and Young Ian trades his freedom for Roger's. Roger and Brianna are reunited at Jocasta's plantation. Jamie receives instructions from the governor to kill Murtagh, who is a fugitive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Outlander characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Only list actors who are credited in the opening titles. -->\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Beauchamp Randall/Fraser]]\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as [[Jamie Fraser (character)|James \"Jamie\" MacKenzie Fraser]]\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as Frank Randall (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Menzies only appears in one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}} / Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Dougal MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132) / William \"Buck\" MacKenzie (season 5){{efn|McTavish only appears in one episode of season five, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Grant O'Rourke as Rupert MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|O'Rourke only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Angus Mhor (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Colum MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Geillis Duncan {{a.k.a.}} Gillian Edgars (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Verbeek only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Edward \"Ned\" Gowan (seasons 1, 3){{efn|Paterson only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham (seasons 1\u20132){{efn|Callow only appears in one episode of season one, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Laura Donnelly (actress)|Laura Donnelly]] as Janet \"Jenny\" Fraser Murray (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Donnelly only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Taran MacQuarrie (season 1)\n* [[Steven Cree]] as Ian Murray (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Cree only appears in one episode of season two and one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stanley Weber]] as [[Count of St. Germain|Le Comte St. Germain]] (season 2)\n* [[Andrew Gower (actor)|Andrew Gower]] as Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (seasons 2\u20133){{efn|Gower only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Rosie Day]] as Mary Hawkins (season 2)\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Master Raymond (season 2)\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Mother Hildegarde (season 2)\n* [[Nell Hudson]] as Laoghaire MacKenzie (seasons 2\u20134;

She had said, 'Oh, I really liked the way you did it. it was a difficult plot, I know, but I think you really found the essence of it. You really found the through line that really defines what this part of the journey is.' ... It\u2019s not going to be a literal adaptation because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible with the second book ... But I think it\u2019s very much the same story, the major characters are all represented, the major scenes are all represented, and it still gets you to all the same places you want to go.<ref name=\"EW 2015-07 First Look\"/>}}\n\nGabaldon was employed as consultant to the TV production.<ref name=\"CordDiana\">{{cite web |last=Cordova |first=Randy |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/books/2014/06/07/diana-gabaldon-returns-new-outlander-book/10042975/ |title=Diana Gabaldon returns with new ''Outlander'' book |work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref> When asked in June 2015 about the adaptation of the first season, she said: \"I think they did condense it very effectively ...

She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love. The Clan suspect her of being a spy, and retain her as a healer, preventing her from attempting to return to her own time. Knowing that the Jacobite cause is doomed to fail, Claire tries to warn them against pursuing a rebellion. Her husband Jamie is captured, tortured, and raped by the sadistic Randall, but Claire and his clansmen rescue him. Claire tells Jamie that she is pregnant and they leave to sail to France.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\nIn Paris, Claire and Jamie try to thwart the Jacobites by subverting the funds that King [[Louis XV of France]] is likely to provide. Jamie becomes the confidante of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Stuart]], but the Frasers fail to prevent the risings. Randall reappears in Paris, but Claire makes Jamie swear to keep him alive until Frank's descent is assured. She achieves this by convincing Randall to marry Mary Hawkins. Claire loses her baby, and she and Jamie return to Scotland. The Jacobites win the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].\n\nBefore the [[Battle of Culloden]], Jamie convinces Claire, pregnant again, to return to the 20th century. Jamie decides to die fighting at Culloden with his clan. Back in her own century, Claire tells Frank about her time travel. He asks her to forget Jamie, and let him raise their child as his own. Twenty years later, Frank has died. Claire takes her daughter Brianna to Scotland. Claire discovers that Jamie did not die at Culloden, and vows to return to him.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\nJamie kills Randall at Culloden, but is gravely injured, and spared execution. At Ardsmuir prison, he befriends the governor [[Lord John Grey (character)|Lord John Grey]], who later paroles him to work at an English estate. There Jamie is manipulated into a sexual liaison and fathers an illegitimate son, William. Jamie returns to Scotland and becomes a printer.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1948, Claire enrolls in medical school as she and Frank raise Jamie's daughter, Brianna, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Frank is killed in a car accident while Brianna is in college. With the help of Roger Wakefield, during a trip to Scotland with Brianna, Claire learns some clues to Jamie's fate after Culloden. She returns to the 18th century to find him. She discovers that Jamie has married a widowed Laoghaire. Claire's return nullifies their union, as it is illegal. Jamie and Claire try to retrieve some hidden treasure so that he can placate Laoghaire with a settlement. During this effort, his nephew Ian is captured by pirates and carried off to the Caribbean. Jamie and Claire follow, and manage to rescue him from Geillis, who had escaped burning at the stake. Claire and Jamie set sail for Scotland, but are shipwrecked on the coast of the British colony of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].\n\n===Season 4 (2018\u201319)===\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] of [[Province of North-Carolina|North Carolina]], Claire and Jamie work to find a way to return to Scotland with Fergus, Marsali, and Young Ian. They visit the plantation of Jamie's aunt Jocasta Cameron, where they see conditions of [[slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] firsthand. Claire and Jamie decide to leave the plantation area and make a new life for themselves elsewhere, and claim a piece of land they call Fraser's Ridge. On their new land, tensions rise with the local [[Cherokee]], whose land they've settled on. Jamie reunites with Murtagh, who is now a [[blacksmith]] in a nearby town and leader of the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. And Lord John surprises Jamie and Claire by appearing on Fraser's Ridge with Jamie's son, Willy. \n\nMeanwhile, in the 1970s, Brianna rejects Roger's marriage proposal. After learning her parents will die in a fire, Brianna goes to Inverness and travels through the stones. Roger is given a letter from Brianna stating she has gone through the stones, and he follows her. Brianna makes her way to the colonies, while Roger crosses on a ship captained by Stephen Bonnet.\n\nRoger and Brianna meet in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and enter into a [[handfast marriage]], but quarrel afterward. Brianna is accosted and raped by Bonnet. She finds her parents while in Wilmington, and later discovers she is pregnant. Roger goes to Fraser's Ridge where Jamie wrongly assumes that he was the one who had raped Brianna and beats him. Young Ian sells Roger to the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] as a captive. Discovering their mistake, Claire, Jamie, and Young Ian set off to rescue Roger, and Young Ian trades his freedom for Roger's. Roger and Brianna are reunited at Jocasta's plantation.

In the north side there are the mountains, from the [[Southern Carpathians]] group \u2013 the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] with [[Moldoveanu Peak]] (2,544 m), [[Negoiu Peak]] (2,535 m) and V\u00e2n\u0103toarea lui Buteanu peak (2,508 m) towering the region, and in the North-East part the [[Leaot\u0103 Mountains]]. Between them there is a pass towards [[Bra\u0219ov]], the [[Ruc\u0103r-Bran Passage]]. The heights decrease, and in the center there are the sub-carpathian hills, with heights around 800 m, crossed with very deep valleys. In the south there is the northern part of the [[Romanian Plain]].\n\nThe main river that crosses the county is the [[Arge\u0219 River]] in which almost all the other rivers coming from the mountains flow. In the south the main rivers are the [[Vedea River]] and the [[Teleorman River]].\n\n===Neighbours===\n*[[D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County]] in the east.\n*[[V\u00e2lcea County]] and [[Olt County]] in the west.\n*[[Sibiu County]] and [[Bra\u0219ov County]] in the north.\n*[[Teleorman County]] in the south.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Romanian counties map|width=250px}}\nThe county is one of the most industrialized counties in [[Romania]]. There is one oil refinery and two automobile plants at [[Mioveni]] \u2013 the [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]] Renault car plant, and at [[C\u00e2mpulung]] the [[ARO]] plant.\n\nThe predominant industries in the county are:\n* Automotive\n* Chemical\n* Electrical equipment\n* Home appliances\n* Food\n* Textiles\n* Construction materials\n\nOil is being extracted in the center and in the south. Also there are a few coal mines and close to Mioveni there is a nuclear research and production facility making nuclear fuels for the [[Cernavod\u0103]] [[nuclear power plant|Nuclear Electric Power Plant]]. On the [[Arge\u0219 River]] there are a great number of hydroelectric power plants, the most impressive being the [[Vidraru]] power plant and dam.\n\nThe hillsides are well suited for wines and fruit orchards, and the south is suited for cereal crops.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe main tourist destinations are:\n* The city of Pite\u0219ti\n* The city of [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]], where [[Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral|one of the most well known monasteries]] in Romania is located\n* The [[C\u00e2mpulung]] \u2013 [[Ruc\u0103r]] area\n* The [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 the

In the north side there are the mountains, from the [[Southern Carpathians]] group \u2013 the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] with [[Moldoveanu Peak]] (2,544 m), [[Negoiu Peak]] (2,535 m) and V\u00e2n\u0103toarea lui Buteanu peak (2,508 m) towering the region, and in the North-East part the [[Leaot\u0103 Mountains]]. Between them there is a pass towards [[Bra\u0219ov]], the [[Ruc\u0103r-Bran Passage]]. The heights decrease, and in the center there are the sub-carpathian hills, with heights around 800 m, crossed with very deep valleys. In the south there is the northern part of the [[Romanian Plain]].\n\nThe main river that crosses the county is the [[Arge\u0219 River]] in which almost all the other rivers coming from the mountains flow. In the south the main rivers are the [[Vedea River]] and the [[Teleorman River]].\n\n===Neighbours===\n*[[D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County]] in the east.\n*[[V\u00e2lcea County]] and [[Olt County]] in the west.\n*[[Sibiu County]] and [[Bra\u0219ov County]] in the north.\n*[[Teleorman County]] in the south.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Romanian counties map|width=250px}}\nThe county is one of the most industrialized counties in [[Romania]].

These avenues are connected, in turn, by other avenues such as Avenida Venezuela, Avenida La Marina, Avenida Salaverry, Avenida C\u00e1ceres, among others, which almost form a ring around the downtown. Other avenues such as: Avenida Cayma, Avenida Goyeneche, and Avenida Dolores link the suburbs and nearby districts with downtown Arequipa. Interchanges such as the one at Avenida La Marina and another one at Avenida Caceres help to relieve urban traffic. A road of 40&nbsp;km approximately, which goes through the district of [[Uchumayo District|Uchumayo]], connects Arequipa to the [[Pan-American Highway]] and coastal cities; another road goes through the district of [[Yura District|Yura]], connecting Arequipa to other cities in the southern highlands like Puno and Cuzco.\n\nPublic transit in Arequipa is currently operated by small private companies. In 2014, a [[rapid transit|metro]] system was proposed by Peru's then-[[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Peru) |minister for transport]] Jos\u00e9 Gallardo.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://andina.pe/ingles/noticia-arequipa-to-be-second-city-in-peru-to-get-metro-system-521783.aspx|title= Arequipa to be second city in Peru to get metro system|website=[[Andina (news agency)|Andina]]|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Full Runway SPQU 01.jpg|thumb|View of the apron at Rodriguez Ballon International Airport with the Misti volcano in the background.|alt=|240x240px]]\nArequipa's only airport is [[Rodr\u00edguez Ball\u00f3n International Airport]], which is operated by a private consortium through a concession granted by the government since 2011.<ref name=\"Tr\u00e1fico\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.andina.com.pe/espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=mLn7DHtFef8= |title=Airport Concession South Andean |access-date=11 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530040059/http://www.andina.com.pe/espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=mLn7DHtFef8= |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is located in the district of [[Cerro Colorado District|Cerro Colorado]], about {{convert|12|mi|0|abbr=off}} northwest of the downtown, and because of its features and facilities is considered one of the best in the country<ref name=\"export26p\">Mincetur. \"Export Investment Guide\", p. 26.</ref> There are regular flights to Peruvian destinations such as [[Lima]], [[Cusco|Cuzco]], [[Tacna]] and [[Juliaca]] and to international destinations such as [[Arica]], [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]] and [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"export26p\" />\n\nThe railway network system has been operating in Arequipa since 1871, and enables communication between the coast and the mountains and different levels of progress and expansion of population centers located in its path. The system consists of the lines Cusco-Puno-Arequipa and Arequipa-Mollendo.  It is of great strategic importance in the multimodal communication system in the southern macro region, since it is the most effective and economical way to transport heavy loads over long distances.\n\n''Terrapuerto Internacional Arequipa'' is a bus terminal located in the district of Jacobo Hunter. There, several bus companies offer land travel routes to regional and national destinations within Peru and to international destinations such as [[La Paz, Honduras|La Paz]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Buenos Aires]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Peru}}\n\nThe city of Arequipa is actively involved in town twinning policy reason has had throughout its history various [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] with different cities and regions.

Economic growth was stimulated by several milestones: the discovery and industrial exploitation of oil in 1857, the political union between [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] in 1859, land reforms, adoption of a local currency, the [[Romanian leu|leu]] (1867), the state independence (1877), as well as the building of an extensive rail-road system under king Carol I.\n\nAfter the dissolution of neighbouring [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] empires following World War I, several Romanian-speaking provinces ([[Transylvania]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Banat]], [[Bukovina]]) united with the Kingdom of Romania, forming the Romanian state in its modern form. The application of radical agricultural reforms and the passing of a new constitution created a democratic framework and allowed for quick economic growth (industrial production doubled between 1923\u20131938, despite the effects of the [[Great Depression]]).\n\nUntil World War II, Romania was Europe's second-largest oil and food producer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/motoring/europa/7306099/Business-in-Romania-a-country-thats-fast-off-the-Bloc.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Business in Romania: a country that's fast off the Bloc \u2013 Two years of EU membership have transformed the business face of Romania and savvy UK firms are reaping the rewards.

During this period the country experienced rapid [[industrialization]] in an attempt to create a \"multilaterally developed socialist society\". Economic growth was further fuelled by foreign credits in the 1970s, eventually leading to a growing foreign debt, which peaked at $11\u201312 billion.<ref>Klepper, Nicolae. ROMANIA An Illustrated History. NY:Hippocrene Books, Inc., 2002, page 230</ref>\n\nRomania's debt was largely paid off during the 1980s by implementing [[Austerity in Romania|severe austerity measures]] which deprived Romanians of basic consumer goods.

Romania's weight in the global economy dropped to 0,3% in 1993 down from 0,8% in 1983.\n\n[[Privatization]] of industry started with the 1992 transfer of 30% of the shares of some 6,000 state-owned enterprises to five private ownership funds, in which each adult citizen received certificates of ownership. The remaining 70% ownership of the enterprises was transferred to a state ownership fund, with a mandate to sell off its shares at the rate of at least 10% per year. The privatization law also called for direct sale of some 30 specially selected enterprises and the sale of \"assets\" (i.e., commercially viable component units) of larger enterprises.\n\nAs of 2008, inflation stood at 7.8%, up from 4.8% in 2007<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ro.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> estimated by the [[National Bank of Romania|BNR]] at coming within 6% for the year 2006 (the year-on-year [[consumer price index|CPI]], published in March 2007, is 3.66%).

Congress approved restoration of the MFN status effective 8 November 1993, as part of a new bilateral trade agreement. Tariffs on most Romanian products dropped to zero in February 1994 with the inclusion of Romania in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Major Romanian exports to the U.S. include shoes and clothing, steel, and chemicals.\n\nRomania signed an [[Association Agreement]] with the EU in 1992 and a free trade agreement with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1993, codifying Romania's access to European markets and creating the basic framework for further economic integration. Romania formally joined the EU in 2007.\n\nDuring the later part of the Ceau\u015fescu period, Romania had earned significant contracts from several developing countries, notably Iraq, for oil-related projects. In August 2005 Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1.7 billion debt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the U.S.-led \"[[Coalition of the Willing]]\", making Romania the first country outside of the [[Paris Club]] of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombiz.ro/Romania_isi_va_recupera_datoriile_din_Irak_--a65579.html|title=Romania isi va recupera datoriile din Irak \u2013 BloomBiz.ro \u2013 Your Business Community<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=BloomBiz.ro|access-date=24 September 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nGrowth in 2000\u201307 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Italy and Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. Current account deficits of around 2% of GDP are beginning to decline{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as demand for Romanian products in the European Union increases. Accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform.\n\nIn early 2004 the government passed increases in the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned bank [[Banca Comercial\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]] took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds is expected to accelerate economic growth.

This led to some immediate international trade liberalization. Romania is part of the European single market which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union members and by EU legislation. This is to be contrasted with enormous [[List of countries by current account balance|current account deficits]]. Low [[interest rate]]s guarantee availability of funds for investment and consumption. For example, a boom in the [[real estate market]] started around 2000 and has not subsided yet. At the same time annual inflation in the economy is variable and during the mid-2000s (2003\u20132008) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.8%.\n\nRomania adopted 1 January 2005 a [[flat tax]] of 16% to improve tax collection rates. Romania subsequently enjoyed the lowest fiscal burden in the European Union, until Bulgaria also switched to a flat tax of 10% in 2007. Since 2018 the flat rate was lowered to 10%.\n\nRomania posted 6% economic growth in 2016, the highest among European Union member states.

Industry and construction accounted for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, a comparatively large share even without taking into account related services. The sector employed 26.4% of the workforce. Romania excels in the production of [[automobiles]], [[machine tools]], and chemicals. In 2013, some 410,997 [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|automobiles]] were produced in Romania, up from 78,165 in 2000. As of 2018, the turnover generated by Romania's automobile industry was estimated at 28 billion Euros, with 230,000 Romanians employed in the sector.<ref>https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-automotive-industry-2018</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Romania enjoyed one of the largest world market share in machine tools (5.3%).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Romanian-based companies such as [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]], [[Petrom]], [[Rompetrol]], [[Bitdefender]], [[Romstal]] and [[Mobexpert]] have expanded operations throughout the region. However, small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms form the bulk of Romania's industrial sector.\n\nRomania's industrial output is expected to advance 9% in 2007, while agriculture output is projected to grow 12%. Final consumption is also expected to increase by 11% overall \u2013 individual consumption by 14.4% and collective consumption by 10.4%. Domestic demand is expected to go up 12.7%.\n\nIndustrial output growth was 6.9% year-on-year in December 2009, making it the highest in the EU-27 zone which averaged \u22121.9%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financiarul.ro/2010/02/15/romania-reports-highest-december-2009-industrial-output-growth-in-eu27-2/|title=Romania reports highest December 2009 industrial output growth in EU27 - FINANCIARUL - ultimele stiri din Finante, Banci, Economie, Imobiliare si IT|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRomania has the third-highest percentage of women working in information and communications technologies (ICT) in Europe. 29% of their workforce is made up of women.<ref name=\"qz.com\"/>\n\n===Services===\n{{Main|Services in Romania}}\nIn 2003 [[service sector]] constituted 55% of gross domestic product (GDP), and the sector employed 51.3% of the workforce. The subcomponents of services are financial, renting, and business activities (20.5%); trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport (18%); and other service activities (21.7%). The service sector in Romania has expanded in recent years, employing some 47% of Romanians and accounting for slightly more than half of GDP.\n\nThe largest employer is the retail sector, employing almost 12% of Romanians. The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of chain stores clustered together in shopping malls. In recent years the rise of [[big-box store]]s, such as [[Cora (hypermarket)]] (of the France) and [[Carrefour]] (a subsidiary of the French), have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.\n\n==Biotechnology industry==\nRomania is aggressively promoting and developing its biotechnology industry. Hundred of millions of dollars were invested into the sector to build up infrastructure, fund research and development and to recruit top international scientists to Romania. Romania features one of the world's newest competitive bio-industries, in key areas as pharmacogenomics, protein engineering, glyco-engineering, tissue engineering, bio-informatics, genome medicine and preventive medicine. Romania is devoting substantial resources to developing universities and R&D facilities, increasing bioventure startups, growing bio-clusters (communities of biotechnology companies and institutions) and developing human resources, all with the goal of making it one of the world's most advanced biotechnology regions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Regional variation==\nThe strength of the Romanian economy varies from region to region.

Economic growth was stimulated by several milestones: the discovery and industrial exploitation of oil in 1857, the political union between [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] in 1859, land reforms, adoption of a local currency, the [[Romanian leu|leu]] (1867), the state independence (1877), as well as the building of an extensive rail-road system under king Carol I.\n\nAfter the dissolution of neighbouring [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] empires following World War I, several Romanian-speaking provinces ([[Transylvania]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Banat]], [[Bukovina]]) united with the Kingdom of Romania, forming the Romanian state in its modern form. The application of radical agricultural reforms and the passing of a new constitution created a democratic framework and allowed for quick economic growth (industrial production doubled between 1923\u20131938, despite the effects of the [[Great Depression]]).\n\nUntil World War II, Romania was Europe's second-largest oil and food producer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/motoring/europa/7306099/Business-in-Romania-a-country-thats-fast-off-the-Bloc.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Business in Romania: a country that's fast off the Bloc \u2013 Two years of EU membership have transformed the business face of Romania and savvy UK firms are reaping the rewards.

During this period the country experienced rapid [[industrialization]] in an attempt to create a \"multilaterally developed socialist society\". Economic growth was further fuelled by foreign credits in the 1970s, eventually leading to a growing foreign debt, which peaked at $11\u201312 billion.<ref>Klepper, Nicolae.

Romania's weight in the global economy dropped to 0,3% in 1993 down from 0,8% in 1983.\n\n[[Privatization]] of industry started with the 1992 transfer of 30% of the shares of some 6,000 state-owned enterprises to five private ownership funds, in which each adult citizen received certificates of ownership. The remaining 70% ownership of the enterprises was transferred to a state ownership fund, with a mandate to sell off its shares at the rate of at least 10% per year. The privatization law also called for direct sale of some 30 specially selected enterprises and the sale of \"assets\" (i.e., commercially viable component units) of larger enterprises.\n\nAs of 2008, inflation stood at 7.8%, up from 4.8% in 2007<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ro.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> estimated by the [[National Bank of Romania|BNR]] at coming within 6% for the year 2006 (the year-on-year [[consumer price index|CPI]], published in March 2007, is 3.66%).

Congress approved restoration of the MFN status effective 8 November 1993, as part of a new bilateral trade agreement. Tariffs on most Romanian products dropped to zero in February 1994 with the inclusion of Romania in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Major Romanian exports to the U.S. include shoes and clothing, steel, and chemicals.\n\nRomania signed an [[Association Agreement]] with the EU in 1992 and a free trade agreement with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1993, codifying Romania's access to European markets and creating the basic framework for further economic integration. Romania formally joined the EU in 2007.\n\nDuring the later part of the Ceau\u015fescu period, Romania had earned significant contracts from several developing countries, notably Iraq, for oil-related projects. In August 2005 Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1.7 billion debt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the U.S.-led \"[[Coalition of the Willing]]\", making Romania the first country outside of the [[Paris Club]] of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombiz.ro/Romania_isi_va_recupera_datoriile_din_Irak_--a65579.html|title=Romania isi va recupera datoriile din Irak \u2013 BloomBiz.ro \u2013 Your Business Community<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=BloomBiz.ro|access-date=24 September 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nGrowth in 2000\u201307 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Italy and Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment.

Current account deficits of around 2% of GDP are beginning to decline{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as demand for Romanian products in the European Union increases. Accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform.\n\nIn early 2004 the government passed increases in the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned bank [[Banca Comercial\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]] took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds is expected to accelerate economic growth.

This led to some immediate international trade liberalization. Romania is part of the European single market which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union members and by EU legislation. This is to be contrasted with enormous [[List of countries by current account balance|current account deficits]]. Low [[interest rate]]s guarantee availability of funds for investment and consumption. For example, a boom in the [[real estate market]] started around 2000 and has not subsided yet. At the same time annual inflation in the economy is variable and during the mid-2000s (2003\u20132008) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.8%.\n\nRomania adopted 1 January 2005 a [[flat tax]] of 16% to improve tax collection rates. Romania subsequently enjoyed the lowest fiscal burden in the European Union, until Bulgaria also switched to a flat tax of 10% in 2007. Since 2018 the flat rate was lowered to 10%.\n\nRomania posted 6% economic growth in 2016, the highest among European Union member states.

Romania is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the reforms and the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.\n\n====Fishing====\nFishing is an economic mainstay in parts of eastern Romania and along the Black Sea coast, with important fish markets in places such as [[Constanta]], [[Galati]] and [[Tulcea]]. Fish such as [[european anchovy]], sprat, [[pontic shad]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], goby, whiting, [[garfish]], [[Black-Sea Turbot]] or [[horse mackerel]] are landed at ports such as [[Constanta]].\n\nThere has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Romania due to the EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]], which places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, caused by overfishing in the [[Black Sea]]. Along with the decline of sea-fishing, commercial [[fish farming|fish farms]] \u2013 especially in [[salmon]], have increased in prominence in the rivers and [[lochs]] of the east of Romania. Inland waters are rich in fresh water fish such as salmon, [[trout]], and in particular, carp which traditionally has been the most popular fish, including its eggs (''icre''), fresh or canned.\n\n===Industry===\n{{Main|Industry of Romania}}\n{{See also|Industrial development in the Principality of Wallachia}}\n\n====Car industry====\n[[File:2018 Dacia Duster.jpg|thumb|2018 [[Dacia Duster]]]]\n\n====IT and other Industry====\nRomania has been successful in developing its industrial sector in recent years. Industry and construction accounted for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, a comparatively large share even without taking into account related services. The sector employed 26.4% of the workforce. Romania excels in the production of [[automobiles]], [[machine tools]], and chemicals. In 2013, some 410,997 [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|automobiles]] were produced in Romania, up from 78,165 in 2000.

However, small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms form the bulk of Romania's industrial sector.\n\nRomania's industrial output is expected to advance 9% in 2007, while agriculture output is projected to grow 12%. Final consumption is also expected to increase by 11% overall \u2013 individual consumption by 14.4% and collective consumption by 10.4%.

The service sector in Romania has expanded in recent years, employing some 47% of Romanians and accounting for slightly more than half of GDP.\n\nThe largest employer is the retail sector, employing almost 12% of Romanians. The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of chain stores clustered together in shopping malls. In recent years the rise of [[big-box store]]s, such as [[Cora (hypermarket)]] (of the France) and [[Carrefour]] (a subsidiary of the French), have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.\n\n==Biotechnology industry==\nRomania is aggressively promoting and developing its biotechnology industry. Hundred of millions of dollars were invested into the sector to build up infrastructure, fund research and development and to recruit top international scientists to Romania. Romania features one of the world's newest competitive bio-industries, in key areas as pharmacogenomics, protein engineering, glyco-engineering, tissue engineering, bio-informatics, genome medicine and preventive medicine.

One snake has the normal colour while the other has melanistic colour/pattern form. The head of the normal snake is enclosed in a half-coil of the melanistic form.|''V. berus'': normal and melanistic colour patterns]]\nThe head is fairly large and distinct and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The edge of the snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the [[rostral scale]] is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish [[Frontal scale|frontal]] (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two [[Parietal scales|parietals]] (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow [[supraoculars]]. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large [[nasal scale]]. The eye is relatively large\u2014equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale\u2014but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small [[circumorbital scales]]. The [[temporal scales]] are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10\u201312 [[sublabials]] and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) [[supralabials]]. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\nMidbody there are 21 [[dorsal scales]] rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are strongly [[keeled scales]], except for those bordering the [[ventral scales]]. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice as wide as the ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132\u2013150 in males and 132\u2013158 in females. The [[anal plate]] is single. The [[Subcaudal scales|subcaudals]] are paired, numbering 32\u201346 in males and 23\u201338 in females.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\nThe colour pattern varies, ranging from very light-coloured specimens with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, and on to melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most have some kind of zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> Unusually for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Viperaberus2.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A common adder basking in the open upon loose moss litter with head resting upon its coil and facing away.

It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it has been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nAdders are not usually aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are generally bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these turn out to be pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nThe species is cold-adapted and hibernates in the winter. In Great Britain, males and females hibernate for about 150 and 180 days, respectively. In northern Sweden hibernation lasts 8\u20139 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge to bask where the snow has melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30\u201340% of juveniles die during hibernation.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\n==Feeding==\n[[File:Common European Adder.jpg|thumb|''V. berus'' female; head detail.]]\nDiet consists mainly of small mammals, such as mice, rats, voles, and shrews, as well as lizards. Sometimes, slow worms are taken, and even weasels and moles. They feed on amphibians, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. Birds are also reported<ref name=\"Leighton\">{{cite book |title=The Life-History of British Serpents and Their Local Distribution in the British Isles |last=Leighton |first=Gerald R. |year=1901 |publisher=Blackwood & Sons |location=Edinburgh & London |isbn=1-4446-3091-1 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7i_8ZmymfMoC |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> to be consumed, especially nestlings and even eggs, for which they will climb into shrubbery and bushes. Generally, diet varies depending on locality.<ref name=\"Str79\"/> Juveniles will eat nestling mammals, small lizards and frogs as well as worms and spiders. Once they reach about {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length, their diet begins to resemble that of the adults.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nIn Hungary, mating takes place in the last week of April, whilst in the north it happens later (in the second week of May). Mating has also been observed in June and even early October, but it is not known if this autumn mating results in any offspring.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> Females often breed once every two years,<ref name=\"Str79\"/> or even once every three years if the seasons are short and the climate is not conducive.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n[[File:Viperaberus1.jpg|thumb|alt=Closeup of snake coils with head resting on coil looking front and left. The gray dorsal scales on the thick coils are clearly seen as having prominent keels.| ''V. berus'' \u2013 showing strongly [[keeled scales]] on dorsal area.]]\nMales find females by following their scent trails, sometimes tracking them for hundreds of metres a day. If a female is found and then flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel 'flowing' behaviour, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together for one or two days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behaviour before culminating in the dramatic 'adder dance'.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Appleby (1971) notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate.<ref>Appleby LG. (1971). ''British Snakes''. London: J. Baker. 150 pp. {{ISBN|0-212-98393-8}}.</ref> There is no record of any biting taking place during these bouts.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nFemales usually give birth in August or September, but sometimes as early as July, or as late as early October. Litters range in size from 3 to 20. The young are usually born encased in a transparent sac from which they must free themselves. Sometimes, they succeed in freeing themselves from this membrane while still inside the female. The neonates measure {{convert|14|to|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length (including tail), with an average total length of {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are born with a fully functional venom apparatus and a reserve supply of yolk within their bodies. They shed their skins for the first time within a day or two. Females do not appear to take much interest in their offspring, but the young have been observed to remain near their mothers for several days after birth.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\n==Venom==\n[[File: Vipera berus - Venom delivery apparatus.JPG |thumb|250px|left|''Vipera berus'' - Venom delivery apparatus]]\nBecause of the rapid rate of human expansion throughout the range of this species, [[Snakebite|bites]] are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March\u2013October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 bites a year, with an estimated 12% that require hospitalisation.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> At least eight different [[antivenom]]s are available against bites from this species.<ref name=\"MAVIN\">[http://www.toxinfo.org/antivenoms/indication/VIPERA_BERUS.html ''Vipera berus'' antivenoms] at [http://www.toxinfo.org/antivenoms/ Munich Antivenom Index].

It feeds on small [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[amphibian]]s, and in some cases on [[spider]]s, [[worm]]s, and [[insect]]s. The common adder, like most other vipers, is [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]. Females breed once every two or three years, with litters usually being born in late [[summer]] to early [[autumn]] in the Northern Hemisphere.

One snake has the normal colour while the other has melanistic colour/pattern form. The head of the normal snake is enclosed in a half-coil of the melanistic form.|''V. berus'': normal and melanistic colour patterns]]\nThe head is fairly large and distinct and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The edge of the snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the [[rostral scale]] is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish [[Frontal scale|frontal]] (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two [[Parietal scales|parietals]] (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow [[supraoculars]]. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large [[nasal scale]]. The eye is relatively large\u2014equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale\u2014but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small [[circumorbital scales]]. The [[temporal scales]] are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10\u201312 [[sublabials]] and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) [[supralabials]]. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\nMidbody there are 21 [[dorsal scales]] rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are strongly [[keeled scales]], except for those bordering the [[ventral scales]]. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice as wide as the ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132\u2013150 in males and 132\u2013158 in females. The [[anal plate]] is single. The [[Subcaudal scales|subcaudals]] are paired, numbering 32\u201346 in males and 23\u201338 in females.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\nThe colour pattern varies, ranging from very light-coloured specimens with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, and on to melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most have some kind of zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> Unusually for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Viperaberus2.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A common adder basking in the open upon loose moss litter with head resting upon its coil and facing away. The central part of its body is thick and it has probaby eaten recently.|''V. berus'']]\n''Vipera berus'' has a wide range.

It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it has been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nAdders are not usually aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are generally bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these turn out to be pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nThe species is cold-adapted and hibernates in the winter. In Great Britain, males and females hibernate for about 150 and 180 days, respectively. In northern Sweden hibernation lasts 8\u20139 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge to bask where the snow has melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30\u201340% of juveniles die during hibernation.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\n==Feeding==\n[[File:Common European Adder.jpg|thumb|''V. berus'' female; head detail.]]\nDiet consists mainly of small mammals, such as mice, rats, voles, and shrews, as well as lizards. Sometimes, slow worms are taken, and even weasels and moles. They feed on amphibians, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. Birds are also reported<ref name=\"Leighton\">{{cite book |title=The Life-History of British Serpents and Their Local Distribution in the British Isles |last=Leighton |first=Gerald R. |year=1901 |publisher=Blackwood & Sons |location=Edinburgh & London |isbn=1-4446-3091-1 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7i_8ZmymfMoC |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> to be consumed, especially nestlings and even eggs, for which they will climb into shrubbery and bushes. Generally, diet varies depending on locality.<ref name=\"Str79\"/> Juveniles will eat nestling mammals, small lizards and frogs as well as worms and spiders. Once they reach about {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length, their diet begins to resemble that of the adults.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nIn Hungary, mating takes place in the last week of April, whilst in the north it happens later (in the second week of May). Mating has also been observed in June and even early October, but it is not known if this autumn mating results in any offspring.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> Females often breed once every two years,<ref name=\"Str79\"/> or even once every three years if the seasons are short and the climate is not conducive.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/>\n[[File:Viperaberus1.jpg|thumb|alt=Closeup of snake coils with head resting on coil looking front and left. The gray dorsal scales on the thick coils are clearly seen as having prominent keels.| ''V. berus'' \u2013 showing strongly [[keeled scales]] on dorsal area.]]\nMales find females by following their scent trails, sometimes tracking them for hundreds of metres a day. If a female is found and then flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel 'flowing' behaviour, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together for one or two days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behaviour before culminating in the dramatic 'adder dance'.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Appleby (1971) notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate.<ref>Appleby LG. (1971). ''British Snakes''. London: J. Baker. 150 pp. {{ISBN|0-212-98393-8}}.</ref> There is no record of any biting taking place during these bouts.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\nFemales usually give birth in August or September, but sometimes as early as July, or as late as early October. Litters range in size from 3 to 20. The young are usually born encased in a transparent sac from which they must free themselves. Sometimes, they succeed in freeing themselves from this membrane while still inside the female. The neonates measure {{convert|14|to|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length (including tail), with an average total length of {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are born with a fully functional venom apparatus and a reserve supply of yolk within their bodies. They shed their skins for the first time within a day or two. Females do not appear to take much interest in their offspring, but the young have been observed to remain near their mothers for several days after birth.<ref name=\"Str79\"/>\n\n==Venom==\n[[File: Vipera berus - Venom delivery apparatus.JPG |thumb|250px|left|''Vipera berus'' - Venom delivery apparatus]]\nBecause of the rapid rate of human expansion throughout the range of this species, [[Snakebite|bites]] are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March\u2013October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 bites a year, with an estimated 12% that require hospitalisation.<ref name=\"Mal03\"/> At least eight different [[antivenom]]s are available against bites from this species.<ref name=\"MAVIN\">[http://www.toxinfo.org/antivenoms/indication/VIPERA_BERUS.html ''Vipera berus'' antivenoms] at [http://www.toxinfo.org/antivenoms/ Munich Antivenom Index].

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of education became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.

The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.

Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling the creation of faithful reconstructions, they seldom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] rites and art.\n\nIn South and Southwest Asia, Neolithic [[Archaeological culture|cultures]] appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the [[K\u0151r\u00f6s culture|Star\u010devo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vin\u010da]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Copper Complex: North America's First Miners & Metal Artisans|url=http://copperculture.homestead.com/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jeeun|title=The History of Metallurgy and Mining in the Andean Region|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/1011/pope/sje2.html|website=World History at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=Pre-Incan Metallurgy Discovered|url=http://www.livescience.com/1442-pre-incan-metallurgy-discovered.html|website=Live Science|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado|first1=Blanco D.|title=Tarascan Copper Metallurgy at the Site of Itzipar\u00e1tzico, Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico|journal=Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies|date=2003|url=http://www.famsi.org/reports/02063/02063Maldonado01.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNeolithic [[List of archaeological sites|settlements and \"cities\"]] include:\n* [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]] in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC\n* [[Jericho]] in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier [[Epipaleolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]\n* [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC\n* [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Turkey]], 7,500 BC\n* [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Pakistan]], 7,000 BC\n* [[Knap of Howar]] and [[Skara Brae]], the [[Orkney Islands]], [[Prehistoric Scotland|Scotland]], from 3,500 BC\n* over 3,000 settlements of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present-day [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] from 5,400\u20132,800 BC.\n\nThe Neolithic people in the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Central Asia]] were great builders, utilizing [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The Mediterranean Neolithic cultures of [[Malta]] worshiped in [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]].\n\nIn Europe, [[Neolithic long house|long houses]] built from [[wattle and daub]] were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousands still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s flint mines and [[cursus]] monuments.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Urfa.jpg|''[[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]'' in [[Turkey]], founded in 10th millennium BC and abandoned in 8th millennium BC\nFile:Trypillian house2.jpg|Pottery miniature of a [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian]] house\nFile:Cucuteni MNIR IMG 7622.JPG|Miniature of a regular Cucuteni-Trypillian house, full of ceramic vessels\nFile:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]] ([[Mainland, Orkney]], [[Scotland]], UK)\n</gallery>\n\n==Antiquity==\n\n===Ancient Mesopotamia===\n{{Main|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}\nAncient [[Mesopotamia]] is most noted for its construction of mud brick buildings and the construction of [[ziggurat]]s, occupying a prominent place in each city and consisting of an artificial mound, often rising in huge steps, surmounted by a temple. The mound was no doubt to elevate the temple to a commanding position in what was otherwise a flat river valley. The great city of [[Uruk]] had a number of religious precincts, containing many temples larger and more ambitious than any buildings previously known.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risebero|first1=Bill|title=The Story of Western Architecture|date=2018|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-3500-9212-9|page=13|url=|language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe word ''ziggurat'' is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ''ziqqurratum'', the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb ''zaqaru'', (\"to be high\"). The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]], excavated by [[Leonard Woolley]], is 64 by 46 meters at base and originally some 12 meters in height with three stories. It was built under [[Ur-Nammu]] (circa 2100 B.C.) and rebuilt under [[Nabonidus]] (555\u2013539 B.C.), when it was increased in height to probably seven stories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg22/home.html|website=Mesopotamia.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nAssyrian palaces had a large public court with a suite of apartments on the east side and a series of large banqueting halls on the south side.

[[Harvest]]s for example were seen as the benevolence of [[fertility]] deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the city and her most important buildings (the [[palace]] and [[temple]]) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by [[rituals]] intended to enter human activity into continued divine [[benediction]].\n\nAncient architecture is characterized by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of nature outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the gods. The architect, be he [[priest]] or [[monarch|king]], was not the sole important figure, he was merely part of a continuing tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|A view of the pyramids at Giza.

Minoan buildings often had flat, tiled roofs; [[plaster]], wood or [[flagstone]] floors, and stood two to three stories high. Lower [[wall]]s were typically constructed of stone and [[rubble]], and the upper walls of [[mudbrick]]. Ceiling timbers held up the roofs. The main colors used in Minoan frescos were black ([[carbonaceous shale]]), white ([[hydrate]] of lime), red ([[hematite]]), yellow ([[ochre]]), blue ([[silicate of cooper]]) and green (yellow and blue mixed together). The most iconic Minoan building is the [[Palace of Knossos]], being connected to the mythological story of [[Minotaur|The Bull of Minos]], since it is in this palace where it was written that the labyrinth existed.\n\n[[File:Lions-Gate-Mycenae.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]], built in circa 1250 BC, an iconic Mycenaean building]]\nA common characteristic of the Minoan architecture were [[flat roof]]s. The rooms of villas didn't have windows to the streets, the light arriving from courtyards. In the 2nd millennium BC, the villas had one or two floors, and the palaces even three. One of the most notable Minoan contributions to architecture is their inverted column, wider at the top than the base (unlike most Greek columns, which are wider at the bottom to give an impression of height). The columns were made of wood (not stone) and were generally painted red. Mounted on a simple stone base, they were topped with a pillow-like, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]].<ref>Benton and DiYanni 1998, p. 67.</ref><ref>Bourbon 1998, p 34</ref>\n\n[[Aegean art]] reached its peak in circa 1650-1450 BC and was at first dominated by the Minoans. However, at the height of its influence, the Minoan civilization fell and its position was quickly inherited by the [[Mycenaean civilization|Mycenaeans]], a race of warriors who flourished in Greece from 1600 to 1200 BC. Although Cretan artisans may have been employed on the reworking of Mycenaean citadels, the two styles remained distinct. Mycenaean buildings were carefully planned and focused on the [[megaron]] (central unit), while the Minoans favoured complex, labyrinthine forms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=86|url=|language=en}}</ref>  Mycenaean columns, like the Minoan examples, were slender and tapered sharply downwords.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=89|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Minoan Room (35142219872).jpg|Queen's Megaron from the [[Palace of Knossos]], with the Dolphin fresco.

Civic life gained importance for all members of the community. In the time of the ancients religious matters were only handled by the ruling class; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or ''[[polis]]''. Ancient Greek architecture was fundamentally a representation of timber [[post and lintel]], or \"trabeated\" construction in stone, and most surviving buildings are temples. Rows of tall columns supported a [[lintel]], which in turn supported a pitched roof structure running the length of the building. The triangular [[gable]] formed at either end of the pitched roof was often heavily decorated and was a key feature of the style. Today we think of Classical and Hellenist Greek architecture as being characterized by the use of plain white marble, but originally it would have been brightly painted in gaudy colors. For example, [[Doric order]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s were painted with geometric and leaf patterns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson Cragoe|first1=Carol|title=How To Read Buildings A crash course in architecture|date=2017|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-912217-30-4|page=24 & 25|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of [[Doric order|Doric]] (left three), [[Ionic order|Ionic]] (middle three) and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] (right two) columns]]\nGreek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the ''[[agora]]'', which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The ''agora'' embodied the newfound respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the [[acropolis]] for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens.\n\nGreek architecture was typically made of stone. Most surviving buildings are temples, based on strict rules of proportion. These temples typically included a [[peristyle]] (outer area with (typically Doric) columns), and three-sections in the middle, being 1. the [[Pronaos|pronaus]] (entrance), 2. the main [[cella]] or naos chamber (where a statue of the god or goddess and an altar was built), and 3. the [[opisthodomos]] behind the [[cella]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Read Buildings|last=Cragoe|first=Carol Davidson|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8478-3112-8|location=New York, NY|pages= 24\u201325}}</ref> The most iconic element of Hellenistic architecture is of course the [[column]]. The [[Doric order]], sober and severe, was dominant in [[Peloponnese]] and [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Sicily]] and South Italy), being named the masculine order of Hellenistic architecture. Meanwhile, the [[Ionic order]] is graceful and more ornamented, being the feminine order. Because of Ionic's proportions, it is used especially for monumental buildings. The third of the Greek orders was also the last to be developed. The earliest documented examples of the use of the [[Corinthian order]] are (internally) at the [[Temple of Apollo Epicurius]], [[Bassae]] (429-390 BC) and (externally) at the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] (335-334 BC). Corinthian was not, like the Doric and Ionic orders, a structural system. It was purely decorative, its effect due almost wholly to its elaborate floral capital. This, according to [[Vitruvius]], was designed by the Athenian sculptor [[Callimachus]], and may originally have been worked in bronze. Apart from this capital, all the constituent parts were borrowed from the Ionic order. Gradually, in Hellenistic times (after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC), Corinthian did begin to develop, but it was left to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to blend the elements together and make it perfect.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=102|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Parthenon (30276156187).jpg|[[Doric order|Doric]]: The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]], built of marble and limestone between circa 460-406 BC, dedicated to the goddess Athena<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mattinson|first1=Lindsay|title=Understanding Architecture A Guide To Architectural Styles|date=2019|publisher=Amber Books|isbn=978-1-78274-748-2|page=21|url=|language=en}}</ref>\nFile:Illustration of the Doric order, from 1697, by Vincenzo Scamozzi.jpg|Page with illustration of the Doric order, made by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] in 1697\nFile:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Doric Entablature MET DP870189.jpg|Engraving of a Doric [[entablature]], from 1536, by [[Agostino Veneziano]], in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Temple of Athena Nik\u00e8 from Propylaea, Acropolis, Athens, Greece.jpg|[[Ionic order|Ionic]]: The [[Temple of Athena Nike]] on the Athenian Acropolis, dedicated to the goddess Athena, built between circa 437 BC and 432 BC<ref>{{cite book |last1=Michalowski|first1=Kazimierz|title=Cum \u0219i-au creat grecii arta|date=1975|publisher=Editura Meridiane|isbn=|page=228|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\nFile:Illustration of the Ionic order, from 1697, by Vincenzo Scamozzi.jpg|Page with illustration of the Ionic order, made by Vincenzo Scamozzi in 1697\nFile:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Ionic Entablature MET DP870178.jpg|Engraving of an Ionic entablature, from 1528, by Agostino Veneziano, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:L'Olympieion (Ath\u00e8nes) (30776483926).jpg|[[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]: The [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] in Athens, started in the 6th century BC and finished in the 2nd century AD\nFile:Illustration of the Corinthian order, from 1697, by Vincenzo Scamozzi.jpg|Page with illustration of the Corinthian order, made by Vincenzo Scamozzi in 1697\nFile:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Corinthian Entablature MET DP870179.jpg|Engraving of a Corinthian entablature, from 1528, by Agostino Veneziano, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:Caryatids from the Erechtheion on the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Athens (13889706087).jpg|[[Caryatide|Caryatids]] of the [[Erechtheion]] from the Athenian Acropolis, exhibited in the [[Acropolis Museum]], ([[Athens]]) \nFile:Altar and statue of temple of Aesculapius at Epidaurus Wellcome L0016950.jpg|Illustration of the altar and statue of the [[Temple of Asclepius, Epidaurus|Temple of Asclepius]] ([[Epidaurus]], Greece), which shows the interior of an Ancient Greek temple\nFile:Antike Polychromie 1.jpg|Reconstructed [[polychrome|color scheme]] of the [[entablature]] on a [[Doric temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Etruscan===\n{{main|Etruscan architecture}}\n[[File:Orvieto, tempio del belvedere, antefissa 02.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture from the Tempio di Belvedere, in National Archaeological Museum of [[Orvieto]] (Italy)]]\nJust as Mycenaean architecture seems to have influenced the classical Greeks, so the structures raised by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] are important in the evolution of [[ancient Roman architecture]]. The Etruscans probably originated in [[Asia Minor]] and settled in west-central Italy ([[Etruria]]), between the rivers [[Arno]] and [[Tiber]]. From the late 7th century BC their power grew, and for a while Rome itself was ruled by Etruscan kings. But with the establishment of a republic in 509 BC, Etruscan civilization began to decline and its various city states were conquered. Nonetheless, the Etruscans did not cease their architectural activity, which retained its distinct character until the 1st century BC. Few buildings survived, but those that do are extremely fine, especially the tombs, which were located mainly in specific [[necropolis]] sites.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=90|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Etruscans, as we know from the writings of [[Vitruvius]], a Roman architect and engineer of the 1st century BC, developed a style of temple building which, though inspired by Greek and Oriental examples, was quite distinctive in its own right. It conformed to specific rules, referred to as ''tuscanicae dispositiones'' by  Vitruvius. Temples were usually of mud-brick and timber, though stone was used later, and seem to have been built to face south. They were placed at the centre of towns and fronted on to squares, in which altars were placed.<ref name=\"Architectural Details\">{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=92|url=|language=en}}</ref> Temples were lavishly decorated with painted terracotta, which served partly to protect the wooden elements of the structure.

The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity \u2013 from [[Spain|Spanish]] to [[Greece|Greek]], [[Macedon]]ian to [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] \u2013 Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ''[[ecumene]]'' presented a new challenge for justice. Roman architecture, especially [[Roman temple]] architecture, shared many basic characteristics with [[Greek temple]] architecture, including the prominent [[portico]], use of the [[Classical order]]s (mainly [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]), and the stepped podium. However, it tended to be more ornate and elaborate overall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson Cragoe|first1=Carol|title=How To Read Buildings A crash course in architecture|date=2017|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-912217-30-4|page=26|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Corinthian order was the most widely used order in Roman architecture. It differed from the Greek Corinthian in its more ornate entablature and capital, but more particularly in the introduction of [[modillion]]s (horizontal consoles that supported a deeper cornice). Sometimes [[coffer]]ing was introduced between these to create a greater impression from the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=143|url=|language=en}}</ref> Early Roman Corinthian capitals tended to be squatter than later examples, with fleshier [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves and larger flowers on the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=122|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically, we find this happening in the Roman [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus, we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by [[Julius Caesar]], where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space.\n\nAs the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman [[engineering]] and construction or the newly found marble quarries, which were the spoils of war; inventions like the [[arch]] and [[concrete]] gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut [[dome]]s and [[colonnade]]s, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity: the [[Colosseum]], the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right \n| total_width = \n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Two widely used motifs: the ''[[festoon]]s'' ([[wreath]]s or hanging, each from two points) in the first photo; and ''[[bucranium|bucrania]]'' (bull skulls), in the second photo\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = D\u00e9tail du Panth\u00e9on en mars 2014 5.jpg\n| width1 = \n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Sarcofago caffarelli con ghirlande, da roma, 40 dc ca. 06 bucranio.JPG\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nThe Romans widely employed, and further developed, the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[dome]], all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.<ref>''The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.''(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231)</ref> Their innovative use of [[Roman concrete]] facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the [[Roman empire]].

It is in their impressive aqueducts that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the [[Pont du Gard]], the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], and the remains of the [[Aqueducts of Rome]] itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Maison Carree in Nimes (16).jpg|The [[Roman Temple]]: the [[Maison Carr\u00e9e]] in [[N\u00eemes]] (France)\nFile:The Pantheon, Rome (14995115321).jpg|The [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital: Detail from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Parthenon]] (Rome)\nCapital at the Traianus Temple in Pergamon (2).JPG|The [[Composite order|Composite]] capital: Detail from the Temple of Trajan in Pergamon ([[Turkey]])\nFile:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|The Arch: The [[Colosseum]], the most iconic Roman building\nFile:Internal Pantheon Light.JPG|The Dome: Interior of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] from Rome\nOstia, horrea epagathiana 01.JPG|The [[Horreum]]: The Horrea Epagathiana et Epaphroditiana in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] (Rome)\nGariannonum Burgh Castle south wall well preserved close up.jpg|The [[Roman brick|Roman bricks]]: Close-up view of the wall of the Roman shore fort at [[Burgh Castle]] (England)\nCubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

The [[Islamic architecture]] of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.\nIran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]ns, and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.\n\nThe [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with [[Susa]] and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.\n\nWith the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.\nThe roundness of the city of [[Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid|Abbasid era]] for example, points to its Persian precedents such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].<ref>Islam Art and Architecture.

Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in domestic architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influences were manifested in the construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[monolithic church]]es of [[Lalibela]] were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as [[Adadi Maryam]] (15th century), about 100&nbsp;km south of [[Addis Abeba]]. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the eleven monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all eleven structures to the eponymous King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|Lalibela]] (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant [[David Phillipson]] postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.<ref>David Keys: [http://www.archaeology.org/0411/newsbriefs/ethiopia.html Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?]</ref>\n\nDuring the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in [[Abyssinian\u2013Adal war|its fight against Adal]], and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see [[Habesh]]), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous [[amba (geology)|amba]]s or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of [[Sarsa Dengel]] around the [[Lake Tana]] region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), [[Gondar]]. Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were [[Beta Israel]]. With the reign of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.\n\n[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture.]]\n[[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles.\n\nIn the Western [[Sahel]] region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]], with one centered on [[Friday prayer]].<ref>Historical Society of Ghana.

The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86</ref>\n\n[[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenn\u00e9]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore|Sankore Mosque]] in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]]. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with [[Hip roof|hipped roofs]] of [[Roof shingle|shingles]] or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]].\n\nA common type of houses in Sub-Saharian Africa were the [[beehive house]]s, made from a circle of stones topped with a domed roof.

It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from [[Hindu temple architecture]] to [[Islamic architecture]] to western [[classical architecture]] to [[modern architecture|modern]] and [[post-modern architecture]].\n\nIndia's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to [[Mohenjodaro]] and [[Harappa]], now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and [[civil engineering]] continued to develop, manifesting in [[temple]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as ''sthapatya-kala'', literally \"the art of constructing\".\n\n[[File:Fatehpur1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall of Private Audience at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] (India), an early example of the [[Mughal architecture|architecture of the Mughal Empire]]]]\n[[Indian rock-cut architecture]] provides the earliest complete survivals of Buddhist, [[Jain]] and Hindu temples.  The temples of [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] are well-known early examples of [[Hindu temple architecture]], when the temple was taking on its final form.  This was more or less set out in the ''[[Sulbasutras]]'',  appendices to the [[Vedas]] giving ''rules for constructing altars'', with detailed geometrical and ritual requirements. \"They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes.\"<ref>O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html ''Overview of Indian Mathematics''], School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland.</ref>  Nonetheless, there is great variety in the details and decoration of regional and period styles, for example in [[Hoysala architecture]], [[Vijayanagara architecture]] and [[Western Chalukya architecture]].\n\nDuring the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Kushan Empire]], Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], Afghanistan. Over a period of time, the ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to [[Central Asia]].\n\nThe rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan Sultanates]] and [[Mughal Empire]] led to the development of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], a style that combined Islamic influences with traditional Indian styles.\n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], a new style of architecture known as the [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic revival style]] developed, which incorporated varying degrees of Indian elements into the British style. The [[Churches and convents of Goa]] which is cast in the Indian [[Baroque]] Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Vishwanath N-MP-23.jpg|The [[Vishvanatha Temple, Khajuraho|Vishvanatha Temple]] dedicated to [[Shiva]] in [[Khajuraho]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]], India)\nFile:Madurai Meenakshi temple 2.jpg|The [[Meenakshi Temple]] from [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]], India)\nFile:Al-Amman Gopuram3.JPG|Detail of the Meenakshi Temple\nFile:Hamandir Sahib (Golden Temple).jpg|The [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]] ([[Punjab]], India)\n</gallery>\n\n===Buddhist===\n{{main|Buddhist architecture}}\n{{see also|Stupa|Dzong architecture|}}\nBuddhist religious architecture developed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Three types of structures are associated with the [[Sacral architecture|religious architecture]] of [[early Buddhism]]: monasteries ([[vih\u0101ra]]s), places to venerate relics ([[stupa]]s), and shrines or prayer halls ([[chaitya]]s, also called ''chaitya grihas''), which later came to be called temples in some places. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]).\n\nWhen Buddhism came to China, [[Buddhist architecture]] came along with it. There were many monasteries built, equalling about 45,000. These monasteries were filled with examples of Buddhist architecture, and because of this, they hold a very prominent place in Chinese architecture. One of the earliest surviving examples is the brick pagoda at the Songyue Monastery in Dengfeng County.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Cave 26, Ajanta.jpg|The ''26th Cave'', one of the [[Ajanta Caves]], from the 5th century AD\nFile:Zhengding Longxing Si 2013.08.31 15-50-10.jpg|The [[Longxing Temple]] in [[Hebei]] ([[Zhengding]], China), completed in 1052 AD\nFile:Sanchi1 N-MP-220.jpg|The Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]], India)\nFile:Kofukuji08s3200.jpg|The five-storied pagoda of [[K\u014dfuku-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] ([[Nara prefecture]], Japan), completed in 669\nFile:\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e48\u0e33\u0e04\u0e37\u0e19.JPG|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] in [[Bangkok]] (Thailand), completed in the 18th century\n</gallery>\n\n==Southeast Asia==\n{{see also|Wat}}\n\n=== Oc Eo Culture ===\nPossibly the earliest examples of South East Asian architecture are [[Hindu temple]]s excavated from Cay Thi mound of the [[\u00d3c Eo]] culture from the [[Mekong Delta]], [[Southern Vietnam]] carbon-dated between the 2nd century BC to 7th century AD and constructed using granite stone and burnt bricks.

The [[Geography of Indonesia|geographic]] position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and animistic architecture of [[Oceanic art and architecture|Oceania]]. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architectural tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. \n\nGradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century [[Indies Style]] and modern [[New Indies Style]]. The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Borobudur EastGate.JPG|The Buddhist [[Borobudur]] temple, an elaborate [[stupa]] arranged in a grand [[mandala]]\nFile:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|The [[Prambanan]] temple complex dedicated to [[Trimurti]] Hindu gods\nFile:Batak Toba House.jpg|A traditional [[Batak architecture|Batak Toba house]] in North [[Sumatra]]\nFile:House in Nias North Sumatra.jpg|A [[Omo sebua|traditional house in Nias]] (North Sumatra)\n</gallery>\n\n==Oceanic==\n{{main|Oceanic art and architecture}}\n[[File:Nan madol.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Nan Madol]] on the [[Pohnpei]] island]]\nMost Oceanic buildings consist of [[hut]]s, made of wood and other vegetal materials.

Especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang Dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.\n\nFrom the [[Neolithic]] era [[Longshan Culture]] and [[Bronze Age]] era [[Erlitou culture]], the earliest [[rammed earth]] fortifications exist, with evidence of [[timber framing|timber architecture]]. The subterranean ruins of the palace at [[Yinxu]] dates back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC&ndash;1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and was eventually influenced by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] building for housing religious [[sutra]]s \u2014 the [[stupa]] \u2014 which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]] is the [[Songyue Pagoda]], a 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in [[Henan]] province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone [[spandrel|open-spandrel]] segmental [[arch bridge]].\n\n[[File:Gugong.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Forbidden City]], an example of Chinese architecture from the 15th century]]\nThe vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] who were drafted into the government by the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]]. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065&ndash;1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.\n\nThere were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.\n\nMany current Chinese architectural designs follow [[post-modern]] and [[Western world|western]] styles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:\u592a\u548c\u95e8\u96c0\u66ff.JPG|Detail of a colorful column from a gate\nFile:Hangzhou 2009 1775.jpg|Traditional [[Chinese garden]] in [[Hangzhou]] (China)\nFile:11 Temple of Heaven.jpg|Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the main building of the [[Temple of Heaven]] (Beijing)\nFile:Zhengding Longxing Si 2013.08.31 15-50-10.jpg|The [[Longxing Temple]] in [[Hebei]] ([[Zhengding]], China), completed in 1052 AD\n</gallery>\n\n=== Korean===\n{{main|Korean architecture}}\n[[File:Donggwol-do.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Donggwoldo]], a landscape of the once extensive grounds of the [[Changdeokgung|Changdeokgung Palace]], and the [[Changgyeonggung|Changgyeonggung Palace]]]]\nThe basic construction form is more or less similar to Eastern Asian building system.  From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the {{not a typo|k'an}} unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the \"inside\" and the \"outside.\"\n\nThe console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCE\u2013668 CE)\u2014in palaces in Pyongyang, for instance\u2014a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Koryo dynasty (918\u20131392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.\n\nIn the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Daeungjeon at Bulguksa-Gyeongju-Korea-01.jpg|The [[Bulguksa]] temple in [[Gyeongju]] (South Korea)\nFile:\uacbd\uc8fc \ubd88\uad6d\uc0ac \ub2e4\ubcf4\ud0d1.jpg|The [[Dabotap|Dabo Pagoda]] in Bulguksa, built in circa 751 AD\nFile:Gyeongbokgung-GeunJeongJeon.jpg|Throne Hall of the [[Gyeongbokgung]] Palace in [[Seoul]] (South Korea)\nFile:Changdeokgung Palace, Seoul, constructd in 1405 (108) (26242969507).jpg|The [[Changdeokgung Palace]], built in 1405\n</gallery>\n\n===Japanese===\n{{Main|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Himeji Castle]] from the [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]] ([[Kansai region]])]]\nJapanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. It also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.\n\nTwo new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the [[castle]], a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the ''[[shoin]]'', a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.\n\nBecause of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern [[skyscraper]] design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New [[city planning]] ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (''oku''), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Horyu-ji, November 2016.jpg|[[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] (literally Temple of the Flourishing Law), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]] ([[Nara Prefecture]]), built in the 7th century\nFile:Kinkaku-ji the Golden Temple in Kyoto overlooking the lake - high rez.JPG|[[Kinkaku-ji]] (literally \"Temple of the Golden Pavilion\"), a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] in [[Kyoto]], originally built in 1397\nFile:Kumamoto Castle 31s4272.jpg|Interior of the [[Kumamoto Castle]] in [[Kumamoto]] ([[Kumamoto Prefecture]]), built in 1467, demolished in 1877 and rebuilt in 1960\nFile:Japan 060416 Ninnaji 02.jpg|The garden of the [[Ninna-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]] ([[Kyoto Prefecture]]), an example of a [[Japanese garden]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Pre-Columbian {{anchor|Pre-Columbian}}==\n===Mesoamerican===\n{{main|Mesoamerican architecture}}\n{{see also|Mezcala culture}}\nMesoamerican architecture is the set of architectural traditions produced by pre-Columbian cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], (such as the [[Olmecs|Olmec]], [[Maya architecture|Maya]], and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec]]) traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures outside of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Mezcala culture]] (700\u2013200 BC) is known for its temple shaped sculptures, usually with an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] person in the middle.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Stone Temple Model MET 1994.35.630.jpg|[[Mezcala culture|Mezcala]] temple model with a figure in centre, 1st\u20138th century, made of stone, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|The [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] temple [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]], also known as the Temple of [[Kukulcan]], built between 9th and 12th centuries in [[Yucat\u00e1n]] (Mexico)\nFile:Palenque ruins web.jpg|Overview of the central plaza of the Mayan city of [[Palenque]] ([[Chiapas]], Mexico), a fine example of Classic period [[Mesoamerican architecture]]\nFile:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuac\u00e1n).jpg|[[Teotihuacan]] style architecture displaying decorative ornamentation made of obsidian and shell inlaid into a painted cantera surface set upon a tezontle interior\n</gallery>\n\n===Inca===\n{{main|Inca architecture}}\nIncan architecture consists of the major construction achievements developed by the [[Incas]]. The Incas developed an extensive [[Inca road system|road system]] spanning most of the western length of the continent. [[Inca rope bridge]]s could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (It would have been impractical for the terrain) or horses, they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-[[llama]] traffic. Much of present-day architecture at the former Inca capital [[Cuzco]] shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city [[Machu Picchu]] is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|View of [[Machu Picchu]] in [[Peru]], built in circa 1450 AD\nFile:Machu Picchu - temple.jpg|The Main Temple of Machu Picchu\nFile:Cusco Piedra de los doce angulos.jpg|The [[Twelve-angled stone]], part of a stone wall of an Inca palace, and a national heritage object\nFile:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|[[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry at [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient of North America===\nInside what is the present-day United States, the Mississippians<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mississippian-culture | title = Mississippian culture | work =  Answers.com}}</ref> and the Pueblo<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482743/pueblo-architecture | title = Pueblo architecture | encyclopedia = Britannica}}</ref> created substantial public architecture.

The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-era]] architecture in Europe and, following the [[Fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]] by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, leading directly to the [[Ottoman architecture|architecture of the Ottoman Empire]].\n\nEarly Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of [[Roman architecture]]. [[Architectural style|Stylistic drift]], [[pendentive|technological advancement]], and [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|political]] and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged, which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric [[Cruciform|complexity]], brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, [[classical orders]] were used more freely, [[mosaic]]s replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and windows filtered light through thin sheets of [[alabaster]] to softly illuminate interiors. This Byzantine style, with increasingly exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, traveled west to [[Ravenna]] and [[Venice]] and as far north as [[Moscow]]. Most of the churches and basilicas have high-riding domes. As result, they created vast open spaces at the centres of churches, heightening the sense of grace and light. The round arch is a fundamental of Byzantine style. Magnificent golden mosaics with their graphic simplicity and immense power brought light and warmth into the heart of churches. Byzantine capitals break away from the Classical conventions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. Sinuous lines and naturalistic forms are precursors to the [[Gothic style]].\n\nAccording to descriptions, interiors were plated with [[marble]] or stone. Some of the columns were also made of marble. Other widely used materials were bricks and stone, not just marble like in [[Classical antiquity]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dimitriu Hurmuziadis|first1=Lucia|title=Cultura Greciei|date=1979|publisher=Editura \u0219tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i enciclopedic\u0103|isbn=|page=93|url=|language=ro}}</ref> Mural paintings or mosaics made of shiny little stones were also elements of interior architecture.

While these terms are problematic, they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era. Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s \"historicising\" and \"modernising\" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.\n\nRomanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since [[Roman architecture|Roman Imperial architecture]] and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the [[Romanesque art|art it describes]], but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, [[barrel vault]]s, and cruciform piers supporting vaults.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral Choir.jpg|Interior of the [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[Durham, England|Durham]] (England), built between 1093 and 1133, additions until 1490 \nFile:Vezelay WLM2016 La basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (3).jpg|Stone bas-relief of [[Jesus]], from the [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]] ([[Burgundy]], France)\nFile:Maria Lach 02.jpg|[[Maria Laach Abbey]], situated on the southwestern shore of the [[Laacher See]] (Lake Laach), near [[Andernach]] (Germany), built in the 11th-12th centuries\nFile:StrasbourgCath CroisN 21.JPG|Part of a stained glass window from [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg]] in [[Strasbourg]] (France)\n</gallery>\n\n====Gothic====\n{{Main|Gothic architecture}}\nThe various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th- and 12th-century building projects, particularly in the [[\u00cele de France]] area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|12th-century abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]]. Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external [[flying buttress]]es, pointed [[arch]]es using the [[ogive]] shape, [[Rib vault|ribbed vaults]], clustered columns, [[pinnacle]]s and sharply pointed [[spires]] and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]].

It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of [[Peter the Great]] (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.\n\nThe [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] is one of Russia's most distinctive sights. Built by Tsar [[Ivan IV]] (also known as Ivan the Terrible) to commemorate his defeat of the Mongols at the battle [[Kazan]] in 1552, it stands just outside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in the [[Red Square]], in the heart of [[Moscow]]. Its extraordinary [[Onion dome|onion-shaped domes]], painted in bright colours, create a memorable skyline, making St. Basil's Cathedral a symbol both of Moscow and Russia as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson|first1=Philip|title=Great Buildings|date=2017|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK]]|isbn=978-0-2412-9883-1|page=121|url=|language=en}}</ref> Each of the domes has its own dazzling form of decoration, ranging from prisms and spirals to chevrons and stripes, all emphasised with brilliant colours.

This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts.\n\n[[File:Amsterdam, straatzicht Oudezijds Voorburgwal foto1 2014-01-12 13.42.jpg|thumb|Houses of this type were built between about 1600 and 1665, examples of Dutch Renaissance architecture]]\nThe development from [[Medieval architecture]] concerned the way [[geometry]] mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in [[Renaissance art]], and helped shape new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist thought]].\n\nPerspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to ''describing'' experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality.\n<!--should this be kept?:\n[[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Cortile del Belvedere]] project is one such instance where spaces were pictured/designed together before being built. Such a space was only possible due to the powers of abstraction, offered by perspective, that allowed the composition of heterogeneous activities into a metaphor for the legitimacy of current rule. The commission was set by [[Pope Julius II]] to connect an ancient pontifical palace on the right of St Peter's with the palace, built by Pollaiolo for Innocent VIII. In doing so Bramante organised the ascent through three courts that sees the lower, theatrical level move into the upper level through increasingly planned gardens thereby creating a tension between the human realm and an idealised vision of the \"ideal city\", Jerusalem, this is explicitly shown in Bramante's depiction of the ascent from the perspective of Pope Julius's bedroom window.-->\n\nThe Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], and the style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515\u201347). (See [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]). The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]], who was engaged after 1540 in work at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].\n\nArchitects such as [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Giacomo Vignola]], and [[Pierre Lescot]], were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the [[Cour Carr\u00e9e]] of the [[Louvre]] in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by [[Jean Goujon]]. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].\n\nIn England, the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573\u20131652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of [[Andrea Palladio]] was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and [[turret]]s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:View of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.jpg|The [[Florence Cathedral]], built between 1296 and 1436 in [[Florence]] (Italy)\n\nH\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin.jpg|The [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] in [[Toulouse]] (France), an example of a 16th-century [[h\u00f4tel particulier]]\n\nFenetre-vieux-raisin (2).jpg|Double window of the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, decorated with a [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it, an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column in the middle, and [[caryatid]]s at its edges\n\nRaisin-medaillon-3.jpg|Medallion and a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] pilaster's capital, on H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin\n\nDetail 1 h\u00f4tel du Vieux raisin.JPG|Various ornaments widely used in Renaissance [[applied arts]], including [[putto|putti]] and [[festoon|festoons]], on a wall of the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin\n\nFenetre-assezat-cour (2).jpg|[[Cross-window]] from [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], with a round and broken [[pediment]] above it\n\nFile:Castle of Chenonceau 33.jpg|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], built between 1514 and 1522 in France\n\nSalon of Francis I of France in the Castle of Chenonceau.jpg|The fireplace from the Salon of [[Francis I of France]], in Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau\n</gallery>\n\n==European and colonial architecture==\n{{main|Colonial architecture}}\nWith the rise of various European [[colonial empire]]s from the 16th century onward through the early 20th century, the new stylistic trends of Europe were exported to or adopted by locations around the world, often evolving into new regional variations.\n\n===Baroque===\n{{Main|Baroque architecture}}\n[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]] (Austria), built between 1716 and 1737]]\n\nThe [[Baroque]] and its late variant the [[Rococo]] were the first truly global styles in the arts. Dominating more than two centuries of art and architecture in Europe, Latin America and beyond from circa 1580 to circa 1800, they were the first to focus so intensely on their impact on the viewer, and they owed much of their popularity and global scope to this visual allure. Born in the painting studios of [[Bologna]] and [[Rome]] in the 1580s and 1590s, and in Roman sculptural and architectural ateliers in the second and third decades of the 17th century, the Baroque spread swiftly throughout [[Italian Baroque architecture|Italy]], [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spain]] and [[Baroque architecture in Portugal|Portugal]], Flanders, [[French Baroque architecture|France]], the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as to central and eastern European centres from [[Munich]] (Germany) to [[Vilnius]] ([[Lithuania]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Gauvin Alexander|title=Baroque & Rococo|date=2012|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978-0-7148-5742-8|page=24 & 4|url=|language=en}}</ref> \n\nBaroque architecture originated in 17th century [[Rome]], where it developed as an expression on the newly triumphant [[Catholic Church]].

The interior effects were often achieved with the use of ''[[quadratura]]'',  or ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'' painting combined with sculpture: the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling.  Light was also used for dramatic effect;  it streamed down from cupolas and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. [[Solomonic column]]s were often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.<ref>Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102</ref> A characteristically Baroque form of ornamentation, the [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] is an oval panel with crested or scrolled borders, used on palace, house and church fa\u00e7ades as a framing device for a [[monogram]] (of the owner, the architect or the person to whom it is dedicated), cresting or coat of arms, but also as a purely decorative infill motif.

Although the style originated in the rich decoration at the [[Palace of Versailles]], it was also a reaction to the formality of the royal palace. [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]], [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], [[Nicolas Pineau]] and [[Germain Boffrand]] were among the designers who succeeded in reflecting the more intimate scale and comfortable arrangement of rooms by decorating them with light, frivolous and colourful schemes in which panels and door-frames dissolved and walls merged with the ceiling. The repertoire of motifs, including [[Rocaille]] [[arabesque]]s and [[chinoiserie]]s, was infinitely varied. Characteristic of the style were Rocaille motifs derived from the shells, icicles and rockwork or grotto decoration. Rocaille arabesques were mostly abstract forms, laid out symmetrically over and around architectural frames. A favourite motif was the scallop shell, whose top scrolls echoed the basic S and C framework scrolls of the arabesques and whose sinuous ridges echoed the general curvilinearity of the room decoration. While few Rococo exteriors were built in France, a number of Rococo churches are found in southern Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=270|url=|language=en}}</ref> Other widely-user motifs in decorative arts and interior architecture include: asymmetrical shells, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, angels and [[Chinoiserie|Far Eastern elements]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=193 & 194|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\nRococo features exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}\n\nThe style often integrated painting, molded stucco and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where [[Putto|putti]] and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included stucco, either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze.

This [[Palladian architecture]] and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque, informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the [[Grand Tour]], coupled with the excavations of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].\n\nThe shift to [[Neoclassical architecture]] is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]'s excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and [[Robert Adam]], was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. \n\nThe style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. [[Federal architecture|Federal-style architecture]] is the name for the classicizing architecture built in [[North America]] between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815.  This style shares its name with its era, the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]]. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Regency style]] in Britain and to the French [[Empire style]]. In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Klassizismus}}, {{lang-ru|\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0437\u043c}}), while the newer [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revival styles]] of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Paris - Palais du Louvre - PA00085992 - 2015 - 004.jpg|Extraordinary detail of a ceiling from the [[Galerie d'Apollon]] (part of the [[Louvre]]), completed between 1766 and 1781\nFile:Grand escalier de l'op\u00e9ra de Bordeaux.jpg|Stairway of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Theater of Bordeaux]], by [[Victor Louis]], built in 1780\nFile:Compi\u00e8gne (60), palais, salon Bleu 3.jpg|The Blue Salon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] from [[Compi\u00e8gne]] (France), an example of an [[Empire style|Empire]] interior\nFile:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia), completed 1858, an example of [[Greek Revival architecture]]\nFile:Akademie von Athen.jpg|The [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], designed as part of an architectural \"trilogy\" in 1859 by the Danish architect [[Theophil Hansen]], along with the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University]] and the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]]\nFile:Fantana cantacuzino.JPG|The Cantacuzino fountain from [[Bucharest]] (Romania), finished in 1870\nFile:\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043c. \u0410.\u041b. \u0428\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430-7.jpg|Interior of the [[Stieglitz Museum of Applied Arts]] in [[Sankt Petersburg]] (Russia), built between 1885 and 1896\nFile:Bucuresti, Romania.

The work of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] in Brussels, [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] in Barcelona, [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new. \n\nArt Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration: either [[ornament (art)|ornament]]al (based on flowers and plants, e.g. thistles,<ref>[http://art.nouveau.world/thistle Thistle - Art Nouveau World]</ref> irises,<ref>[http://art.nouveau.world/iris Iris - Art Nouveau World]</ref> cyclamens, orchids, water lilies, etc.) or sculptural (see the [[Art Nouveau#Sculpture|respective section]] below). While faces of people (or [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]]s) are referred to ornament, the use of people in different forms of sculpture (statues and reliefs: see the [[Art Nouveau#Sculpture|respective section]] below) were also typical for Art Nouveau. Before [[Vienna Secession]], [[Jugendstil]] and [[National romantic style]] fa\u00e7ades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome [[ceramic tile]]s. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111</ref> The [[Whiplash (decorative art)|whiplash motif]], adapted from vegetal forms, was widely used.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Tassel House stairway.JPG|Interior of the [[H\u00f4tel Tassel]] built between 1892 and 1893 by [[Victor Horta]], in [[Bruxelles]] (Belgium)\n\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|Entrance of the [[Castel B\u00e9ranger]] in Paris, by [[Hector Guimard]]\n\nFile:Hotel Dacia, Satu Mare Romania 1.JPG|The [[Dacia Hotel]] built in 1902, in [[Satu Mare]] ([[Romania]])\n\nFile:Casa Batllo Overview Barcelona Spain cut.jpg|The [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] in [[Barcelona]] (Spain), an iconic Art Nouveau masterpiece\n\nXDSC 7288-29-av-Rapp-paris-7.jpg|Highly decorated door in Paris, at the entrance of the [[Lavirotte Building]]\n\nPhotograph, Dining Room, H\u00f4tel Guimard, Rue Mozart, Paris, ca. 1910 (CH 18411061).jpg|Dining Room of the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard]], about 1910\n\nTimisoara Cartierul Iosefin (1).JPG|Detail of a 1910 building, with a female [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]], in [[Timi\u0219oara]] (Romania)\n\nAntwerpen Jugendstil Waterloostraat Herfst, Winter, Zomer en Lente 10.jpg|[[Mosaic]] representing summer, on a house from [[Antwerp]] ([[Belgium]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Modern===\n{{Further|Modern architecture}}\n<!--[[File:Falling Water 01.jpg|thumb]]-->\n\nEarly Modern architecture began with a number of building styles with similar characteristics, primarily the simplification of form and the elimination of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], that first arose around 1900. By the 1940s these styles had largely consolidated and been identified as the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]].\n\nThe exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate. An important trigger appears to have been the [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] credited to [[Louis Sullivan]]: \"[[form follows function]]\". [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in architecture, is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].\n\n===Expressionist===\n[[File:Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|[[Goetheanum]] by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1923]]\n{{Main|Expressionist architecture}}\n\nExpressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts.\n\nThe style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural [[Biomorphism|biomorphic]] forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in [[World War I]] and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.<ref>Jencks, p.59</ref> Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,<ref>Sharp, p.68</ref> resulting in many of the most important Expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Casa Nova. Zukunftsarchitektur - Formenspiel und Feinbau''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the Expressionist imagination,<ref>Pehnt, p.163</ref> and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate.\n\n===Art Deco===\n{{main|Art Deco|Streamline Moderne}}\n[[File:Chrysler Building spire, Manhattan, by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04444).jpg|thumb|right|140px|The [[Art Deco]] [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]] (1930)]]\nThe [[Art Deco]] style in architecture emerged in Paris just before [[World War I]] with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] by [[Auguste Perret]] (1911\u20131913) and the Majorelle Building by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1913). Its revolutionary use of reinforced concrete, geometric forms, straight lines, and decorative sculpture applied to the outside of the building in plaques of marble, ceramics and stucco, and later in stainless steel, were a departure from [[Art Nouveau]].  The style reached its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, and took its name from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] in Paris in 1925.  \n\nArt Deco became especially popular in the United States in the late 1920s, where the style was used for [[skyscrapers]] including the [[Chrysler Building]] (1930) and [[Empire State Building]] (1931), and for lavish motion picture palaces including [[Radio City Music Hall]] (1932) in [[New York City]] and the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in [[Oakland, California]].  In the 1930s a stripped-down variation called [[Streamline Moderne]] emerged, which was inspired by the curving aerodynamic forms of ocean liners, airplanes and trains.  Art Deco was used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations and movie theaters around the world in the 1930s, but declined rapidly at the end of the decade due to the [[Great Depression]] and intense criticism of the style by modernist architects such as [[Le Corbusier]], who denounced what he felt was its excessive ornament. By 1939, the style was largely out of fashion and was replaced by the more austere [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=175-206}}\n\n===International Style===\n[[File:Glaspaleis front-east.jpg|thumb|The [[Glaspaleis|Glass Palace]], a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, The Netherlands (1935)]]\n{{Main|International Style (architecture)}}\n\nThe International style was a major [[architectural style|architectural trend]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before World War II. The term had its origin from the name of a book by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]] which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the International Style thus constitute part of [[modernism]].\n\nThe ideas of Modernism were developed especially in what was taught at the German [[Bauhaus]] School in [[Weimar]] (from 1919), [[Dessau]] (between 1926\u201332) and finally [[Berlin]] between 1932\u201333, under the leadership first of its founder [[Walter Gropius]], then [[Hannes Meyer]], and finally [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Modernist theory in architecture resided in the attempt to bypass the question of what [[Architectural style|style]] a building should be built in, a concern that had overshadowed 19th-century architecture, and the wish to reduce form to its most minimal expression of structure and function. In the United States, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] treated this new phenomenon in 1931 as if it represented a new style \u2013 the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]], thereby misrepresenting its primary mission as merely a matter of eliminating traditional [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]. The core effort to pursue Modern architecture as an abstract, scientific programme was more faithfully carried forward in [[Europe]], but issues of style always overshadowed its stricter and more puritan goals, not least in the work of [[Le Corbusier]]. \n<!--Brutalism-->\n<!--Mid-Century Modern-->\n<!--High Tech-->\n<!--Structuralism-->\n\n===Contemporary===\n[[File:Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology, Krakow, Poland.jpg|thumb|Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in [[Cracow]], Poland, by [[Arata Isozaki]] and Krzysztof Ingarden (1994)]]\n\n{{main|Contemporary architecture}}\n\n===Modern===\n{{Main|Modern architecture}}\nModern architecture is generally characterized by simplification of form and creation of ornament from the structure and theme of the building.

In a broader sense, modern architecture began at the turn of the 20th century with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the [[modernization]] of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.<ref name=GEMbook />\n\n===Critical regionalism===\n[[File:Sydney Opera House Sails.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sydney Opera House]], designed to evoke the sails of yachts in Sydney harbour]]\n{{Main|Critical regionalism}}\n\nCritical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in [[Modern architecture]] by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]] and later more famously by [[Kenneth Frampton]].\n\nFrampton put forth his views in \"Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance.\" He evokes [[Paul Ric\u0153ur]]'s question of \"how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization\". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] to supplement his arguments.\n\n===Postmodern===\n{{Main|Postmodern architecture}}\n[[File:1000-de-la-gauchetiere.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]], with ornamented and strongly defined top, middle and bottom. Contrast with the modernist [[Seagram Building]] and [[Torre Picasso]].]]\nPostmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. [[Postmodernity]] in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of \"wit, ornament and reference\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] and formalized shapes and spaces of the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse [[aesthetics]]: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.\n\nClassic examples of [[modern architecture]] are the [[Lever House]] and the [[Seagram Building]] in commercial space, and the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or the [[Bauhaus]] movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the [[Portland Building]] in [[Portland, OR|Portland]] and the [[Sony Building (New York City)]] (originally AT&T Building) in New York City, which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which was studied by [[Robert Venturi]] in his 1972 book ''Learning from Las Vegas'' celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that \"Less is a bore\", inverting [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s dictum that \"Less is more\".\n\nFollowing the postmodern movement, a renaissance of pre-modernist urban and architectural ideals established itself, with [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] being prominent movements.\n\n===Deconstructivist===\n[[File:Imperial War Museum North, Old Trafford, Manchester - geograph.org.uk - 1660068.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Manchester]] comprises three apparently intersecting curved volumes.]]\n{{Main|Deconstructivism}}\n\nDeconstructivism in architecture is a development of [[postmodern architecture]] that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent [[non-Euclidean geometry]],<ref>Husserl, ''Origins of Geometry'', Introduction by Jacques Derrida</ref> (i.e., non-[[rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]], such as structure and [[building envelope|envelope]]. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist \"styles\" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos.\n\nImportant events in the history of the Deconstructivist movement include the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]] (especially the entry from the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] and the American architect [[Peter Eisenman]]<ref>Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997)</ref> and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s winning entry), the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]], and the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]]'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] (USA), opened in 2006]]\n\n==The 21st century==\n{{further|2000 in architecture}}\nOn January 21, 2013 architects began preparations for constructing the world's first [[3D printing|3D-printed]] building.

Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling the creation of faithful reconstructions, they seldom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] rites and art.\n\nIn South and Southwest Asia, Neolithic [[Archaeological culture|cultures]] appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the [[K\u0151r\u00f6s culture|Star\u010devo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vin\u010da]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Copper Complex: North America's First Miners & Metal Artisans|url=http://copperculture.homestead.com/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jeeun|title=The History of Metallurgy and Mining in the Andean Region|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/1011/pope/sje2.html|website=World History at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=Pre-Incan Metallurgy Discovered|url=http://www.livescience.com/1442-pre-incan-metallurgy-discovered.html|website=Live Science|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado|first1=Blanco D.|title=Tarascan Copper Metallurgy at the Site of Itzipar\u00e1tzico, Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico|journal=Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies|date=2003|url=http://www.famsi.org/reports/02063/02063Maldonado01.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNeolithic [[List of archaeological sites|settlements and \"cities\"]] include:\n* [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]] in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC\n* [[Jericho]] in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier [[Epipaleolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]\n* [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC\n* [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Turkey]], 7,500 BC\n* [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Pakistan]], 7,000 BC\n* [[Knap of Howar]] and [[Skara Brae]], the [[Orkney Islands]], [[Prehistoric Scotland|Scotland]], from 3,500 BC\n* over 3,000 settlements of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present-day [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] from 5,400\u20132,800 BC.\n\nThe Neolithic people in the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Central Asia]] were great builders, utilizing [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The Mediterranean Neolithic cultures of [[Malta]] worshiped in [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]].\n\nIn Europe, [[Neolithic long house|long houses]] built from [[wattle and daub]] were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousands still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s flint mines and [[cursus]] monuments.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Urfa.jpg|''[[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]'' in [[Turkey]], founded in 10th millennium BC and abandoned in 8th millennium BC\nFile:Trypillian house2.jpg|Pottery miniature of a [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian]] house\nFile:Cucuteni MNIR IMG 7622.JPG|Miniature of a regular Cucuteni-Trypillian house, full of ceramic vessels\nFile:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]] ([[Mainland, Orkney]], [[Scotland]], UK)\n</gallery>\n\n==Antiquity==\n\n===Ancient Mesopotamia===\n{{Main|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}\nAncient [[Mesopotamia]] is most noted for its construction of mud brick buildings and the construction of [[ziggurat]]s, occupying a prominent place in each city and consisting of an artificial mound, often rising in huge steps, surmounted by a temple. The mound was no doubt to elevate the temple to a commanding position in what was otherwise a flat river valley. The great city of [[Uruk]] had a number of religious precincts, containing many temples larger and more ambitious than any buildings previously known.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risebero|first1=Bill|title=The Story of Western Architecture|date=2018|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-3500-9212-9|page=13|url=|language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe word ''ziggurat'' is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ''ziqqurratum'', the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb ''zaqaru'', (\"to be high\"). The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]], excavated by [[Leonard Woolley]], is 64 by 46 meters at base and originally some 12 meters in height with three stories. It was built under [[Ur-Nammu]] (circa 2100 B.C.) and rebuilt under [[Nabonidus]] (555\u2013539 B.C.), when it was increased in height to probably seven stories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg22/home.html|website=Mesopotamia.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> \n\nAssyrian palaces had a large public court with a suite of apartments on the east side and a series of large banqueting halls on the south side.

[[Harvest]]s for example were seen as the benevolence of [[fertility]] deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the city and her most important buildings (the [[palace]] and [[temple]]) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by [[rituals]] intended to enter human activity into continued divine [[benediction]].\n\nAncient architecture is characterized by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of nature outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the gods. The architect, be he [[priest]] or [[monarch|king]], was not the sole important figure, he was merely part of a continuing tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|A view of the pyramids at Giza.

Minoan buildings often had flat, tiled roofs; [[plaster]], wood or [[flagstone]] floors, and stood two to three stories high. Lower [[wall]]s were typically constructed of stone and [[rubble]], and the upper walls of [[mudbrick]]. Ceiling timbers held up the roofs. The main colors used in Minoan frescos were black ([[carbonaceous shale]]), white ([[hydrate]] of lime), red ([[hematite]]), yellow ([[ochre]]), blue ([[silicate of cooper]]) and green (yellow and blue mixed together). The most iconic Minoan building is the [[Palace of Knossos]], being connected to the mythological story of [[Minotaur|The Bull of Minos]], since it is in this palace where it was written that the labyrinth existed.\n\n[[File:Lions-Gate-Mycenae.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]], built in circa 1250 BC, an iconic Mycenaean building]]\nA common characteristic of the Minoan architecture were [[flat roof]]s. The rooms of villas didn't have windows to the streets, the light arriving from courtyards. In the 2nd millennium BC, the villas had one or two floors, and the palaces even three. One of the most notable Minoan contributions to architecture is their inverted column, wider at the top than the base (unlike most Greek columns, which are wider at the bottom to give an impression of height). The columns were made of wood (not stone) and were generally painted red. Mounted on a simple stone base, they were topped with a pillow-like, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]].<ref>Benton and DiYanni 1998, p. 67.</ref><ref>Bourbon 1998, p 34</ref>\n\n[[Aegean art]] reached its peak in circa 1650-1450 BC and was at first dominated by the Minoans. However, at the height of its influence, the Minoan civilization fell and its position was quickly inherited by the [[Mycenaean civilization|Mycenaeans]], a race of warriors who flourished in Greece from 1600 to 1200 BC. Although Cretan artisans may have been employed on the reworking of Mycenaean citadels, the two styles remained distinct. Mycenaean buildings were carefully planned and focused on the [[megaron]] (central unit), while the Minoans favoured complex, labyrinthine forms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=86|url=|language=en}}</ref>  Mycenaean columns, like the Minoan examples, were slender and tapered sharply downwords.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=89|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Minoan Room (35142219872).jpg|Queen's Megaron from the [[Palace of Knossos]], with the Dolphin fresco.

Civic life gained importance for all members of the community. In the time of the ancients religious matters were only handled by the ruling class; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or ''[[polis]]''. Ancient Greek architecture was fundamentally a representation of timber [[post and lintel]], or \"trabeated\" construction in stone, and most surviving buildings are temples. Rows of tall columns supported a [[lintel]], which in turn supported a pitched roof structure running the length of the building. The triangular [[gable]] formed at either end of the pitched roof was often heavily decorated and was a key feature of the style. Today we think of Classical and Hellenist Greek architecture as being characterized by the use of plain white marble, but originally it would have been brightly painted in gaudy colors. For example, [[Doric order]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s were painted with geometric and leaf patterns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson Cragoe|first1=Carol|title=How To Read Buildings A crash course in architecture|date=2017|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-912217-30-4|page=24 & 25|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of [[Doric order|Doric]] (left three), [[Ionic order|Ionic]] (middle three) and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] (right two) columns]]\nGreek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the ''[[agora]]'', which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The ''agora'' embodied the newfound respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the [[acropolis]] for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens.\n\nGreek architecture was typically made of stone. Most surviving buildings are temples, based on strict rules of proportion. These temples typically included a [[peristyle]] (outer area with (typically Doric) columns), and three-sections in the middle, being 1. the [[Pronaos|pronaus]] (entrance), 2. the main [[cella]] or naos chamber (where a statue of the god or goddess and an altar was built), and 3. the [[opisthodomos]] behind the [[cella]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Read Buildings|last=Cragoe|first=Carol Davidson|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8478-3112-8|location=New York, NY|pages= 24\u201325}}</ref> The most iconic element of Hellenistic architecture is of course the [[column]]. The [[Doric order]], sober and severe, was dominant in [[Peloponnese]] and [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Sicily]] and South Italy), being named the masculine order of Hellenistic architecture. Meanwhile, the [[Ionic order]] is graceful and more ornamented, being the feminine order. Because of Ionic's proportions, it is used especially for monumental buildings. The third of the Greek orders was also the last to be developed. The earliest documented examples of the use of the [[Corinthian order]] are (internally) at the [[Temple of Apollo Epicurius]], [[Bassae]] (429-390 BC) and (externally) at the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] (335-334 BC). Corinthian was not, like the Doric and Ionic orders, a structural system. It was purely decorative, its effect due almost wholly to its elaborate floral capital. This, according to [[Vitruvius]], was designed by the Athenian sculptor [[Callimachus]], and may originally have been worked in bronze. Apart from this capital, all the constituent parts were borrowed from the Ionic order.

The Etruscans probably originated in [[Asia Minor]] and settled in west-central Italy ([[Etruria]]), between the rivers [[Arno]] and [[Tiber]]. From the late 7th century BC their power grew, and for a while Rome itself was ruled by Etruscan kings. But with the establishment of a republic in 509 BC, Etruscan civilization began to decline and its various city states were conquered. Nonetheless, the Etruscans did not cease their architectural activity, which retained its distinct character until the 1st century BC. Few buildings survived, but those that do are extremely fine, especially the tombs, which were located mainly in specific [[necropolis]] sites.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=90|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Etruscans, as we know from the writings of [[Vitruvius]], a Roman architect and engineer of the 1st century BC, developed a style of temple building which, though inspired by Greek and Oriental examples, was quite distinctive in its own right. It conformed to specific rules, referred to as ''tuscanicae dispositiones'' by  Vitruvius. Temples were usually of mud-brick and timber, though stone was used later, and seem to have been built to face south. They were placed at the centre of towns and fronted on to squares, in which altars were placed.<ref name=\"Architectural Details\">{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=92|url=|language=en}}</ref> Temples were lavishly decorated with painted terracotta, which served partly to protect the wooden elements of the structure.

The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity \u2013 from [[Spain|Spanish]] to [[Greece|Greek]], [[Macedon]]ian to [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] \u2013 Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ''[[ecumene]]'' presented a new challenge for justice. Roman architecture, especially [[Roman temple]] architecture, shared many basic characteristics with [[Greek temple]] architecture, including the prominent [[portico]], use of the [[Classical order]]s (mainly [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]), and the stepped podium. However, it tended to be more ornate and elaborate overall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson Cragoe|first1=Carol|title=How To Read Buildings A crash course in architecture|date=2017|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-912217-30-4|page=26|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Corinthian order was the most widely used order in Roman architecture. It differed from the Greek Corinthian in its more ornate entablature and capital, but more particularly in the introduction of [[modillion]]s (horizontal consoles that supported a deeper cornice). Sometimes [[coffer]]ing was introduced between these to create a greater impression from the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=143|url=|language=en}}</ref> Early Roman Corinthian capitals tended to be squatter than later examples, with fleshier [[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves and larger flowers on the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=122|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically, we find this happening in the Roman [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus, we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by [[Julius Caesar]], where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space.\n\nAs the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman [[engineering]] and construction or the newly found marble quarries, which were the spoils of war; inventions like the [[arch]] and [[concrete]] gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut [[dome]]s and [[colonnade]]s, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity: the [[Colosseum]], the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right \n| total_width = \n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Two widely used motifs: the ''[[festoon]]s'' ([[wreath]]s or hanging, each from two points) in the first photo; and ''[[bucranium|bucrania]]'' (bull skulls), in the second photo\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = D\u00e9tail du Panth\u00e9on en mars 2014 5.jpg\n| width1 = \n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Sarcofago caffarelli con ghirlande, da roma, 40 dc ca. 06 bucranio.JPG\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nThe Romans widely employed, and further developed, the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[dome]], all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.<ref>''The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.''(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231)</ref> Their innovative use of [[Roman concrete]] facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the [[Roman empire]].

It is in their impressive aqueducts that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the [[Pont du Gard]], the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], and the remains of the [[Aqueducts of Rome]] itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Maison Carree in Nimes (16).jpg|The [[Roman Temple]]: the [[Maison Carr\u00e9e]] in [[N\u00eemes]] (France)\nFile:The Pantheon, Rome (14995115321).jpg|The [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital: Detail from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Parthenon]] (Rome)\nCapital at the Traianus Temple in Pergamon (2).JPG|The [[Composite order|Composite]] capital: Detail from the Temple of Trajan in Pergamon ([[Turkey]])\nFile:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|The Arch: The [[Colosseum]], the most iconic Roman building\nFile:Internal Pantheon Light.JPG|The Dome: Interior of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] from Rome\nOstia, horrea epagathiana 01.JPG|The [[Horreum]]: The Horrea Epagathiana et Epaphroditiana in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] (Rome)\nGariannonum Burgh Castle south wall well preserved close up.jpg|The [[Roman brick|Roman bricks]]: Close-up view of the wall of the Roman shore fort at [[Burgh Castle]] (England)\nCubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

The [[Islamic architecture]] of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.\nIran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]ns, and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.\n\nThe [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with [[Susa]] and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.\n\nWith the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.\nThe roundness of the city of [[Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid|Abbasid era]] for example, points to its Persian precedents such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].<ref>Islam Art and Architecture.

Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in domestic architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influences were manifested in the construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[monolithic church]]es of [[Lalibela]] were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as [[Adadi Maryam]] (15th century), about 100&nbsp;km south of [[Addis Abeba]]. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the eleven monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all eleven structures to the eponymous King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|Lalibela]] (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant [[David Phillipson]] postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.<ref>David Keys: [http://www.archaeology.org/0411/newsbriefs/ethiopia.html Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?]</ref>\n\nDuring the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in [[Abyssinian\u2013Adal war|its fight against Adal]], and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see [[Habesh]]), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous [[amba (geology)|amba]]s or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of [[Sarsa Dengel]] around the [[Lake Tana]] region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), [[Gondar]]. Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were [[Beta Israel]]. With the reign of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.\n\n[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture.]]\n[[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles.\n\nIn the Western [[Sahel]] region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]], with one centered on [[Friday prayer]].<ref>Historical Society of Ghana.

The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86</ref>\n\n[[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenn\u00e9]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore|Sankore Mosque]] in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]]. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with [[Hip roof|hipped roofs]] of [[Roof shingle|shingles]] or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]].\n\nA common type of houses in Sub-Saharian Africa were the [[beehive house]]s, made from a circle of stones topped with a domed roof. The ancient [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] used this type of house, which was made with mud, poles, and [[cow dung]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Koussoukoingou2.jpg|A traditional tata-somba house in [[Benin]]\nFile:King's palace in Nyanza.jpg|King's palace in [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]] ([[Rwanda]])\nFile:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|Illustration from 1854 of Lunda street and houses\nFile:DogonVillage.jpg|A [[Dogon people|Dogon]] village in [[Mali]], with walls made in the [[wattle and daub]] method\n</gallery>\n\n==Southern Asia==\n<!--see UN definition of Southern Asia; the two below have been clustered due to the heavy influence of Persian architecture on India, as per content of said pages-->\n\n===Indian===\n[[File:Chennakesava Temple Belur.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Chennakesava Temple]] from [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] ([[Karnataka]], India)]]\n{{Main|Indian architecture}}\n{{further|Harappan architecture|Indo-Islamic architecture}}\nIndian architecture encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from [[Hindu temple architecture]] to [[Islamic architecture]] to western [[classical architecture]] to [[modern architecture|modern]] and [[post-modern architecture]].\n\nIndia's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to [[Mohenjodaro]] and [[Harappa]], now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and [[civil engineering]] continued to develop, manifesting in [[temple]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as ''sthapatya-kala'', literally \"the art of constructing\".\n\n[[File:Fatehpur1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall of Private Audience at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] (India), an early example of the [[Mughal architecture|architecture of the Mughal Empire]]]]\n[[Indian rock-cut architecture]] provides the earliest complete survivals of Buddhist, [[Jain]] and Hindu temples.  The temples of [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] are well-known early examples of [[Hindu temple architecture]], when the temple was taking on its final form.  This was more or less set out in the ''[[Sulbasutras]]'',  appendices to the [[Vedas]] giving ''rules for constructing altars'', with detailed geometrical and ritual requirements. \"They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes.\"<ref>O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html ''Overview of Indian Mathematics''], School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland.</ref>  Nonetheless, there is great variety in the details and decoration of regional and period styles, for example in [[Hoysala architecture]], [[Vijayanagara architecture]] and [[Western Chalukya architecture]].\n\nDuring the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Kushan Empire]], Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], Afghanistan. Over a period of time, the ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to [[Central Asia]].\n\nThe rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan Sultanates]] and [[Mughal Empire]] led to the development of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], a style that combined Islamic influences with traditional Indian styles.\n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], a new style of architecture known as the [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic revival style]] developed, which incorporated varying degrees of Indian elements into the British style. The [[Churches and convents of Goa]] which is cast in the Indian [[Baroque]] Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Vishwanath N-MP-23.jpg|The [[Vishvanatha Temple, Khajuraho|Vishvanatha Temple]] dedicated to [[Shiva]] in [[Khajuraho]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]], India)\nFile:Madurai Meenakshi temple 2.jpg|The [[Meenakshi Temple]] from [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]], India)\nFile:Al-Amman Gopuram3.JPG|Detail of the Meenakshi Temple\nFile:Hamandir Sahib (Golden Temple).jpg|The [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]] ([[Punjab]], India)\n</gallery>\n\n===Buddhist===\n{{main|Buddhist architecture}}\n{{see also|Stupa|Dzong architecture|}}\nBuddhist religious architecture developed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Three types of structures are associated with the [[Sacral architecture|religious architecture]] of [[early Buddhism]]: monasteries ([[vih\u0101ra]]s), places to venerate relics ([[stupa]]s), and shrines or prayer halls ([[chaitya]]s, also called ''chaitya grihas''), which later came to be called temples in some places. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]).\n\nWhen Buddhism came to China, [[Buddhist architecture]] came along with it. There were many monasteries built, equalling about 45,000. These monasteries were filled with examples of Buddhist architecture, and because of this, they hold a very prominent place in Chinese architecture. One of the earliest surviving examples is the brick pagoda at the Songyue Monastery in Dengfeng County.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Cave 26, Ajanta.jpg|The ''26th Cave'', one of the [[Ajanta Caves]], from the 5th century AD\nFile:Zhengding Longxing Si 2013.08.31 15-50-10.jpg|The [[Longxing Temple]] in [[Hebei]] ([[Zhengding]], China), completed in 1052 AD\nFile:Sanchi1 N-MP-220.jpg|The Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]], India)\nFile:Kofukuji08s3200.jpg|The five-storied pagoda of [[K\u014dfuku-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] ([[Nara prefecture]], Japan), completed in 669\nFile:\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e48\u0e33\u0e04\u0e37\u0e19.JPG|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] in [[Bangkok]] (Thailand), completed in the 18th century\n</gallery>\n\n==Southeast Asia==\n{{see also|Wat}}\n\n=== Oc Eo Culture ===\nPossibly the earliest examples of South East Asian architecture are [[Hindu temple]]s excavated from Cay Thi mound of the [[\u00d3c Eo]] culture from the [[Mekong Delta]], [[Southern Vietnam]] carbon-dated between the 2nd century BC to 7th century AD and constructed using granite stone and burnt bricks.

The [[Geography of Indonesia|geographic]] position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and animistic architecture of [[Oceanic art and architecture|Oceania]]. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architectural tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. \n\nGradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century [[Indies Style]] and modern [[New Indies Style]]. The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Borobudur EastGate.JPG|The Buddhist [[Borobudur]] temple, an elaborate [[stupa]] arranged in a grand [[mandala]]\nFile:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|The [[Prambanan]] temple complex dedicated to [[Trimurti]] Hindu gods\nFile:Batak Toba House.jpg|A traditional [[Batak architecture|Batak Toba house]] in North [[Sumatra]]\nFile:House in Nias North Sumatra.jpg|A [[Omo sebua|traditional house in Nias]] (North Sumatra)\n</gallery>\n\n==Oceanic==\n{{main|Oceanic art and architecture}}\n[[File:Nan madol.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Nan Madol]] on the [[Pohnpei]] island]]\nMost Oceanic buildings consist of [[hut]]s, made of wood and other vegetal materials.

Especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang Dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.\n\nFrom the [[Neolithic]] era [[Longshan Culture]] and [[Bronze Age]] era [[Erlitou culture]], the earliest [[rammed earth]] fortifications exist, with evidence of [[timber framing|timber architecture]]. The subterranean ruins of the palace at [[Yinxu]] dates back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC&ndash;1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and was eventually influenced by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] building for housing religious [[sutra]]s \u2014 the [[stupa]] \u2014 which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]] is the [[Songyue Pagoda]], a 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in [[Henan]] province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone [[spandrel|open-spandrel]] segmental [[arch bridge]].\n\n[[File:Gugong.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Forbidden City]], an example of Chinese architecture from the 15th century]]\nThe vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] who were drafted into the government by the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]]. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065&ndash;1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.\n\nThere were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.\n\nMany current Chinese architectural designs follow [[post-modern]] and [[Western world|western]] styles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:\u592a\u548c\u95e8\u96c0\u66ff.JPG|Detail of a colorful column from a gate\nFile:Hangzhou 2009 1775.jpg|Traditional [[Chinese garden]] in [[Hangzhou]] (China)\nFile:11 Temple of Heaven.jpg|Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the main building of the [[Temple of Heaven]] (Beijing)\nFile:Zhengding Longxing Si 2013.08.31 15-50-10.jpg|The [[Longxing Temple]] in [[Hebei]] ([[Zhengding]], China), completed in 1052 AD\n</gallery>\n\n=== Korean===\n{{main|Korean architecture}}\n[[File:Donggwol-do.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Donggwoldo]], a landscape of the once extensive grounds of the [[Changdeokgung|Changdeokgung Palace]], and the [[Changgyeonggung|Changgyeonggung Palace]]]]\nThe basic construction form is more or less similar to Eastern Asian building system.  From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the {{not a typo|k'an}} unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the \"inside\" and the \"outside.\"\n\nThe console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCE\u2013668 CE)\u2014in palaces in Pyongyang, for instance\u2014a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Koryo dynasty (918\u20131392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.\n\nIn the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Daeungjeon at Bulguksa-Gyeongju-Korea-01.jpg|The [[Bulguksa]] temple in [[Gyeongju]] (South Korea)\nFile:\uacbd\uc8fc \ubd88\uad6d\uc0ac \ub2e4\ubcf4\ud0d1.jpg|The [[Dabotap|Dabo Pagoda]] in Bulguksa, built in circa 751 AD\nFile:Gyeongbokgung-GeunJeongJeon.jpg|Throne Hall of the [[Gyeongbokgung]] Palace in [[Seoul]] (South Korea)\nFile:Changdeokgung Palace, Seoul, constructd in 1405 (108) (26242969507).jpg|The [[Changdeokgung Palace]], built in 1405\n</gallery>\n\n===Japanese===\n{{Main|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Himeji Castle]] from the [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]] ([[Kansai region]])]]\nJapanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. It also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.\n\nTwo new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the [[castle]], a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the ''[[shoin]]'', a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.\n\nBecause of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern [[skyscraper]] design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New [[city planning]] ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (''oku''), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Horyu-ji, November 2016.jpg|[[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] (literally Temple of the Flourishing Law), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]] ([[Nara Prefecture]]), built in the 7th century\nFile:Kinkaku-ji the Golden Temple in Kyoto overlooking the lake - high rez.JPG|[[Kinkaku-ji]] (literally \"Temple of the Golden Pavilion\"), a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] in [[Kyoto]], originally built in 1397\nFile:Kumamoto Castle 31s4272.jpg|Interior of the [[Kumamoto Castle]] in [[Kumamoto]] ([[Kumamoto Prefecture]]), built in 1467, demolished in 1877 and rebuilt in 1960\nFile:Japan 060416 Ninnaji 02.jpg|The garden of the [[Ninna-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]] ([[Kyoto Prefecture]]), an example of a [[Japanese garden]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Pre-Columbian {{anchor|Pre-Columbian}}==\n===Mesoamerican===\n{{main|Mesoamerican architecture}}\n{{see also|Mezcala culture}}\nMesoamerican architecture is the set of architectural traditions produced by pre-Columbian cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], (such as the [[Olmecs|Olmec]], [[Maya architecture|Maya]], and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec]]) traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures outside of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Mezcala culture]] (700\u2013200 BC) is known for its temple shaped sculptures, usually with an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] person in the middle.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Stone Temple Model MET 1994.35.630.jpg|[[Mezcala culture|Mezcala]] temple model with a figure in centre, 1st\u20138th century, made of stone, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|The [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] temple [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]], also known as the Temple of [[Kukulcan]], built between 9th and 12th centuries in [[Yucat\u00e1n]] (Mexico)\nFile:Palenque ruins web.jpg|Overview of the central plaza of the Mayan city of [[Palenque]] ([[Chiapas]], Mexico), a fine example of Classic period [[Mesoamerican architecture]]\nFile:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuac\u00e1n).jpg|[[Teotihuacan]] style architecture displaying decorative ornamentation made of obsidian and shell inlaid into a painted cantera surface set upon a tezontle interior\n</gallery>\n\n===Inca===\n{{main|Inca architecture}}\nIncan architecture consists of the major construction achievements developed by the [[Incas]]. The Incas developed an extensive [[Inca road system|road system]] spanning most of the western length of the continent. [[Inca rope bridge]]s could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (It would have been impractical for the terrain) or horses, they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-[[llama]] traffic. Much of present-day architecture at the former Inca capital [[Cuzco]] shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city [[Machu Picchu]] is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|View of [[Machu Picchu]] in [[Peru]], built in circa 1450 AD\nFile:Machu Picchu - temple.jpg|The Main Temple of Machu Picchu\nFile:Cusco Piedra de los doce angulos.jpg|The [[Twelve-angled stone]], part of a stone wall of an Inca palace, and a national heritage object\nFile:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|[[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry at [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient of North America===\nInside what is the present-day United States, the Mississippians<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mississippian-culture | title = Mississippian culture | work =  Answers.com}}</ref> and the Pueblo<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482743/pueblo-architecture | title = Pueblo architecture | encyclopedia = Britannica}}</ref> created substantial public architecture.

The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-era]] architecture in Europe and, following the [[Fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]] by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, leading directly to the [[Ottoman architecture|architecture of the Ottoman Empire]].\n\nEarly Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of [[Roman architecture]]. [[Architectural style|Stylistic drift]], [[pendentive|technological advancement]], and [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|political]] and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged, which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric [[Cruciform|complexity]], brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, [[classical orders]] were used more freely, [[mosaic]]s replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and windows filtered light through thin sheets of [[alabaster]] to softly illuminate interiors. This Byzantine style, with increasingly exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, traveled west to [[Ravenna]] and [[Venice]] and as far north as [[Moscow]]. Most of the churches and basilicas have high-riding domes. As result, they created vast open spaces at the centres of churches, heightening the sense of grace and light. The round arch is a fundamental of Byzantine style. Magnificent golden mosaics with their graphic simplicity and immense power brought light and warmth into the heart of churches. Byzantine capitals break away from the Classical conventions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. Sinuous lines and naturalistic forms are precursors to the [[Gothic style]].\n\nAccording to descriptions, interiors were plated with [[marble]] or stone. Some of the columns were also made of marble. Other widely used materials were bricks and stone, not just marble like in [[Classical antiquity]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dimitriu Hurmuziadis|first1=Lucia|title=Cultura Greciei|date=1979|publisher=Editura \u0219tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i enciclopedic\u0103|isbn=|page=93|url=|language=ro}}</ref> Mural paintings or mosaics made of shiny little stones were also elements of interior architecture.

Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s \"historicising\" and \"modernising\" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.\n\nRomanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since [[Roman architecture|Roman Imperial architecture]] and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the [[Romanesque art|art it describes]], but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, [[barrel vault]]s, and cruciform piers supporting vaults.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral Choir.jpg|Interior of the [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[Durham, England|Durham]] (England), built between 1093 and 1133, additions until 1490 \nFile:Vezelay WLM2016 La basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (3).jpg|Stone bas-relief of [[Jesus]], from the [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]] ([[Burgundy]], France)\nFile:Maria Lach 02.jpg|[[Maria Laach Abbey]], situated on the southwestern shore of the [[Laacher See]] (Lake Laach), near [[Andernach]] (Germany), built in the 11th-12th centuries\nFile:StrasbourgCath CroisN 21.JPG|Part of a stained glass window from [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg]] in [[Strasbourg]] (France)\n</gallery>\n\n====Gothic====\n{{Main|Gothic architecture}}\nThe various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th- and 12th-century building projects, particularly in the [[\u00cele de France]] area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|12th-century abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]]. Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external [[flying buttress]]es, pointed [[arch]]es using the [[ogive]] shape, [[Rib vault|ribbed vaults]], clustered columns, [[pinnacle]]s and sharply pointed [[spires]] and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]].

It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of [[Peter the Great]] (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.\n\nThe [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] is one of Russia's most distinctive sights. Built by Tsar [[Ivan IV]] (also known as Ivan the Terrible) to commemorate his defeat of the Mongols at the battle [[Kazan]] in 1552, it stands just outside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in the [[Red Square]], in the heart of [[Moscow]]. Its extraordinary [[Onion dome|onion-shaped domes]], painted in bright colours, create a memorable skyline, making St. Basil's Cathedral a symbol both of Moscow and Russia as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson|first1=Philip|title=Great Buildings|date=2017|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK]]|isbn=978-0-2412-9883-1|page=121|url=|language=en}}</ref> Each of the domes has its own dazzling form of decoration, ranging from prisms and spirals to chevrons and stripes, all emphasised with brilliant colours.

This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts.\n\n[[File:Amsterdam, straatzicht Oudezijds Voorburgwal foto1 2014-01-12 13.42.jpg|thumb|Houses of this type were built between about 1600 and 1665, examples of Dutch Renaissance architecture]]\nThe development from [[Medieval architecture]] concerned the way [[geometry]] mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in [[Renaissance art]], and helped shape new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist thought]].\n\nPerspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to ''describing'' experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality.\n<!--should this be kept?:\n[[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Cortile del Belvedere]] project is one such instance where spaces were pictured/designed together before being built. Such a space was only possible due to the powers of abstraction, offered by perspective, that allowed the composition of heterogeneous activities into a metaphor for the legitimacy of current rule. The commission was set by [[Pope Julius II]] to connect an ancient pontifical palace on the right of St Peter's with the palace, built by Pollaiolo for Innocent VIII. In doing so Bramante organised the ascent through three courts that sees the lower, theatrical level move into the upper level through increasingly planned gardens thereby creating a tension between the human realm and an idealised vision of the \"ideal city\", Jerusalem, this is explicitly shown in Bramante's depiction of the ascent from the perspective of Pope Julius's bedroom window.-->\n\nThe Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], and the style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515\u201347). (See [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]). The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]], who was engaged after 1540 in work at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].\n\nArchitects such as [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Giacomo Vignola]], and [[Pierre Lescot]], were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the [[Cour Carr\u00e9e]] of the [[Louvre]] in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by [[Jean Goujon]]. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].\n\nIn England, the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573\u20131652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of [[Andrea Palladio]] was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and [[turret]]s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:View of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.jpg|The [[Florence Cathedral]], built between 1296 and 1436 in [[Florence]] (Italy)\n\nH\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin.jpg|The [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] in [[Toulouse]] (France), an example of a 16th century [[h\u00f4tel particulier]]\n\nFenetre-vieux-raisin (2).jpg|Double window of the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, decorated with a [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it, an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column in the middle, and [[caryatid]]s at its edges\n\nRaisin-medaillon-3.jpg|Medallion and a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] pilaster's capital, on H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin\n\nDetail 1 h\u00f4tel du Vieux raisin.JPG|Various ornaments widely used in Renaissance [[applied arts]], including [[putto|putti]] and [[festoon|festoons]], on a wall of the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin\n\nFenetre-assezat-cour (2).jpg|[[Cross-window]] from [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], with a round and broken [[pediment]] above it\n\nFile:Castle of Chenonceau 33.jpg|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], built between 1514 and 1522 in France\n\nSalon of Francis I of France in the Castle of Chenonceau.jpg|The fireplace from the Salon of [[Francis I of France]], in Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau\n</gallery>\n\n==European and colonial architecture==\n{{main|Colonial architecture}}\nWith the rise of various European [[colonial empire]]s from the 16th century onward through the early 20th century, the new stylistic trends of Europe were exported to or adopted by locations around the world, often evolving into new regional variations.\n\n===Baroque===\n{{Main|Baroque architecture}}\n[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]] (Austria), built between 1716 and 1737]]\n\nThe [[Baroque]] and its late variant the [[Rococo]] were the first truly global styles in the arts. Dominating more than two centuries of art and architecture in Europe, Latin America and beyond from circa 1580 to circa 1800, they were the first to focus so intensely on their impact on the viewer, and they owed much of their popularity and global scope to this visual allure. Born in the painting studios of [[Bologna]] and [[Rome]] in the 1580s and 1590s, and in Roman sculptural and architectural ateliers in the second and third decades of the 17th century, the Baroque spread swiftly throughout [[Italian Baroque architecture|Italy]], [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spain]] and [[Baroque architecture in Portugal|Portugal]], Flanders, [[French Baroque architecture|France]], the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as to central and eastern European centres from [[Munich]] (Germany) to [[Vilnius]] ([[Lithuania]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Gauvin Alexander|title=Baroque & Rococo|date=2012|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978-0-7148-5742-8|page=24 & 4|url=|language=en}}</ref> \n\nBaroque architecture originated in 17th century [[Rome]], where it developed as an expression on the newly triumphant [[Catholic Church]].

The interior effects were often achieved with the use of ''[[quadratura]]'',  or ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'' painting combined with sculpture: the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling.  Light was also used for dramatic effect;  it streamed down from cupolas and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. [[Solomonic column]]s were often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.<ref>Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102</ref> A characteristically Baroque form of ornamentation, the [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] is an oval panel with crested or scrolled borders, used on palace, house and church fa\u00e7ades as a framing device for a [[monogram]] (of the owner, the architect or the person to whom it is dedicated), cresting or coat of arms, but also as a purely decorative infill motif.

Although the style originated in the rich decoration at the [[Palace of Versailles]], it was also a reaction to the formality of the royal palace. [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]], [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], [[Nicolas Pineau]] and [[Germain Boffrand]] were among the designers who succeeded in reflecting the more intimate scale and comfortable arrangement of rooms by decorating them with light, frivolous and colourful schemes in which panels and door-frames dissolved and walls merged with the ceiling. The repertoire of motifs, including [[Rocaille]] [[arabesque]]s and [[chinoiserie]]s, was infinitely varied. Characteristic of the style were Rocaille motifs derived from the shells, icicles and rockwork or grotto decoration. Rocaille arabesques were mostly abstract forms, laid out symmetrically over and around architectural frames. A favourite motif was the scallop shell, whose top scrolls echoed the basic S and C framework scrolls of the arabesques and whose sinuous ridges echoed the general curvilinearity of the room decoration. While few Rococo exteriors were built in France, a number of Rococo churches are found in southern Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Emily|title=Architectural Details|date=2002|publisher=Ivy Press|isbn=978-1-78240-169-8|page=270|url=|language=en}}</ref> Other widely-user motifs in decorative arts and interior architecture include: asymmetrical shells, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, angels and [[Chinoiserie|Far Eastern elements]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=193 & 194|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\nRococo features exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}\n\nThe style often integrated painting, molded stucco and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where [[Putto|putti]] and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included stucco, either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze.

This [[Palladian architecture]] and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque, informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the [[Grand Tour]], coupled with the excavations of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].\n\nThe shift to [[Neoclassical architecture]] is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]'s excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and [[Robert Adam]], was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. \n\nThe style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. [[Federal architecture|Federal-style architecture]] is the name for the classicizing architecture built in [[North America]] between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815.  This style shares its name with its era, the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]]. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Regency style]] in Britain and to the French [[Empire style]]. In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Klassizismus}}, {{lang-ru|\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0437\u043c}}), while the newer [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revival styles]] of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Paris - Palais du Louvre - PA00085992 - 2015 - 004.jpg|Extraordinary detail of a ceiling from the [[Galerie d'Apollon]] (part of the [[Louvre]]), completed between 1766 and 1781\nFile:Grand escalier de l'op\u00e9ra de Bordeaux.jpg|Stairway of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Theater of Bordeaux]], by [[Victor Louis]], built in 1780\nFile:Compi\u00e8gne (60), palais, salon Bleu 3.jpg|The Blue Salon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]] from [[Compi\u00e8gne]] (France), an example of an [[Empire style|Empire]] interior\nFile:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia), completed 1858, an example of [[Greek Revival architecture]]\nFile:Akademie von Athen.jpg|The [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], designed as part of an architectural \"trilogy\" in 1859 by the Danish architect [[Theophil Hansen]], along with the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University]] and the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]]\nFile:Fantana cantacuzino.JPG|The Cantacuzino fountain from [[Bucharest]] (Romania), finished in 1870\nFile:\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043c. \u0410.\u041b. \u0428\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430-7.jpg|Interior of the [[Stieglitz Museum of Applied Arts]] in [[Sankt Petersburg]] (Russia), built between 1885 and 1896\nFile:Bucuresti, Romania.

The work of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] in Brussels, [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] in Barcelona, [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new. \n\nArt Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration: either [[ornament (art)|ornament]]al (based on flowers and plants, e.g. thistles,<ref>[http://art.nouveau.world/thistle Thistle - Art Nouveau World]</ref> irises,<ref>[http://art.nouveau.world/iris Iris - Art Nouveau World]</ref> cyclamens, orchids, water lilies, etc.) or sculptural (see the [[Art Nouveau#Sculpture|respective section]] below). While faces of people (or [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]]s) are referred to ornament, the use of people in different forms of sculpture (statues and reliefs: see the [[Art Nouveau#Sculpture|respective section]] below) were also typical for Art Nouveau. Before [[Vienna Secession]], [[Jugendstil]] and [[National romantic style]] fa\u00e7ades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome [[ceramic tile]]s. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111</ref> The [[Whiplash (decorative art)|whiplash motif]], adapted from vegetal forms, was widely used.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Tassel House stairway.JPG|Interior of the [[H\u00f4tel Tassel]] built between 1892 and 1893 by [[Victor Horta]], in [[Bruxelles]] (Belgium)\n\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|Entrance of the [[Castel B\u00e9ranger]] in Paris, by [[Hector Guimard]]\n\nFile:Hotel Dacia, Satu Mare Romania 1.JPG|The [[Dacia Hotel]] built in 1902, in [[Satu Mare]] ([[Romania]])\n\nFile:Casa Batllo Overview Barcelona Spain cut.jpg|The [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] in [[Barcelona]] (Spain), an iconic Art Nouveau masterpiece\n\nXDSC 7288-29-av-Rapp-paris-7.jpg|Highly decorated door in Paris, at the entrance of the [[Lavirotte Building]]\n\nPhotograph, Dining Room, H\u00f4tel Guimard, Rue Mozart, Paris, ca. 1910 (CH 18411061).jpg|Dining Room of the [[H\u00f4tel Guimard]], about 1910\n\nTimisoara Cartierul Iosefin (1).JPG|Detail of a 1910 building, with a female [[mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]], in [[Timi\u0219oara]] (Romania)\n\nAntwerpen Jugendstil Waterloostraat Herfst, Winter, Zomer en Lente 10.jpg|[[Mosaic]] representing summer, on a house from [[Antwerp]] ([[Belgium]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Modern===\n{{Further|Modern architecture}}\n<!--[[File:Falling Water 01.jpg|thumb]]-->\n\nEarly Modern architecture began with a number of building styles with similar characteristics, primarily the simplification of form and the elimination of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], that first arose around 1900. By the 1940s these styles had largely consolidated and been identified as the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]].\n\nThe exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate. An important trigger appears to have been the [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] credited to [[Louis Sullivan]]: \"[[form follows function]]\". [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in architecture, is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].\n\n===Expressionist===\n[[File:Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|[[Goetheanum]] by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1923]]\n{{Main|Expressionist architecture}}\n\nExpressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts.\n\nThe style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural [[Biomorphism|biomorphic]] forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in [[World War I]] and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.<ref>Jencks, p.59</ref> Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,<ref>Sharp, p.68</ref> resulting in many of the most important Expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Casa Nova. Zukunftsarchitektur - Formenspiel und Feinbau''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the Expressionist imagination,<ref>Pehnt, p.163</ref> and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate.\n\n===Art Deco===\n{{main|Art Deco|Streamline Moderne}}\n[[File:Chrysler Building spire, Manhattan, by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04444).jpg|thumb|right|140px|The [[Art Deco]] [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]] (1930)]]\nThe [[Art Deco]] style in architecture emerged in Paris just before [[World War I]] with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] by [[Auguste Perret]] (1911\u20131913) and the Majorelle Building by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1913). Its revolutionary use of reinforced concrete, geometric forms, straight lines, and decorative sculpture applied to the outside of the building in plaques of marble, ceramics and stucco, and later in stainless steel, were a departure from [[Art Nouveau]].  The style reached its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, and took its name from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] in Paris in 1925.  \n\nArt Deco became especially popular in the United States in the late 1920s, where the style was used for [[skyscrapers]] including the [[Chrysler Building]] (1930) and [[Empire State Building]] (1931), and for lavish motion picture palaces including [[Radio City Music Hall]] (1932) in [[New York City]] and the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in [[Oakland, California]].  In the 1930s a stripped-down variation called [[Streamline Moderne]] emerged, which was inspired by the curving aerodynamic forms of ocean liners, airplanes and trains.  Art Deco was used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations and movie theaters around the world in the 1930s, but declined rapidly at the end of the decade due to the [[Great Depression]] and intense criticism of the style by modernist architects such as [[Le Corbusier]], who denounced what he felt was its excessive ornament. By 1939, the style was largely out of fashion and was replaced by the more austere [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=175-206}}\n\n===International Style===\n[[File:Glaspaleis front-east.jpg|thumb|The [[Glaspaleis|Glass Palace]], a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, The Netherlands (1935)]]\n{{Main|International Style (architecture)}}\n\nThe International style was a major [[architectural style|architectural trend]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before World War II. The term had its origin from the name of a book by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]] which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the International Style thus constitute part of [[modernism]].\n\nThe ideas of Modernism were developed especially in what was taught at the German [[Bauhaus]] School in [[Weimar]] (from 1919), [[Dessau]] (between 1926\u201332) and finally [[Berlin]] between 1932\u201333, under the leadership first of its founder [[Walter Gropius]], then [[Hannes Meyer]], and finally [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Modernist theory in architecture resided in the attempt to bypass the question of what [[Architectural style|style]] a building should be built in, a concern that had overshadowed 19th-century architecture, and the wish to reduce form to its most minimal expression of structure and function. In the United States, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] treated this new phenomenon in 1931 as if it represented a new style \u2013 the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]], thereby misrepresenting its primary mission as merely a matter of eliminating traditional [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]. The core effort to pursue Modern architecture as an abstract, scientific programme was more faithfully carried forward in [[Europe]], but issues of style always overshadowed its stricter and more puritan goals, not least in the work of [[Le Corbusier]]. \n<!--Brutalism-->\n<!--Mid-Century Modern-->\n<!--High Tech-->\n<!--Structuralism-->\n\n===Contemporary===\n[[File:Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology, Krakow, Poland.jpg|thumb|Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in [[Cracow]], Poland, by [[Arata Isozaki]] and Krzysztof Ingarden (1994)]]\n\n{{main|Contemporary architecture}}\n\n===Modern===\n{{Main|Modern architecture}}\nModern architecture is generally characterized by simplification of form and creation of ornament from the structure and theme of the building.

In a broader sense, modern architecture began at the turn of the 20th century with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the [[modernization]] of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.<ref name=GEMbook />\n\n===Critical regionalism===\n[[File:Sydney Opera House Sails.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sydney Opera House]], designed to evoke the sails of yachts in Sydney harbour]]\n{{Main|Critical regionalism}}\n\nCritical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in [[Modern architecture]] by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]] and later more famously by [[Kenneth Frampton]].\n\nFrampton put forth his views in \"Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance.\" He evokes [[Paul Ric\u0153ur]]'s question of \"how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization\". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] to supplement his arguments.\n\n===Postmodern===\n{{Main|Postmodern architecture}}\n[[File:1000-de-la-gauchetiere.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]], with ornamented and strongly defined top, middle and bottom. Contrast with the modernist [[Seagram Building]] and [[Torre Picasso]].]]\nPostmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. [[Postmodernity]] in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of \"wit, ornament and reference\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] and formalized shapes and spaces of the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse [[aesthetics]]: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.\n\nClassic examples of [[modern architecture]] are the [[Lever House]] and the [[Seagram Building]] in commercial space, and the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or the [[Bauhaus]] movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the [[Portland Building]] in [[Portland, OR|Portland]] and the [[Sony Building (New York City)]] (originally AT&T Building) in New York City, which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which was studied by [[Robert Venturi]] in his 1972 book ''Learning from Las Vegas'' celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that \"Less is a bore\", inverting [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s dictum that \"Less is more\".\n\nFollowing the postmodern movement, a renaissance of pre-modernist urban and architectural ideals established itself, with [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] being prominent movements.\n\n===Deconstructivist===\n[[File:Imperial War Museum North, Old Trafford, Manchester - geograph.org.uk - 1660068.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Manchester]] comprises three apparently intersecting curved volumes.]]\n{{Main|Deconstructivism}}\n\nDeconstructivism in architecture is a development of [[postmodern architecture]] that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent [[non-Euclidean geometry]],<ref>Husserl, ''Origins of Geometry'', Introduction by Jacques Derrida</ref> (i.e., non-[[rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]], such as structure and [[building envelope|envelope]]. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist \"styles\" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos.\n\nImportant events in the history of the Deconstructivist movement include the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]] (especially the entry from the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] and the American architect [[Peter Eisenman]]<ref>Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997)</ref> and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s winning entry), the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]], and the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]]'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] (USA), opened in 2006]]\n\n==The 21st century==\n{{further|2000 in architecture}}\nOn January 21, 2013 architects began preparations for constructing the world's first [[3D printing|3D-printed]] building.

This led to the building of Yale Road (today [[Old Yale Road]]), the first transportation route to link the [[Fraser Valley]]. The settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown grant to obtain the {{convert|160|acre|km2}} that would become Abbotsford.\n\nThe Gur Sikh Temple, located on 33089 South Fraser Way, is the oldest Sikh temple in North America.

Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]] with the [[Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway]] at [[Sumas, Washington]]. This route was the only rail connection between [[Vancouver]] and [[Seattle]] until 1904. The Village of Abbotsford was incorporated in 1892. At that time Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, but also sold off a significant portion to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]'s subsidiary company the [[Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway]]. The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with [[Vancouver]] and [[Chilliwack]] was called, was discontinued in 1950, but BCER's successor [[BC Hydro]] retains the right to re-introduce passenger rail service. Service to Vancouver runs from neighbouring Mission by way of the [[West Coast Express]].\n\nThe most notable natural disaster to hit Abbotsford was a major flood of the [[Fraser River]] in 1948.\n\nIn September 1984 [[Pope John Paul II]] held an open-air Mass for over 200,000 people at the [[Abbotsford International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/Page3457.aspx|title=Abbotsford Airport - Airport History|work=abbotsfordairport.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe amalgamation of the Village of Abbotsford and the [[District of Sumas]] into the District of Abbotsford occurred in 1972.

In the 2005\u20132006 hockey season, Abbotsford's bantam AAA team were ultimately the Western Canadian Bantam Champions, and eight individual players from this team (the most ever) were selected in the 2006 WHL Bantam Draft.\n\nThe [[Abbotsford Pilots]] of the [[Pacific International Junior Hockey League]] (junior B level) play at MSA Arena, which is Abbotsford's second largest arena at just over 400 seats. Abbotsford was considered as a possible home for the [[Chilliwack Chiefs (1990\u20132006)|Chilliwack Chiefs]] (junior A), who were forced to move in 2006 when the [[Chilliwack Bruins]] (a WHL expansion team) took over their arena, Prospera Centre. Abbotsford would have become the home of the Chiefs if the city had supported them in building a new arena; instead, the Chiefs moved to Langley. Construction has now been completed in Abbotsford on a far bigger sports and entertainment centre (with 7,500 seats).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sporttowncanada.com/ |title=Abbotsford sports website |publisher=Sporttowncanada.com |accessdate=2011-03-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827171055/http://www.sporttowncanada.com/ |archivedate=August 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nFrom 2009 until 2014, Abbotsford hosted the [[NHL]]'s [[Calgary Flames]]' [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Abbotsford Heat]].<ref name=\"Province01\">{{cite news|url=https://theprovince.com/sports/soccer/Flames+farm+team+move+Abbotsford/1382018/story.html|title=Flames' farm team set to move to Abbotsford|last=Hall|first=Vicki|date=March 12, 2009|publisher=Vancouver Province|accessdate=2009-03-16}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=9993 theahl.com], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501230443/http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=9993 |date=May 1, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fraservalleyahl.com/2009-05-14-news.pdf |title=The HEAT is on for 2009\u201310 AHL season |publisher=Fraser Valley Sports & Entertainment Ltd. |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711023045/http://www.fraservalleyahl.com/2009-05-14-news.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/abbotsford-heat-leave-city-with-12m-in-losses-1.2610985|title=Abbotsford Heat leave city with $12M in losses|date=April 15, 2014|work=cbc.ca}}</ref> Home games were played at the [[Abbotsford Entertainment & Sports Centre]].\n\n=== Other sports ===\nFrom 2012 and 2013, the [[BC Angels]] of the [[Legends Football League]]'s LFL Canada division played at the Abbotsford Entertainment & Sports Centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=LFL Canada Releases BC Team Name & Logo| url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-canada-releases-bc-team-name/| work=www.lfl360.com| accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>\n\nAbbotsford's [[Rotary Stadium|Jane and Gerry Swan Track at Rotary Stadium]] is home to the [[Valley Royals Track & Field Club]], who have produced numerous Olympians including two for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]].

Abbotsford borders the town of [[Sumas, Washington]] to the south. Much of Abbotsford has views of [[Mount Baker]] (to the southeast, in Washington) and the [[Coast Mountains]] (to the north).\n\n== History ==\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nPrior to [[colonization]], the St\u00f3:l\u014d people were the first inhabitants of the region that is now known as Abbotsford. Throughout history and the current state of the [[St\u00f3:l\u014d Nation]], their traditional territory was \u201cnever ceded through treaty, war, or surrender\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" /> The traditional land of the [[St\u00f3:l\u014d Nation]] extends beyond the [[Fraser River]] and into the [[Fraser Canyon]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.missionmuseum.com/local-history/stolo/|title=Sto:lo|website=Mission Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> The term \u201cS'\u00f3lh T\u00e9m\u00e9xw\u201d is used to describe the St\u00f3:l\u014d Nation's traditional and ancestral territory, and the St\u00f3:l\u014d people are known to have lived in this territory since \u201ctime immemorial\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stolonation.bc.ca/|title=Sto:lo Nation|website=www.stolonation.bc.ca|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> An archaeological estimate of the time period in which the St\u00f3:l\u014d people have inhabited the land is roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/Salish/Halkomelem/Halq%27em%C3%A9ylem|title=FirstVoices|website=www.firstvoices.com|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\nMany of the lifestyle traditions of the St\u00f3:l\u014d people involved reliance on local plant life, as well as fishing and hunting. The St\u00f3:l\u014d people also maintained trading relations with various other [[Coast Salish]] peoples and communities.<ref name=\":1\" /> St\u00f3:l\u014d communities were organized into villages along the banks of the [[Fraser River]]. These communities lived in large, wooden structures known as [[longhouse]]s, which were passed down from each generation onto the next.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfu.museum/time/en/panoramas/beach/the-stolo-people/|title=A Journey into Time Immemorial|last=Centre|first=Simon Fraser University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and Learning and Instructional Development|website=www.sfu.museum|language=English|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> Each [[longhouse]] was usually inhabited by an entire extended family. St\u00f3:l\u014d family structures include complex relationships between immediate family, ancestors, neighbours, and the land.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===European colonization ===\nAbbotsford's colonial development began when the [[Royal Engineers]] surveyed the area in response to the [[gold rush]] along the [[Fraser River]] in 1858. This led to the building of Yale Road (today [[Old Yale Road]]), the first transportation route to link the [[Fraser Valley]]. The settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown grant to obtain the {{convert|160|acre|km2}} that would become Abbotsford.\n\nThe Gur Sikh Temple, located on 33089 South Fraser Way, is the oldest Sikh temple in North America. Being built from 1908 to 1911, it is now over 100 years old, outlasting the now demolished 2nd Avenue temple in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Reach |url=https://thereach.pastperfectonline.com/photo/9C750672-4602-4D7A-95F6-153908429876 |website=thereach.pastperfectonline.com |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere is some controversy over the origin of the Abbotsford name.<ref name=BCPN>{{cite book|last= Thorburn |first= Mark |title= British Columbia Place Names |year= 2009 |publisher= Dragon Hill Publishing Ltd |isbn= 978-1-896124-46-9 |pages= 336 }}</ref> The most commonly cited origin is that Maclure named the land \"Abbotsford\" after family friend Henry Braithwaite Abbott, the western superintendent of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].<ref>WS Crocket 1905 Abbotsford Adam and Black London [https://web.archive.org/web/20020602132034/http://www.abbotsford.net/msamuseum/history.htm History of Abbotsford].

Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]] with the [[Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway]] at [[Sumas, Washington]]. This route was the only rail connection between [[Vancouver]] and [[Seattle]] until 1904. The Village of Abbotsford was incorporated in 1892. At that time Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, but also sold off a significant portion to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]'s subsidiary company the [[Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway]]. The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with [[Vancouver]] and [[Chilliwack]] was called, was discontinued in 1950, but BCER's successor [[BC Hydro]] retains the right to re-introduce passenger rail service. Service to Vancouver runs from neighbouring Mission by way of the [[West Coast Express]].\n\nThe most notable natural disaster to hit Abbotsford was a major flood of the [[Fraser River]] in 1948.\n\nIn September 1984 [[Pope John Paul II]] held an open-air Mass for over 200,000 people at the [[Abbotsford International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/Page3457.aspx|title=Abbotsford Airport - Airport History|work=abbotsfordairport.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe amalgamation of the Village of Abbotsford and the [[District of Sumas]] into the District of Abbotsford occurred in 1972.

It is the third largest municipal police force in British Columbia (behind Vancouver and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]). {{as of|2006}}, the Abbotsford Police Department employed nearly 200 officers and 80 civilian employees.\n\nThe Abbotsford Police Department was officially formed in 1995 when the District of Matsqui and the District of Abbotsford amalgamated to become the City of Abbotsford. Prior to the amalgamation, the District of Matsqui was patrolled by the Matsqui police and the District of Abbotsford by the RCMP. During the referendum citizens elected to keep a municipal police force.\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:East Abbotsford looking towards Mission.jpg|thumb|Private residences near Upper Ten Oaks in eastern Abbotsford looking north-by-northwest towards [[Mission, BC]]]]\nThese places represent parts of the city that have more than one neighbourhood in them.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* Abbotsford East\n* Abbotsford West\n* Aberdeen\n* Bradner\n* Central Abbotsford\n* Matsqui\n* Poplar\n* Sumas Mountain\n* Sumas Prairie\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aberdeen, Abbotsford|Aberdeen]]\n* [[Arnold, British Columbia|Arnold]]\n* Auguston\n* Blueridge\n* [[Bradner, Abbotsford|Bradner]]\n* [[Clayburn, Abbotsford|Clayburn]]\n* [[Clearbrook, Abbotsford|Clearbrook]]\n* Downtown\n* Eagle Mountain\n* [[Gifford, British Columbia|Gifford]]\n* Glen Mountain\n* [[Huntingdon, Abbotsford|Huntingdon]]\n* [[Kilgard, Abbotsford|Kilgard]]\n* [[District of Matsqui|Matsqui]]\n* [[McKinley Heights]]\n* Mill Lake\n* [[Mount Lehman, Abbotsford|Mount Lehman]]\n* [[North Poplar, British Columbia|North Poplar]]\n* [[Peardonville, British Columbia|Peardonville]]\n* [[Pepin Brook, British Columbia|Pepin Brook]]\n* Sandy Hill\n* [[South Poplar, British Columbia|South Poplar]]\n* [[Straiton, British Columbia|Straiton]]\n* Townline\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sister cities==\n* [[Fukagawa, Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Japan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.city.fukagawa.lg.jp/cms/section/kikaku/ik75k400000012l9.html|title=\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u6df1\u5ddd\u5e02\uff5c \u59c9\u59b9\u90fd\u5e02\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u30fb\u30a2\u30dc\u30c4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u5e02|last=\u6df1\u5ddd\u5e02\u5f79\u6240|website=\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u6df1\u5ddd\u5e02}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Karen Lee Batten]]\n* [[Chase Claypool]]\n* [[Ryan Craig (hockey)|Ryan Craig]]\n* [[Kyle Cumiskey]]\n* [[Frank Davey]]\n* [[Akam (wrestler)|Sunny Dhinsa]]\n* [[Dianne Doan]]\n* [[Brian Doerksen]]\n* [[Burkely Duffield]]\n* [[Victoria Duffield]]\n* [[Jared Falk]]\n* [[Michael Funk]]\n* [[Amy Gough]]\n* [[Adam Hadwin]]\n* [[Charles Hill-Tout]]\n* [[Jacob Hoggard]]\n* [[Chad Kroeger]]\n* [[Evangeline Lilly]]\n* [[Brad Moran (hockey)|Brad Moran]]\n* [[Greg Neufeld]]\n* [[Larry Nickel]]\n* [[Gladys Powers]]\n* [[Jordan Pritchett]]\n* [[Nathan Lieuwen]]\n* [[Mauro Ranallo]]\n* [[Sophie Schmidt]]\n* [[Jared Slingerland]]\n* [[Devon Toews]]\n* [[David Van der Gulik]]\n* [[Jake Virtanen]]\n* [[Shane Wiebe]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abbotsford News]]\n* [[Abbotsford Times]]\n* [[Coat of arms of Abbotsford, British Columbia]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings in Abbotsford, British Columbia]]\n* [[Mission Bridge]]\n* [[Mission Railway Bridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Abbotsford}}\n{{commons category|Abbotsford, British Columbia}}\n{{Wikinews|Indo-Canadian teens kidnapped, found dead in car}}\n*{{Official|http://www.abbotsford.ca/}}\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Abbotsford\n| North = [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]\n| Northeast = [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]]/[[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]]\n| East = [[Chilliwack]]\n| Southeast = [[Maple Falls, Washington]]\n| South = [[Sumas, Washington]]<br>[[Everson, Washington]]\n| Southwest = [[Lynden, Washington]]\n| West = [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Township of Langley]] ([[Aldergrove, British Columbia|Aldergrove]])\n| Northwest = [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]]\n| image = }}\n{{Subdivisions of British Columbia|city=yes}}\n{{Census metropolitan areas in Canada by size}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Abbotsford, British Columbia| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1892]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sentence case for section heading, per MOS:HEAD", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbotsford,_British_Columbia"}
