Australia won the series 4\u20130, with one match drawn.\n\nThis was India's inaugural tour of Australia and it was also the first tour by a team representing the newly independent India.  Independence had been finalised only two months before the tour began.\n\nAs evident from the scoreline, the Australian team greatly outclassed the Indians, who had some good individual performances to their credit. However, they did not put up much resistance as a team, with their batting failing to make any impression on the Australians. The only silver lining for India in terms of match results was their two victories in the First Class Matches.\n\n== Touring party ==\nA sub-committee under the chairmanship of [[Anthony de Mello (cricket administrator)|Anthony de Mello]] was formed to recommend to the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] the India team to tour Australia the following season.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=Indian Cricket Team for Australia, Personnel to be Announced On Mar. 17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-3o-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_EsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4162%2C3971634 |accessdate=15 August 2018 |newspaper=The Indian Express |date=2 March 1947 |page=3}}</ref> The touring party comprising 17 players was announced 17 March 1947.

this match, and they had a below-par win-loss ratio of one win and two losses, both being innings defeats. Australia, though, had a remarkable record in their last ten test series, winning eight of them, and three out of a total three series after the war. Their win-loss record was exemplary as well, winning 29 and losing only 7, out of 45 tests.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/australia/engine/records/team/series_results.html?class=1;id=2;type=team Australia-Records-Test matches-Series results]</ref> However, the Indian team had reason to believe that they could punch above their weight, as they had unearthed in [[Vinoo Mankad]], a talented [[all-rounder]], who had taken 39 wickets in those six matches, and had also scored 516 runs from 11 innings at an average of 46.90, and their captain [[Lala Amarnath]]'s good run with the bat and the emergence of a future batting stalwart for India, Vijay Hazare, made India's prospects look a little brighter. However, Australia's captain, [[Don Bradman]] was a major stumbling block in India's path. At the start of the series his record was: 42 test matches, 5773 runs, Average of 97.84.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/4188.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=cumulative Statistics-Statsguru-DG Bradman]</ref> Worryingly, for the touring side, He had already scored heavily against the Indian attack for the Australian XI outfit against India, an imposing 172. So his presence meant definite trouble for Lala Amarnath's side.\n\n'''Match Report'''\n\nThe Brisbane pitch was quite benign and did not trouble the Australians, who chose to bat first after winning the toss. The Australian top order were in full control of the match from the start, stringing partnerships effectively. Don Bradman scored 185, piling on runs and misery on the Indian bowlers, who toiled in vain on a pitch that did not support them. He anchored partnerships with the other batsmen, and even when he ran out of partners, Wisden noted, \"...but completely demoralised the bowlers by punishing methods which brought runs at a terrific rate.\" his knock contained twenty fours. Australia ended the first day with their scorecard reading: 273/3, and Bradman being unbeaten on 160.\n\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:ErnieToshack.jpg|thumb|right|Ernie Toshack rocked the Indians with match figures of 11/31]] -->\n\nIn the second day, only one hour of play was possible due to rain, and Australia went through the scheduled hour of play without losing a wicket, and adding 36 runs more. Surprisingly, a large attendance of 11,000 people came to watch the day's play. The third day of the match saw yet another burst of rain, which saturated the pitch. Bradman had been dismissed by then for a two-hundred-and-eighty-five-minute vigil that yielded 185 runs, placed Australia on a safe perch at 382 for 8. Realizing that the uncovered pitch could be advantageous for Australia's bowlers, Bradman declared; leaving the Indian side the daunting prospect of negotiating, what, in Wisden's words, was a \"treacherous\" pitch.\n\nThe Indian batsmen, who were accustomed to \"...the fast, hard pitches in their own country...\", could not cope up with the Australian bowling, and especially struggled against the bowling of [[Ernie Toshack]], who exploited the conditions in a versatile manner, and in an extremely short spell of nineteen balls, returned remarkable figures of 5 wickets for a solitary run. The Indians crumbled to 58 all out.\n\nTrailing by 324, the Indians had to climb a mountain to evade a huge innings defeat, but were unable to do so, as none of their batsmen except [[Chandu Sarwate]], offered any resistance. Sarwate, batted for two hours and forty minutes-160 minutes, to graft a determined 26. However, the other Indians again crumbled in the face of some quality pace, again, by Toshack himself (he took 6 wickets for 29 runs), and collapsed to be 98 all out, thus, Australia wrapped up the match, inflicting an innings-and-226-runs drubbing on the Indians. This defeat, Wisden noted could have been confidence-sapping for the Indians.<ref>{{cite web |title=First Test Match, Australia v India 1947-48 |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152904.html |work=Wisden |publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}</ref>\n\n===2nd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 12\u201318 December 1947\n| team1 = {{cr|IND}}\n| team2 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 188 (70 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Dattu Phadkar]] 51 (97)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Colin McCool]] 3/71 (18 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 107 (46.2 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Ron Hamence]] 25 (77)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Vijay Hazare]] 4/29 (13.2 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 61/7 (37 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Lala Amarnath]] 14 (25)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|WA Johnston]] 3/15 (13 overs)\n| result = Match drawn\n| venue = [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], [[Sydney]]\n| umpires = [[Andrew Barlow]] (Aus) and [[George Borwick (umpire)|George Borwick]] (Aus)\n| toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n| motm = \n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62677.html Scorecard]\n| rain = Persistent rain led to only one hour of play on day 2 and no play on days 3, 4 and 6.\n| notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[Amir Elahi]] and [[Dattu Phadkar]] (Ind) made their test debuts.\n*''14 December was a [[Glossary of cricket terms#R|rest day]].\n|}}\n\n'''Match Background'''\n\nThis match was marred by rain, as only ten hours of play was possible in six days of play, out of which three days' worth of play was washed out, literally. The rain-affected [[Sticky wicket|\"sticky dog\"]] of a pitch proved terrible for batting, with none of the two teams managing even a score of 200. The Indian team squad changed slightly, fielding two debutants, [[Dattu Phadkar]] and [[Amir Elahi]], replacing KM Rangnekar and Ranga Sohoni, the former going on to make an impressive debut. Australia missed Ernie Toshack due to injury, and this might have made a difference, since Toshack exploited the rain-affected pitch in the first match and could have done so this time around, had he played. However, this match is best remembered for the infamous [[Run out|\"Mankading\"]] incident, in which the Indian bowler, [[Vinoo Mankad]] ran out the Australian batsman [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] for backing up too far, despite being warned in the first test.\n\nHowever, [[Don Bradman]], Bill Brown's captain, defended Mankad's sportsmanship in his [[autobiography]], saying,\n\n\"For the life of me, I can't understand why [the press] questioned his sportsmanship. The laws of cricket make it quite clear that the non-striker must keep within his ground until the ball has been delivered. If not, why is the provision there which enables the bowler to run him out? By backing up too far or too early, the non-striker is very obviously gaining an unfair advantage.\"<ref>[[Vinoo Mankad|Wikipedia article on Vino Mankad]]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mankading.gif|thumb|350px|News report of Bill Brown's runout]]\n\n'''Match Report'''\n\nIndia won the toss this time around, choosing to bat first, and immediately, Australia drew first blood, taking the first wicket of Sarwate while the score was 2, and then the second wicket-this time Mankad, fell at 16. Then after 22 more runs were added, rain interrupted the proceedings, bringing a close to the day's play. The second day started an hour late,  but the Indian batsmen were again facing the brunt of a menacing Australian attack, and could not stitch vital partnerships, except for a noteworthy partnership of 70 between Gogumal Kishenchand, and the debutant Phadkar. Eventually, the Indians folded up for 188.\n\nWhen it was the Australians' turn to bat, the opening pair of Brown and [[Arthur Morris|Morris]] put on a stand of 25, before Brown got Mankaded (Note that the scorecard lists all the victims of mankading as being run out). The third and fourth days' play was washed out, and on the fifth day, the saturated pitch did not help the batsmen much, as Phadkar and [[Vijay Hazare]] made most of the conditions, with Hazare scalping Bradman. Phadkar returned with thrifty figures of 3/14 and Hazare's analysis read 4/29 and Australia's innings wrapped up at 107. However, the Australian captain claimed that, \"The Indians dismissed us too quickly for their own good. They, in turn, had to now face the unpleasant wicket and were immediately in trouble, losing seven wickets for 61 before stumps.\"<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/26/stories/2004092608351800.htm \"A brave beginning\", by Sanjay Rajan, ''Times of India''] originally written on 26 September 2004, retrieved on 13 September 2011</ref>\n\nAt the end of the fifth day, the Australian bowlers, [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] showed that they could exploit the conditions just as well, reducing the Indians to seven down; but with a lead of 142, which was a high target on this wicket, the match seemed set for a thrilling finish. However, rain on the final day dispelled any chances of play.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153879.html Second Test Match Australia v India 1947\u201348</ref>\n\n===3rd Test===\n{{Two-innings cricket match\n| date = 1\u20135 January 1948\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n| team2 = {{cr|IND}}\n\n| score-team1-inns1 = 394 (94.1 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Don Bradman]] 132 (204)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Lala Amarnath]] 4/78 (21 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 291/9[[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|d]] (65 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Vinoo Mankad]] 116 (187)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] 4/59 (14 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 255/4[[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|d]] (65 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Don Bradman]] 127[[not out|*]] (169)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Lala Amarnath]] 3/52 (20 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = 125 (25.7 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2 = [[Gul Mohammad]] 28 (50)\n| wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] 4/35 (5.7 overs)\n| result = Australia won by 233 runs\n| venue =  [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Melbourne]]\n| umpires = [[Andrew Barlow]] (Aus) and [[Herbert Elphinstone]] (Aus)\n| toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n| motm = \n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62678.html Scorecard]\n| notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[Kanwar Rai Singh]] and [[Probir Sen]] (Ind) made their Test debuts.\n*''4 January was a [[Glossary of cricket terms#R|rest day]].\n}}\n\n'''Match Report'''\n\nThe match scheduled to be held in Melbourne was held almost two weeks after the second test in Sydney, was held and the Indians had already shown some fight in the second match and so they did in the third, albeit in the first innings only. The match started off with the Australians winning the toss and choosing to bat first. Immediately, the Indians got a breakthrough in the form of [[Sid Barnes|Barnes']] wicket, bowled by Mankad with the score on 29. Then, [[Arthur Morris]], and [[Don Bradman]] staged a fightback by stitching together a 70-run partnership, before Morris was bowled by [[Lala Amarnath|Amarnath]] for a patient 45 crafted from 123 balls with three fours. Lindsay Hassett entered the fray with the score poised on 99, with his captain, Bradman batting. Hassett was dropped in the slips off [[Vijay Hazare|Vijay Hazare's]] bowling when he was batting on 31. This lapse proved too costly for the Indians, because Hassett and Bradman staged a counterattack on the Indian bowlers with some fast scoring, Wisden's own words, Hassett was \"scored as fast as his partner\", and that, \"...at times runs came at two a minute\". Hassett's was the third wicket to fall, with the scorecard reading 268, gifting Mankad his second scalp. Then Bradman fell to [[Dattu Phadkar|Phadkar]], for 132 scored only off 204 balls at a strike-rate excess of 60. After his dismissal, the wickets were easy to come by, with the last six falling for a mere 105.\n\n[[File:D.G.Bradman.png|thumb|left|Don Bradman tamed the attack with 132 in the first innings and 127* in the second]]\n\nThe Indians stated their first innings well, with Mankad and [[Chandu Sarwate|Sarwate]] putting on 124 for the first wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, dismissed by [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by [[Bruce Dooland]], for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by [[Don Tallon]], the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then [[Hemu Adhikari|Adhikari]] and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.\n\nHowever, there was no reason for him to worry, because he and Morris thoroughly \"mastered\" the attack. They strung together an unbeaten partnership of 223, and while Morris scored at a strike rate of less than 50, Bradman was all speed. He reached his century first and ended up on 127 not out, made only off 169 balls, with a strike rate of more than 75. This meant that for the first time ever in his largely impressive career which had seen him accumulate big numbers, he had scored two centuries in a single test match. Wisden spoke thus:\n\n:Bradman added to his long list of triumphs by hitting a hundred in each innings, the first time he had accomplished the feat in a Test match.\n\nHeavy overnight rain made the pitch responsive to spin and Bradman seizing this opportunity, declared, setting the Indians a target of 337. The Indians fared poorly in the second innings, with only Gul Mohammad and Kanwar Rai Singh making any noteworthy contributions, scoring 28 and 24. Singh stuck around giving a few lust hits here and there, but unfortunately for India, they folded up at 125, a score which seemed probable when they lost half of their side with just 60 runs on the board. Noteworthy performers for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnston, Johnson and Hassett. The Indians had some good individual performances in the form of Mankad and Amarnath, the former putting up a good all-round show, while the latter, picking up a match haul of 7 for 130.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152905.html Third Test Match AUSTRALIA v INDIA 1947\u201348</ref>\n\n===4th Test===\n{{Two-innings cricket match\n|date = 23\u201328 January 1948\n|team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n|team2 = {{cr|IND}}\n|score-team1-inns1 = 674 (151.3 overs)\n|runs-team1-inns1 = [[Don Bradman]] 201 (296)\n|wickets-team1-inns1 = [[CR Rangachari]] 4/141 (41 overs)\n|score-team2-inns1 = 381 (109.1 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns1 = [[Dattu Phadkar]] 123 (284)\n|wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] 4/64 (23.1 overs)\n|score-team2-inns2 = 277 ([[Follow-on|f/o]]) (92.5 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns2 = [[Vijay Hazare]] 145 (372)\n|wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Ray Lindwall]] 7/38 (16.5 overs)\n|result = Australia won by an innings and 16 runs\n|venue =  [[Adelaide Oval]], [[Adelaide]]\n|umpires = [[George Borwick (umpire)|George Borwick]] (Aus) and [[Ron Wright (cricketer)|Ron Wright]] (Aus)\n|toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n|motm =\n|report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62679.html Scorecard]\n|notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[C.

This test was the debut test of future Australian great, [[Neil Harvey]]. The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.\n\nThe other Australian centurion in the previous match, Morris, was the first wicket to fall, bowled by Phadkar when the scorecard read 20. After that, his opening partner, Sid Barnes, and Bradman did not give the Indians a chance and controlled the proceedings from then, putting on 236 runs for the second wicket before Barnes perished for a \"faultless\" 112.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152906.html Fourth Test Match AUSTRALIA V INDIA 1947\u201348</ref> He had not offered a single chance in his entire innings except when on 61, dropped by second slip. Bradman was once again the bane of the Indian bowlers, and he, along with Hassett, the next batsman (who had, incidentally put on another huge partnership with Bradman in the previous test) added 105 runs for the third wicket before Bradman fell to Hazare, for the second time in his test-career, for a masterful and dominant 201 which contained a six and 21 fours. Hassett, and Keith Miller added 142 runs more to the score, by hitting aggressively and freely. During their dominant and fast scoring spree, Hassett, quickly scoured past his highest score of 128 and was well on his way to an excellent and combative 198 before he ran out of partners. The rest of the batting order made 171 runs more for the loss of 6 wickets after Miller's dismissal for the fourth wicket. Australia were finally all out for 674, their highest total in the series.\n\nWhen it was the Indians' turn to bat, they made a shocking start to their innings, losing two wickets for just six runs, but they fought back well from that perilous position, to add 127 more runs, albeit at the cost of three wickets. Their overall position, 5 for 133, was not too encouraging, but Vijay Hazare and Dattu Phadkar added 188 runs for the sixth wicket. Phadkar contributed a fine 123 against an Australian attack that had Lindwall Miller, Johnson and Johnston among others. However, the man who was the centre of attraction was Hazare, who cracked  a classical and orthodox 116 to provide some resistance before the Indian lower-order crumpled, as their last four batsmen totalled only 20 runs. The only other Indian batsmen who really made any impact were Vinoo Mankad, who made 156-ball 49, which spanned 139 minutes-2 hours and 19 minutes, and Lala Amarnath, who hit a fast, 46, only off 47 balls, which had five hits to the fence. However, India succumbed to a strong Australian attack, which bowled them out for 381 \u2013 293 runs behind. It was a staggering margin of lead and [[Follow-on|victories after follow-on were rare]]. The Indians started even worse this time around, losing two wickets quickly for no runs on the board. It was then that Hazare played an innings which made a contemporary daily speak thus:\n\n:\"It didn't matter what the ball was, on or outside the off stump, what its height or pace, it was played with amazing certainty ... It was a display of batsmanship, which has very seldom been equalled, certainly not surpassed and never dwarfed. It was not so much the pace at which the ball travelled. It was the supreme artistry of it all.\"<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/136022.html \"Hazare embodied batsmanship at its flawless best\"] written by Boria Majumdar on 18 December 2004, retrieved on 16 September 2011</ref>\n\nIn fact, the innings was so widely acclaimed that everything else was overshadowed, even Bradman's 201. Hazare later came to recall in an interview that his two centuries in the test were the second most prominent memories of the tour after his wicket of Bradman's in the rain-marred, low scoring Sydney test.\n\nIn another interview with Boria Majumdar in October, noted cricket historian, Hazare claimed that:\n\n:\"Bradman seemed impressed with my batting and we became really close friends since. Some years on, he even found time to write a foreword for my book.\"\n\nThis was an incredible feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was almost as good as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's was said to have enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.\n\nHis effort was backed up by Hemu Adhikari's first half-century of the series, 51. Adhikari lent Hazare valuable support and the two batsmen added 132 runs, but the end came soon enough when the Indian tailenders succumbed to Lindwall's pace, as the last three wickets fell for six runs. Australia inflicted another innings defeat to seal a well-deserved series win, but Hazare emerged with his head held high due to his personal triumph. However, the Australian team was too good for the Indians.\n\n===5th Test===\n{{Two-innings cricket match\n|date = 6\u201310 February 1948\n|team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n|team2 = {{cr|IND}}\n|score-team1-inns1 = 575/8[[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|d]] (128 overs)\n|runs-team1-inns1 = [[Neil Harvey]] 153 (251)\n|wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Vinoo Mankad]] 2/107 (33 overs)\n|score-team2-inns1 = 331 (123 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns1 = [[Vinoo Mankad]] 111 (309)\n|wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]] 3/66 (30 overs)\n|score-team2-inns2 = 67 ([[Follow-on|f/o]]) (24.2 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns2 = [[Hemu Adhikari]] 17 (44)\n|wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]] 3/8 (5.2 overs)\n|result = Australia won by an innings and 177 runs\n|venue =  [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Melbourne]]\n|umpires = [[Andrew Barlow]] (Aus) and [[George Cooper (cricket umpire)|George Cooper]] (Aus)\n|toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n|motm = \n|report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62680.html Scorecard]\n|notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]], [[Sam Loxton]] and [[Doug Ring]] (Aus) made their Test debuts.\n*''8 February was a [[Glossary of cricket terms#R|rest day]].\n|}}\n\n'''Match report'''\n\nThe fifth and the final test match was a dead rubber, ultimately, and this match began with one final opportunity for the Indian team to translate their individual performances into solid teamwork. The Australians on the other hand, had already won two successive matches against the tourists and their team had also gelled as one unit. Not only did their captain, Bradman lead with example, but the other team members also proved themselves equally adept. So this match saw the Indians playing with their honour at stake.\n\nBradman's luck with the coin toss continued in the series, as he won the toss and chose to bat first for the fourth occasion out of five. The Australian openers put on 48 runs before Sid Barnes was run out brilliantly by Adhikari. As usual, Bradman came out to bat at [[Batting order (cricket)|one-down]] and along with Bill Brown, he added 92 runs for the third wicket before something unfortunate for Australia happened. Bradman discovered that he had torn a rib muscle and was unable to play freely, so he retired hurt at 140/1. Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour, twenty-five minute 99, from 216 balls. Again he too was run out, but the other Australian batsmen scored handily. Sam Loxton, making his debut, scored a 155-ball 80, Lindwall, [[Don Tallon|Tallon]](the wicket-keeper), Len Johnson, and Bill Johnston contributed to the huge scoreline.\n\nHowever, the chief honours went to the nineteen-year, four-month old Neil Harvey, who muscled a powerful 153, with one five and eleven fours. He ended the first day on 78, and then hit his century on 7 February 1948. He had been promoted to no.5 in the match and it was effectively a just reward for his promotion. He surpassed Archie Jackson's record of being the youngest centurion for Australia, a record that still stands.<ref>[[Neil Harvey#cite note-wisden-1|Neil Harvey-Wikipedia]]</ref> His innings was absolutely flawless except for a chance which he gave the Indian fielders shortly before he was dismissed.\n\nSarwate fell for the first wicket at 3/1 when the Indians began to bat. However, Mankad and Adhikari batted well to bail India out of the crisis, adding 124 for the second wicket before Adhikari fell for 38, made from 202 balls with a solitary boundary. Fresh from his previous match heroics, Hazare came out to bat with Mankad and they put on 79 before Mankad fell for his second century of the series, a well-crafted, five-hour 111. Then Hazare fell for the fifth wicket after a fine 74. The other batsmen except for Phadkar, who made 56 not out, did not survive much longer, as India's batting yet again folded up for a limp display after a strong revival by Hazare and Mankad. Ultimately, India followed on by 244 runs and this time, in their second innings neither Mankad nor Hazare could save their necks as their batting put up a weak performance to be all out for 67. Adhikari top-scored with 17, but other than his \"resistance\", no other Indian batsmen quite managed to occupy the crease and grind out a draw. The two Australian debutants, Doug Ring and Len Johnson had a field day, picking up twelve wickets between them. While Johnson took 6/74, including 3/8 in the second innings, Ring took 6/120. Johnson went on to play only one more test after that, while Ring went on to become a useful allrounder for the Australian team. This capped a miserable tour for the Indian team, who could, \"with reason, complain of ill-fortune in most of the matches.\"<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152907.html Fifth Test Match-AUSTRALIA v INDIA</ref>\n\n==The Tour==\nThis tour can best be remembered for being India's first tour to Australia and also for being Bradman's last test series at home and his second last series. It was perhaps because of this that it was assumed that the Indians were actually keen to watch Bradman play. Even though India capitulated for scores less than hundred four times on the tour, their batsmen performed well individually. In fact, Dattu Phadkar, who cracked a century in fourth test, and hit three fifties as well, headed the averages. Vijay Hazare became a sensation after his two centuries in the same match. Vinoo Mankad hit two centuries, in the third and fifth tests, however, it was the failure from an experienced campaigner and their team captain Lala Amarnath, which hastened the team's heavy loss.\n\nOn paper, it was a strong Indian team which included the likes of Mankad, Hazare, Amarnath and CS Nayudu. But these players never performed collectively, which was what the Australians did. Don Bradman accumulated runs better than before, and his average in this series of 178.75 was nearly the double of his career average. He was the series' top run-scorer. While ray Lindwall, was the series' highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets. For India, Vijay Hazare scored 429 runs and Lala Amarnath took 13 wickets from six innings. However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman, who could have at least reduced the margins of defeat.\n\nThe Australians, on the other hand coordinated perfectly as a unit: their batsmen piled up big scores and their bowlers ran through the Indian lineup, evident by the fact that the Indians never scored more than 400 in the whole test series.\n\nMoreover, the series also magnified the deficit of a strike bowler in India who could take wickets regularly and could contain the run-flow. Don Bradman noted:\n\n:\"I first saw them play in Adelaide when South Australia were their opponents. I made a century in this match, and in doing so formed the conclusion that our Test team would make a lot of runs against them for two reasons,...Firstly, their bowling, whilst reasonably steady and sound, lacked a really fast bowler, and what is probably more important, a really high-class spinner. Secondly, to my surprise, they were weak in the field.\"\n\nIt was of the opinion that this side was one of India's strongest to play, but Rusi Modi, [[Vijay Merchant]], [[Mushtaq Ali]] and [[Fazal Mahmood]] all missed the tour, which crippled India, because Modi and Merchant were India's most reliable batsmen on all types of pitches and surfaces.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155255.html Wisden Report-AUSTRALIA v INDIA]</ref> They also lost a strike bowler, which Fazal Mahmood would go on to become for Pakistan.\n\nAmarnath's lack of success with the bat (140 runs at 14.00 in 10 innings) was an aberration from his performances in the tour, where he scored 1162 runs at an average of 58.10,<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/f_Indians_Batting.html First-Class Batting and Fielding Records]</ref> and picked up 30 wickets. The 228 he made against Victoria in the tour matches was described as \"one of the greatest ever played\" in Australia, by a recognized member of Bill Woodfull's 1932 Bodyline side, Victor Richardson. His captaincy was also said to have been criticised for the frequent changes he made in the batting order, but all the players were reported to have unanimously agreed that his management was fine. Bradman also had written thus of his captaincy, describing an incident when he was playing for the Australian XI side against India in the first-class matches, when he was batting on 99, and Amarnath brought on Gogumal Kishenchand to bowl.\n\n:\"He had not bowled before and I had no idea what type of bowler he was. It was a shrewd move, as one could have so easily been deceived, but I treated him with the greatest respect until eventually came a single to mid-on and the greatest moment had arrived.\"\n\nHazare, Mankad and Phadkar were given praises by Wisden. Wisden asserted that Mankad proved his credentials as the best allrounder of his generation. His left-arm spin brought him 61 wickets on the tour.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/f_Indians_Bowling.html First-Class bowling Records]</ref> Hazare's achievement of hitting two back-to-back centuries in the Adelaide test was describe as the series' best performances. He was only the second Indian to score 1000 runs on the tour. Dattu Phadkar was hailed as being the \"fastest\" Indian bowler. But his achievement of topping the averages for India with 52.33 was mentioned as being a \"welcome surprise\". His 123 in the fourth test was described as a capital century.\n\nThis series was also one in the line of many memorable tests between India and Australia.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Annual reviews==\n* ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' 1949\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Bill Frindall]], ''The Wisden Book of Test Cricket 1877\u20131978'', Wisden, 1979\n* Chris Harte, ''A History of Australian Cricket'', Andre Deutsch, 1993\n* Ray Robinson, ''On Top Down Under'', Cassell, 1975\n* [[Ramachandra Guha]], ''A Corner of a Foreign Field \u2013 An Indian History of a British Sport'', Picador, 2001\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|India national cricket team in Australia, 1947\u201348}}\n* [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/AUS/1947-48_AUS_India_in_Australia_1947-48.html CricketArchive tour itinerary]\n\n{{International cricket tours of Australia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indian cricket team in Australia in 1947-48}}\n[[Category:1947 in Australian cricket]]\n[[Category:1947 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:1948 in Australian cricket]]\n[[Category:1948 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:Australian cricket seasons from 1945\u201346 to 1969\u201370]]\n[[Category:Indian cricket tours of Australia|1947\u201348]]\n[[Category:International cricket competitions from 1945\u201346 to 1960]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox cricket series\n|series=Indian cricket team in Australia, 1947\u201348\n|date=17 October 1947 \u2013 20 February 1948\n|place=[[Australia]]\n|result=Australia won the 5-Test series 4\u20130\n|team1={{cr|AUS}}\n|team2={{cr|IND}}\n|captain1=[[Don Bradman]]\n|captain2=[[Lala Amarnath]]\n|runs1=[[Don Bradman]] (715)<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html Test Batting and Fielding for Australia]</ref><br />[[Lindsay Hassett]] (332)<br />[[Arthur Morris]] (209)\n|runs2=[[Vijay Hazare]] (429)<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_India_Batting.html Test Batting and Fielding for India]</ref><br />[[Dattu Phadkar]] (314)<br />[[Vinoo Mankad]] (306)\n|wickets1=[[Ray Lindwall]] (18)<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Bowling.html Test Bowling for Australia]</ref><br />[[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] (16)<br />[[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] (16)\n|wickets2=[[Lala Amarnath]] (13)<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_India_Bowling.html Test Bowling for India]</ref><br />[[Vinoo Mankad]] (12)<br />[[Dattu Phadkar]] (8)\n|previous='''First Test Series in Australia'''\n|next=[[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1967-68|1967\u201368 Series]]\n}}\n\nThe [[India national cricket team]] toured Australia in the 1947\u201348 season to play a five-match [[Test cricket|Test]] series against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]].  Australia won the series 4\u20130, with one match drawn.\n\nThis was India's inaugural tour of Australia and it was also the first tour by a team representing the newly independent India.  Independence had been finalised only two months before the tour began.\n\nAs evident from the scoreline, the Australian team greatly outclassed the Indians, who had some good individual performances to their credit. However, they did not put up much resistance as a team, with their batting failing to make any impression on the Australians. The only silver lining for India in terms of match results was their two victories in the First Class Matches.\n\n== Touring party ==\nA sub-committee under the chairmanship of [[Anthony de Mello (cricket administrator)|Anthony de Mello]] was formed to recommend to the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] the India team to tour Australia the following season.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=Indian Cricket Team for Australia, Personnel to be Announced On Mar. 17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-3o-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_EsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4162%2C3971634 |accessdate=15 August 2018 |newspaper=The Indian Express |date=2 March 1947 |page=3}}</ref> The touring party comprising 17 players was announced 17 March 1947.

this match, and they had a below-par win-loss ratio of one win and two losses, both being innings defeats. Australia, though, had a remarkable record in their last ten test series, winning eight of them, and three out of a total three series after the war. Their win-loss record was exemplary as well, winning 29 and losing only 7, out of 45 tests.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/australia/engine/records/team/series_results.html?class=1;id=2;type=team Australia-Records-Test matches-Series results]</ref> However, the Indian team had reason to believe that they could punch above their weight, as they had unearthed in [[Vinoo Mankad]], a talented [[all-rounder]], who had taken 39 wickets in those six matches, and had also scored 516 runs from 11 innings at an average of 46.90, and their captain [[Lala Amarnath]]'s good run with the bat and the emergence of a future batting stalwart for India, Vijay Hazare, made India's prospects look a little brighter. However, Australia's captain, [[Don Bradman]] was a major stumbling block in India's path. At the start of the series his record was: 42 test matches, 5773 runs, Average of 97.84.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/4188.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=cumulative Statistics-Statsguru-DG Bradman]</ref> Worryingly, for the touring side, He had already scored heavily against the Indian attack for the Australian XI outfit against India, an imposing 172. So his presence meant definite trouble for Lala Amarnath's side.\n\n'''Match Report'''\n\nThe Brisbane pitch was quite benign and did not trouble the Australians, who chose to bat first after winning the toss. The Australian top order were in full control of the match from the start, stringing partnerships effectively. Don Bradman scored 185, piling on runs and misery on the Indian bowlers, who toiled in vain on a pitch that did not support them. He anchored partnerships with the other batsmen, and even when he ran out of partners, Wisden noted, \"...but completely demoralised the bowlers by punishing methods which brought runs at a terrific rate.\" his knock contained twenty fours. Australia ended the first day with their scorecard reading: 273/3, and Bradman being unbeaten on 160.\n\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:ErnieToshack.jpg|thumb|right|Ernie Toshack rocked the Indians with match figures of 11/31]] -->\n\nIn the second day, only one hour of play was possible due to rain, and Australia went through the scheduled hour of play without losing a wicket, and adding 36 runs more. Surprisingly, a large attendance of 11,000 people came to watch the day's play. The third day of the match saw yet another burst of rain, which saturated the pitch. Bradman had been dismissed by then for a two-hundred-and-eighty-five-minute vigil that yielded 185 runs, placed Australia on a safe perch at 382 for 8. Realizing that the uncovered pitch could be advantageous for Australia's bowlers, Bradman declared; leaving the Indian side the daunting prospect of negotiating, what, in Wisden's words, was a \"treacherous\" pitch.\n\nThe Indian batsmen, who were accustomed to \"...the fast, hard pitches in their own country...\", could not cope up with the Australian bowling, and especially struggled against the bowling of [[Ernie Toshack]], who exploited the conditions in a versatile manner, and in an extremely short spell of nineteen balls, returned remarkable figures of 5 wickets for a solitary run. The Indians crumbled to 58 all out.\n\nTrailing by 324, the Indians had to climb a mountain to evade a huge innings defeat, but were unable to do so, as none of their batsmen except [[Chandu Sarwate]], offered any resistance. Sarwate, batted for two hours and forty minutes-160 minutes, to graft a determined 26. However, the other Indians again crumbled in the face of some quality pace, again, by Toshack himself (he took 6 wickets for 29 runs), and collapsed to be 98 all out, thus, Australia wrapped up the match, inflicting an innings-and-226-runs drubbing on the Indians. This defeat, Wisden noted could have been confidence-sapping for the Indians.<ref>{{cite web |title=First Test Match, Australia v India 1947-48 |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152904.html |work=Wisden |publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}</ref>\n\n===2nd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 12\u201318 December 1947\n| team1 = {{cr|IND}}\n| team2 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 188 (70 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Dattu Phadkar]] 51 (97)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Colin McCool]] 3/71 (18 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 107 (46.2 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Ron Hamence]] 25 (77)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Vijay Hazare]] 4/29 (13.2 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 61/7 (37 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Lala Amarnath]] 14 (25)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|WA Johnston]] 3/15 (13 overs)\n| result = Match drawn\n| venue = [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], [[Sydney]]\n| umpires = [[Andrew Barlow]] (Aus) and [[George Borwick (umpire)|George Borwick]] (Aus)\n| toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n| motm = \n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62677.html Scorecard]\n| rain = Persistent rain led to only one hour of play on day 2 and no play on days 3, 4 and 6.\n| notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[Amir Elahi]] and [[Dattu Phadkar]] (Ind) made their test debuts.\n*''14 December was a [[Glossary of cricket terms#R|rest day]].\n|}}\n\n'''Match Background'''\n\nThis match was marred by rain, as only ten hours of play was possible in six days of play, out of which three days' worth of play was washed out, literally. The rain-affected [[Sticky wicket|\"sticky dog\"]] of a pitch proved terrible for batting, with none of the two teams managing even a score of 200. The Indian team squad changed slightly, fielding two debutants, [[Dattu Phadkar]] and [[Amir Elahi]], replacing KM Rangnekar and Ranga Sohoni, the former going on to make an impressive debut. Australia missed Ernie Toshack due to injury, and this might have made a difference, since Toshack exploited the rain-affected pitch in the first match and could have done so this time around, had he played. However, this match is best remembered for the infamous [[Run out|\"Mankading\"]] incident, in which the Indian bowler, [[Vinoo Mankad]] ran out the Australian batsman [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] for backing up too far, despite being warned in the first test.\n\nHowever, [[Don Bradman]], Bill Brown's captain, defended Mankad's sportsmanship in his [[autobiography]], saying,\n\n\"For the life of me, I can't understand why [the press] questioned his sportsmanship. The laws of cricket make it quite clear that the non-striker must keep within his ground until the ball has been delivered. If not, why is the provision there which enables the bowler to run him out? By backing up too far or too early, the non-striker is very obviously gaining an unfair advantage.\"<ref>[[Vinoo Mankad|Wikipedia article on Vino Mankad]]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mankading.gif|thumb|350px|News report of Bill Brown's runout]]\n\n'''Match Report'''\n\nIndia won the toss this time around, choosing to bat first, and immediately, Australia drew first blood, taking the first wicket of Sarwate while the score was 2, and then the second wicket-this time Mankad, fell at 16. Then after 22 more runs were added, rain interrupted the proceedings, bringing a close to the day's play. The second day started an hour late,  but the Indian batsmen were again facing the brunt of a menacing Australian attack, and could not stitch vital partnerships, except for a noteworthy partnership of 70 between Gogumal Kishenchand, and the debutant Phadkar. Eventually, the Indians folded up for 188.\n\nWhen it was the Australians' turn to bat, the opening pair of Brown and [[Arthur Morris|Morris]] put on a stand of 25, before Brown got Mankaded (Note that the scorecard lists all the victims of mankading as being run out). The third and fourth days' play was washed out, and on the fifth day, the saturated pitch did not help the batsmen much, as Phadkar and [[Vijay Hazare]] made most of the conditions, with Hazare scalping Bradman. Phadkar returned with thrifty figures of 3/14 and Hazare's analysis read 4/29 and Australia's innings wrapped up at 107.

The match started off with the Australians winning the toss and choosing to bat first. Immediately, the Indians got a breakthrough in the form of [[Sid Barnes|Barnes']] wicket, bowled by Mankad with the score on 29. Then, [[Arthur Morris]], and [[Don Bradman]] staged a fightback by stitching together a 70-run partnership, before Morris was bowled by [[Lala Amarnath|Amarnath]] for a patient 45 crafted from 123 balls with three fours. Lindsay Hassett entered the fray with the score poised on 99, with his captain, Bradman batting. Hassett was dropped in the slips off [[Vijay Hazare|Vijay Hazare's]] bowling when he was batting on 31. This lapse proved too costly for the Indians, because Hassett and Bradman staged a counterattack on the Indian bowlers with some fast scoring, Wisden's own words, Hassett was \"scored as fast as his partner\", and that, \"...at times runs came at two a minute\". Hassett's was the third wicket to fall, with the scorecard reading 268, gifting Mankad his second scalp. Then Bradman fell to [[Dattu Phadkar|Phadkar]], for 132 scored only off 204 balls at a strike-rate excess of 60. After his dismissal, the wickets were easy to come by, with the last six falling for a mere 105.\n\n[[File:D.G.Bradman.png|thumb|left|Don Bradman tamed the attack with 132 in the first innings and 127* in the second]]\n\nThe Indians stated their first innings well, with Mankad and [[Chandu Sarwate|Sarwate]] putting on 124 for the first wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, dismissed by [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by [[Bruce Dooland]], for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by [[Don Tallon]], the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then [[Hemu Adhikari|Adhikari]] and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.\n\nHowever, there was no reason for him to worry, because he and Morris thoroughly \"mastered\" the attack. They strung together an unbeaten partnership of 223, and while Morris scored at a strike rate of less than 50, Bradman was all speed. He reached his century first and ended up on 127 not out, made only off 169 balls, with a strike rate of more than 75. This meant that for the first time ever in his largely impressive career which had seen him accumulate big numbers, he had scored two centuries in a single test match. Wisden spoke thus:\n\n:Bradman added to his long list of triumphs by hitting a hundred in each innings, the first time he had accomplished the feat in a Test match.\n\nHeavy overnight rain made the pitch responsive to spin and Bradman seizing this opportunity, declared, setting the Indians a target of 337. The Indians fared poorly in the second innings, with only Gul Mohammad and Kanwar Rai Singh making any noteworthy contributions, scoring 28 and 24. Singh stuck around giving a few lust hits here and there, but unfortunately for India, they folded up at 125, a score which seemed probable when they lost half of their side with just 60 runs on the board. Noteworthy performers for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnston, Johnson and Hassett. The Indians had some good individual performances in the form of Mankad and Amarnath, the former putting up a good all-round show, while the latter, picking up a match haul of 7 for 130.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152905.html Third Test Match AUSTRALIA v INDIA 1947\u201348</ref>\n\n===4th Test===\n{{Two-innings cricket match\n|date = 23\u201328 January 1948\n|team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n|team2 = {{cr|IND}}\n|score-team1-inns1 = 674 (151.3 overs)\n|runs-team1-inns1 = [[Don Bradman]] 201 (296)\n|wickets-team1-inns1 = [[CR Rangachari]] 4/141 (41 overs)\n|score-team2-inns1 = 381 (109.1 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns1 = [[Dattu Phadkar]] 123 (284)\n|wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] 4/64 (23.1 overs)\n|score-team2-inns2 = 277 ([[Follow-on|f/o]]) (92.5 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns2 = [[Vijay Hazare]] 145 (372)\n|wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Ray Lindwall]] 7/38 (16.5 overs)\n|result = Australia won by an innings and 16 runs\n|venue =  [[Adelaide Oval]], [[Adelaide]]\n|umpires = [[George Borwick (umpire)|George Borwick]] (Aus) and [[Ron Wright (cricketer)|Ron Wright]] (Aus)\n|toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n|motm =\n|report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62679.html Scorecard]\n|notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[C.

This test was the debut test of future Australian great, [[Neil Harvey]]. The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.\n\n\n\nThe other Australian centurion in the previous match, Morris, was the first wicket to fall, bowled by Phadkar when the scorecard read 20. After that, his opening partner, Sid Barnes, and Bradman did not give the Indians a chance and controlled the proceedings from then, putting on 236 runs for the second wicket before Barnes perished for a \"faultless\" 112.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152906.html Fourth Test Match AUSTRALIA V INDIA 1947\u201348</ref> He had not offered a single chance in his entire innings except when on 61, dropped by second slip. Bradman was once again the bane of the Indian bowlers, and he, along with Hassett, the next batsman (who had, incidentally put on another huge partnership with Bradman in the previous test) added 105 runs for the third wicket before Bradman fell to Hazare, for the second time in his test-career, for a masterful and dominant 201 which contained a six and 21 fours. Hassett, and Keith Miller added 142 runs more to the score, by hitting aggressively and freely. During their dominant and fast scoring spree, Hassett, quickly scoured past his highest score of 128 and was well on his way to an excellent and combative 198 before he ran out of partners. The rest of the batting order made 171 runs more for the loss of 6 wickets after Miller's dismissal for the fourth wicket. Australia were finally all out for 674, their highest total in the series.\n\nWhen it was the Indians' turn to bat, they made a shocking start to their innings, losing two wickets for just six runs, but they fought back well from that perilous position, to add 127 more runs, albeit at the cost of three wickets. Their overall position, 5 for 133, was not too encouraging, but Vijay Hazare and Dattu Phadkar added 188 runs for the sixth wicket. Phadkar contributed a fine 123 against an Australian attack that had Lindwall Miller, Johnson and Johnston among others. However, the man who was the centre of attraction was Hazare, who cracked  a classical and orthodox 116 to provide some resistance before the Indian lower-order crumpled, as their last four batsmen totalled only 20 runs. The only other Indian batsmen who really made any impact were Vinoo Mankad, who made 156-ball 49, which spanned 139 minutes-2 hours and 19 minutes, and Lala Amarnath, who hit a fast, 46, only off 47 balls, which had five hits to the fence. However, India succumbed to a strong Australian attack, which bowled them out for 381 \u2013 293 runs behind. It was a staggering margin of lead and [[Follow-on|victories after follow-on were rare]]. The Indians started even worse this time around, losing two wickets quickly for no runs on the board. It was then that Hazare played an innings which made a contemporary daily speak thus:\n\n:\"It didn't matter what the ball was, on or outside the off stump, what its height or pace, it was played with amazing certainty ... It was a display of batsmanship, which has very seldom been equalled, certainly not surpassed and never dwarfed. It was not so much the pace at which the ball travelled. It was the supreme artistry of it all.\"<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/136022.html \"Hazare embodied batsmanship at its flawless best\"] written by Boria Majumdar on 18 December 2004, retrieved on 16 September 2011</ref>\n\nIn fact, the innings was so widely acclaimed that everything else was overshadowed, even Bradman's 201. Hazare later came to recall in an interview that his two centuries in the test were the second most prominent memories of the tour after his wicket of Bradman's in the rain-marred, low scoring Sydney test.\n\nIn another interview with Boria Majumdar in October, noted cricket historian, Hazare claimed that:\n\n:\"Bradman seemed impressed with my batting and we became really close friends since. Some years on, he even found time to write a foreword for my book.\"\n\nThis was an incredible feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was almost as good as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's was said to have enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.\n\nHis effort was backed up by Hemu Adhikari's first half-century of the series, 51. Adhikari lent Hazare valuable support and the two batsmen added 132 runs, but the end came soon enough when the Indian tailenders succumbed to Lindwall's pace, as the last three wickets fell for six runs. Australia inflicted another innings defeat to seal a well-deserved series win, but Hazare emerged with his head held high due to his personal triumph. However, the Australian team was too good for the Indians.\n\n===5th Test===\n{{Two-innings cricket match\n|date = 6\u201310 February 1948\n|team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n|team2 = {{cr|IND}}\n|score-team1-inns1 = 575/8[[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|d]] (128 overs)\n|runs-team1-inns1 = [[Neil Harvey]] 153 (251)\n|wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Vinoo Mankad]] 2/107 (33 overs)\n|score-team2-inns1 = 331 (123 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns1 = [[Vinoo Mankad]] 111 (309)\n|wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]] 3/66 (30 overs)\n|score-team2-inns2 = 67 ([[Follow-on|f/o]]) (24.2 overs)\n|runs-team2-inns2 = [[Hemu Adhikari]] 17 (44)\n|wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]] 3/8 (5.2 overs)\n|result = Australia won by an innings and 177 runs\n|venue =  [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Melbourne]]\n|umpires = [[Andrew Barlow]] (Aus) and [[George Cooper (cricket umpire)|George Cooper]] (Aus)\n|toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n|motm = \n|report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62680.html Scorecard]\n|notes = Eight balls per over.\n*''[[Len Johnson (cricketer)|Len Johnson]], [[Sam Loxton]] and [[Doug Ring]] (Aus) made their Test debuts.\n*''8 February was a [[Glossary of cricket terms#R|rest day]].\n|}}\n\n'''Match report'''\n\nThe fifth and the final test match was a dead rubber, ultimately, and this match began with one final opportunity for the Indian team to translate their individual performances into solid teamwork. The Australians on the other hand, had already won two successive matches against the tourists and their team had also gelled as one unit. Not only did their captain, Bradman lead with example, but the other team members also proved themselves equally adept. So this match saw the Indians playing with their honour at stake.\n\nBradman's luck with the coin toss continued in the series, as he won the toss and chose to bat first for the fourth occasion out of five. The Australian openers put on 48 runs before Sid Barnes was run out brilliantly by Adhikari. As usual, Bradman came out to bat at [[Batting order (cricket)|one-down]] and along with Bill Brown, he added 92 runs for the third wicket before something unfortunate for Australia happened. Bradman discovered that he had torn a rib muscle and was unable to play freely, so he retired hurt at 140/1. Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour, twenty-five minute 99, from 216 balls. Again he too was run out, but the other Australian batsmen scored handily. Sam Loxton, making his debut, scored a 155-ball 80, Lindwall, [[Don Tallon|Tallon]](the wicket-keeper), Len Johnson, and Bill Johnston contributed to the huge scoreline.\n\nHowever, the chief honours went to the nineteen-year, four-month old Neil Harvey, who muscled a powerful 153, with one five and eleven fours. He ended the first day on 78, and then hit his century on 7 February 1948. He had been promoted to no.5 in the match and it was effectively a just reward for his promotion. He surpassed Archie Jackson's record of being the youngest centurion for Australia, a record that still stands.<ref>[[Neil Harvey#cite note-wisden-1|Neil Harvey-Wikipedia]]</ref> His innings was absolutely flawless except for a chance which he gave the Indian fielders shortly before he was dismissed.\n\nSarwate fell for the first wicket at 3/1 when the Indians began to bat. However, Mankad and Adhikari batted well to bail India out of the crisis, adding 124 for the second wicket before Adhikari fell for 38, made from 202 balls with a solitary boundary. Fresh from his previous match heroics, Hazare came out to bat with Mankad and they put on 79 before Mankad fell for his second century of the series, a well-crafted, five-hour 111. Then Hazare fell for the fifth wicket after a fine 74. The other batsmen except for Phadkar, who made 56 not out, did not survive much longer, as India's batting yet again folded up for a limp display after a strong revival by Hazare and Mankad. Ultimately, India followed on by 244 runs and this time, in their second innings neither Mankad nor Hazare could save their necks as their batting put up a weak performance to be all out for 67. Adhikari top-scored with 17, but other than his \"resistance\", no other Indian batsmen quite managed to occupy the crease and grind out a draw. The two Australian debutants, Doug Ring and Len Johnson had a field day, picking up twelve wickets between them. While Johnson took 6/74, including 3/8 in the second innings, Ring took 6/120. Johnson went on to play only one more test after that, while Ring went on to become a useful allrounder for the Australian team. This capped a miserable tour for the Indian team, who could, \"with reason, complain of ill-fortune in most of the matches.\"<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152907.html Fifth Test Match-AUSTRALIA v INDIA</ref>\n\n==The Tour==\nThis tour can best be remembered for being India's first tour to Australia and also for being Bradman's last test series at home and his second last series. It was perhaps because of this that it was assumed that the Indians were actually keen to watch Bradman play. Even though India capitulated for scores less than hundred four times on the tour, their batsmen performed well individually. In fact, Dattu Phadkar, who cracked a century in fourth test, and hit three fifties as well, headed the averages. Vijay Hazare became a sensation after his two centuries in the same match. Vinoo Mankad hit two centuries, in the third and fifth tests, however, it was the failure from an experienced campaigner and their team captain Lala Amarnath, which hastened the team's heavy loss.\n\nOn paper, it was a strong Indian team which included the likes of Mankad, Hazare, Amarnath and CS Nayudu. But these players never performed collectively, which was what the Australians did. Don Bradman accumulated runs better than before, and his average in this series of 178.75 was nearly the double of his career average. He was the series' top run-scorer. While ray Lindwall, was the series' highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets. For India, Vijay Hazare scored 429 runs and Lala Amarnath took 13 wickets from six innings. However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman, who could have at least reduced the margins of defeat.\n\nThe Australians, on the other hand coordinated perfectly as a unit: their batsmen piled up big scores and their bowlers ran through the Indian lineup, evident by the fact that the Indians never scored more than 400 in the whole test series.\n\nMoreover, the series also magnified the deficit of a strike bowler in India who could take wickets regularly and could contain the run-flow. Don Bradman noted:\n\n:\"I first saw them play in Adelaide when South Australia were their opponents. I made a century in this match, and in doing so formed the conclusion that our Test team would make a lot of runs against them for two reasons,...Firstly, their bowling, whilst reasonably steady and sound, lacked a really fast bowler, and what is probably more important, a really high-class spinner. Secondly, to my surprise, they were weak in the field.\"\n\nIt was of the opinion that this side was one of India's strongest to play, but Rusi Modi, [[Vijay Merchant]], [[Mushtaq Ali]] and [[Fazal Mahmood]] all missed the tour, which crippled India, because Modi and Merchant were India's most reliable batsmen on all types of pitches and surfaces.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155255.html Wisden Report-AUSTRALIA v INDIA]</ref> They also lost a strike bowler, which Fazal Mahmood would go on to become for Pakistan.\n\nAmarnath's lack of success with the bat (140 runs at 14.00 in 10 innings) was an aberration from his performances in the tour, where he scored 1162 runs at an average of 58.10,<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/f_Indians_Batting.html First-Class Batting and Fielding Records]</ref> and picked up 30 wickets. The 228 he made against Victoria in the tour matches was described as \"one of the greatest ever played\" in Australia, by a recognized member of Bill Woodfull`s 1932 Bodyline side, Victor Richardson. His captaincy was also said to have been criticised for the frequent changes he made in the batting order, but all the players were reported to have unanimously agreed that his management was fine. Bradman also had written thus of his captaincy, describing an incident when he was playing for the Australian XI side against India in the first-class matches, when he was batting on 99, and Amarnath brought on Gogumal Kishenchand to bowl.\n\n:\"He had not bowled before and I had no idea what type of bowler he was. It was a shrewd move, as one could have so easily been deceived, but I treated him with the greatest respect until eventually came a single to mid-on and the greatest moment had arrived.\"\n\nHazare, Mankad and Phadkar were given praises by Wisden. Wisden asserted that Mankad proved his credentials as the best allrounder of his generation. His left-arm spin brought him 61 wickets on the tour.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/f_Indians_Bowling.html First-Class bowling Records]</ref> Hazare's achievement of hitting two back-to-back centuries in the Adelaide test was describe as the series' best performances. He was only the second Indian to score 1000 runs on the tour. Dattu Phadkar was hailed as being the \"fastest\" Indian bowler. But his achievement of topping the averages for India with 52.33 was mentioned as being a \"welcome surprise\". His 123 in the fourth test was described as a capital century.\n\nThis series was also one in the line of many memorable tests between India and Australia.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Annual reviews==\n* ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' 1949\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Bill Frindall]], ''The Wisden Book of Test Cricket 1877\u20131978'', Wisden, 1979\n* Chris Harte, ''A History of Australian Cricket'', Andre Deutsch, 1993\n* Ray Robinson, ''On Top Down Under'', Cassell, 1975\n* [[Ramachandra Guha]], ''A Corner of a Foreign Field \u2013 An Indian History of a British Sport'', Picador, 2001\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|India national cricket team in Australia, 1947\u201348}}\n* [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/AUS/1947-48_AUS_India_in_Australia_1947-48.html CricketArchive tour itinerary]\n\n{{International cricket tours of Australia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indian cricket team in Australia in 1947-48}}\n[[Category:1947 in Australian cricket]]\n[[Category:1947 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:1948 in Australian cricket]]\n[[Category:1948 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:Australian cricket seasons from 1945\u201346 to 1969\u201370]]\n[[Category:Indian cricket tours of Australia|1947\u201348]]\n[[Category:International cricket competitions from 1945\u201346 to 1960]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix placename links, replaced:Warwick\u2192Warwick,typo(s) fixed: `s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1947%E2%80%9348"}

Both tags have been redesigned completely over time. Between 1994 and 1996, the swing tags had \"To\" and \"From\" blanks in them for use as gifts. Starting in early 1996, the tags include four-line poems related to the Beanie Baby, and a date of birth for the toy.

Ty is the first business to leverage their website to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world's first [[Internet sensation]].<ref name=\"TyWarnerBillionaire\" />\n\n==Notable Beanie Babies==\n===Garcia the bear===\n'''Garcia the bear''' was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to musician [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]] who died in 1995, designed by Nicholas Scarbrough. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The bear was supposedly \"born\" the date that Jerry died (August 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name \"Garcia\" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.  Peace has a peace sign, while Garcia does not.\n\nThe bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peace Mania Magazine |url=http://magazine.peacebears.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104132726/http://magazine.peacebears.com/ |archivedate=November 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Princess the bear===\n[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997.

The Princess Diana Beanie Baby bear was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princess bears were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand. The first shipments are easily identified as \"PVC Princess Bears\" due to the tush tag stating \"P.V.C. Pellets\". The second shipment was during the switch to \"P.E. Pellets\" on the tag in 1998 and are very common. The bears were made in both China and Indonesia.\n\n===Decade the bear===\n'''Decade the bear''' was made in honor of Beanie Babies' 10th anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most ''Decade'' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.  It was made in 2003.\n\n===Tabasco the bull===\nOriginally named '''Tabasco''', after [[Tabasco sauce]], the name was changed to '''Snort''' to avoid trademark infringement. Tabasco has all-red \"feet\", while Snort has all-white ones. The poem stayed the same.\n\n=== Peanut the royal blue elephant===\n'''Peanut the royal blue elephant''' is one of the most notable of all the Beanies. It first started production in 1995 as a royal blue color. Then, Ty noticed that the fabric color was wrong, and that it needed to be a light blue color, so they released a light blue version and stopped releasing the royal blue one. They made the light blue one until its retirement in 1999. Only about 500 of the royal blue version were made and, as a result, these Beanies can go for $1,500 with an original tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|title=How A Blue Elephant Named Peanut Sparked The Beanie Baby Craze|accessdate=31 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123202819/https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|archivedate=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Counterfeit Beanie Babies==\n[[File:Ty copy infringement.jpg|thumb|Ty [[copyright infringement]].

Since the beginning, Beanie Babies have included two tags for identification: a heart-shaped \"swing tag\" at the top, and a fabric \"tush tag\" at the bottom. Both tags have been redesigned completely over time. Between 1994 and 1996, the swing tags had \"To\" and \"From\" blanks in them for use as gifts. Starting in early 1996, the tags include four-line poems related to the Beanie Baby, and a date of birth for the toy.

Ty is the first business to leverage their website to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world's first [[Internet sensation]].<ref name=\"TyWarnerBillionaire\" />\n\n==Notable Beanie Babies==\n===Garcia the bear===\n'''Garcia the bear''' was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to musician [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]] who died in 1995, designed by Nicholas Scarbrough. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The bear was supposedly \"born\" the date that Jerry died (August 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name \"Garcia\" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.  Peace has a peace sign, while Garcia does not.\n\nThe bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peace Mania Magazine |url=http://magazine.peacebears.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104132726/http://magazine.peacebears.com/ |archivedate=November 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Princess the bear===\n[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997.

The Princess Diana Beanie Baby bear was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princess bears were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand. The first shipments are easily identified as \"PVC Princess Bears\" due to the tush tag stating \"P.V.C. Pellets\". The second shipment was during the switch to \"P.E. Pellets\" on the tag in 1998 and are very common. The bears were made in both China and Indonesia.\n\n===Decade the bear===\n'''Decade the bear''' was made in honor of Beanie Babies' 10th anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most ''Decade'' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.  It was made in 2003.\n\n===Tabasco the bull===\nOriginally named '''Tabasco''', after [[Tabasco sauce]], the name was changed to '''Snort''' to avoid trademark infringement. Tabasco has all-red \"feet\", while Snort has all-white ones. The poem stayed the same.\n\n=== Peanut the royal blue elephant===\n'''Peanut the royal blue elephant''' is one of the most notable of all the Beanies. It first started production in 1995 as a royal blue color. Then, Ty noticed that the fabric color was wrong, and that it needed to be a light blue color, so they released a light blue version and stopped releasing the royal blue one. They made the light blue one until its retirement in 1999. Only about 500 of the royal blue version were made and, as a result, these Beanies can go for $1,500 with an original tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|title=How A Blue Elephant Named Peanut Sparked The Beanie Baby Craze|accessdate=31 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123202819/https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|archivedate=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Counterfeit Beanie Babies==\n[[File:Ty copy infringement.jpg|thumb|Ty [[copyright infringement]].

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley. In time despite initial Ottoman resistance, these two communities Kelmendi and Ku\u010di came to form all the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods from Kelmendi or Ku\u010di that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. In 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nThe districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by the Italian and then the Nazi German army to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley. In time despite initial Ottoman resistance, these two communities Kelmendi and Ku\u010di came to form all the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods from Kelmendi or Ku\u010di that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] it is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eights [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. In 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nThe districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by the Italian and then the Nazi German army to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat. They finished last in this leg.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders \n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro|San L\u00e1zaro]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[La Mesilla]] \u2192 [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|\u2014\n|87%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Oaxaca City]] / [[Hierve el Agua]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Tapachula]] \u2192 [[:es:Ciudad Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n|Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]]\n|6\n|88%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 [[Metro Puebla|Puebla]] [[File:Car - The Noun Project.svg|20px]] \u2192 [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Frontera Corozal, Chiapas|Frontera Corozal]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Bethel, El Pet\u00e9n|Bethel]] \u2192 [[Belmopan]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|22\n|\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Tulum]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Belize City]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Caye Caulker]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 Belize City [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|23\n|78%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Palenque]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Belmopan]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] \u2192  [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|33\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 2: Cop\u00e1n Ruinas \u2192 Panama City====\n[[File:Panama 08 2013 Trump Ocean Club Tower 7089.JPG|thumb|[[JW Marriott Panama]], [[Panama City]]]]\nJo & Sam chose to go through [[El Salvador]] to get to [[Nicaragua]]. Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]]. They overtook Jen & Rob, who took a break in [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] and were the last team to arrive at Panama City. \n\nIn Honduras, after buying food at a stop, Michael found that he had lost his money belt containing \u00a31,155, which is more than half their money at the start of the leg.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/sydenham-and-lewisham-couple-testing-their-relationship-by-racing-the-length-of-south-america/ |title=Sydenham and Lewisham couple testing their relationship by racing the length of South America |first=Toby |last=Porter|date= 16 March 2020 |work= London News Online}}</ref> Even though they tried to earn some money at the [[Ballena National Marine Park]], at the end of the leg, Shuntelle & Michael decided to quit the race as they felt they could no longer compete with so little money left.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Pe\u00f1as Blancas District|Pe\u00f1as Blancas]] \u2192 [[Lim\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|\u2014\n|74%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 El Cuco [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|2.5\n|75%\n|-style=background:#ccf\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael{{ref|1|[a]}}\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Comayagua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] \u2192 [[Ballena National Marine Park]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|4.5\n|14%\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[David, Panama|David]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|20\n|60%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Monteverde, Costa Rica|Monteverde]] / [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|21.5\n|74%\n|-\n|}\n<small>{{note|1|Note a}} Shuntelle & Michael withdrew from the race after losing over a thousand pounds.</small>\n\n====Leg 3: Panama City \u2192 Villavieja ====\n[[File:Villavieja, Huila, desierto Tatacoa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Tatacoa Desert]]]]\nThe original destination was to be [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]; however, due to [[2019 Ecuadorian protests|civil unrest]], the checkpoint was moved to the Bethel Hotel near [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] of [[Colombia]].  To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| \u2014\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador, for safety reasons the teams were not allowed to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nBoth Jo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] before travelling to their destination in [[Puno]], which depleted their funds. However, as they did not stop to work along the way, Jo & Sam reached the checkpoint first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at Puno.\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]].

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat.

Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]].

They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]].

To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva.

The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nBoth Jo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] before travelling to their destination in [[Puno]], which depleted their funds. However, as they did not stop to work along the way, Jo & Sam reached the checkpoint first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at Puno.\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.

Although Dom & Lizzie were the last to leave, at the Cafayete bus station, they were informed by a local that there is a direct bus route to [[Corrientes]], which allowed them to catch up with Jo & Sam at Corrientes who had to stay overnight at Salta.
