Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Ratna Asmara, Ali Yugo, and Iscandar Sukarno in Djaoeh di Mata, Peran Pemuda dalam Kebangkitan Film Indonesia, p50.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film]]\nA poor villager, Asrad ([[Ali Joego]]), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her not to return. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

After the end of the [[W\u00fcrm glaciation|last glacial period]], about 10,000 years ago, the Obersee and Untersee still formed a single lake. The [[downward erosion]] of the [[High Rhine]] caused the lake level to gradually sink and a sill, the ''Konstanzer Schwelle'', to emerge.\n\nThe Rhine, the [[Bregenzer Ach]], and the [[Dornbirner Ach]] carry sediments from the [[Alps]] to the lake, thus gradually decreasing the depth and reducing the extension of the lake in the southeast.\n\nIn antiquity the two lakes had different names; later, for reasons which are unknown, they came to have the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were five different local [[time zone]]s around Lake Constance. Constance, belonging to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], adhered to the [[Karlsruhe]] time, Friedrichshafen used the time of the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in Lindau, the Bavarian Munich time was observed, and Bregenz used the Prague time, while the Swiss shore used the Berne time. One would have needed to travel only 46 kilometers to visit five time zones. Given the amount of trade and traffic over Lake Constance, this led to serious confusion. Public clocks in harbors used three different clock faces, depending on the destinations offered by the boat companies. In 1892, all German territories used [[Central European Time|CET]], the Austrian railways introduced CET already in 1891, and Switzerland followed in 1894. Because traffic timetables had not been yet updated, CET became the sole valid time around and on Lake Constance in 1895.<ref>[[:de:F\u00fcnf Ortszeiten am Bodensee|\"F\u00fcnf Ortszeiten am Bodensee\"]] in the German Wikipedia, version used 2018-01-08.</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] was the first to mention the lakes around 43 AD, calling the upper lake ''Lacus Venetus'' and the lower lake ''Lacus Acronius'', the Rhine passing through both. Around 75 AD, The naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] called them both, ''Lacus Raetiae Brigantinus'' after the main Roman town on the lake, ''[[Bregenz|Brigantium]]'' (later Bregenz). This name is associated with the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantii]] who lived here, although it is not clear whether the place was named after the tribe or the inhabitants of the region were named after their main settlement.

This name, which had been attested as early as 1187 in the form ''Lacus Constantiensis'',<ref name=Reitzenstein/> came from the town of Konstanz at the outflow of the Rhine from the Obersee, whose original name, Constantia, was in turn derived from the Roman emperor, [[Constantius Chlorus]] (around 300 AD). Hence the French: ''Lac de Constance'', Italian: ''Lago di Costanza'', Portuguese: ''Lago de Constan\u00e7a'', Spanish: ''Lago de Constanza'', Romanian: ''Lacul Constan\u021ba'', Greek: ''\u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u2013 Limni tis Konstantias''.

Even in Romance-influenced English the name \"Lake Constance\" gained a foothold and was then exported into other languages such as Hebrew: \u05d9\u05de\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05d8\u05e0\u05e5 ''yamat Konstanz'' and Swahili: ''Ziwa la Konstanz''.

However, this assumption was based on an error (similar to that of the [[Teutoburg Forest]] and the [[Taunus]]): the Romans sometimes used the name ''Mare Suebicum'' for the [[Baltic Sea]], not Lake Constance. In times when the Romans had located the so-called \"[[Suebi]]\", then an [[Elbe Germanic tribe]] near a sea, this was understandable. The authors of the [[Early Modern Period]] overlooked this and adopted the name for the largest lake in the middle of the former [[Duchy of Swabia]], which also included parts of today's Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karl Heinz Burmeister |title=Der Bodensee im 16.

The discovery of stone tools ([[microlith]]s) indicate that [[hunters and gatherers]] of the [[Mesolithic]] period (Middle Stone Age, 8,000\u20135,500 BC) frequented the area without settling, however. Only hunting camps have been confirmed. The earliest Neolithic farmers, who belonged to the [[Linear Pottery culture]], also left no traces behind, because the Alpine foreland lay away from the routes along which they had spread during the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Helmut Schlichtherle |title=Pfahlbauten: die fr\u00fche Besiedelung des Alpenvorlandes |magazine=Spektrum der Wissenschaft |volume=1989 |issue=Siedlungen der Steinzeit |publisher=Spektrum-Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany |date=1989 |isbn=3-922508-48-0 |pages=140 ff |language=de}}</ref> This changed only in the middle and late [[Neolithic]] when shore settlements were established, the so-called [[pile dwelling]] and [[wetland settlement]]s, which have now been uncovered mainly on Lake \u00dcberlingen, the [[Constance Hopper]] and on the Obersee. At [[Unteruhldingen]], a pile dwelling village has been reconstructed, and now forms an open air museum.\n\nGrave finds from [[Singen am Hohentwiel]] date to the beginning of the Early [[Bronze Age]] and shore settlements were repeatedly built during the [[Neolithic Period]] and the [[Bronze Age]] (up to 800 BC). During the following [[Iron Age]] the settlement history is interrupted. The settlement of the shore of Lake Constance during the [[Hallstatt period]] is attested by [[grave mounds]], which today are usually found in forests where they have been protected from the destruction by agriculture. Since the late Hallstatt period, the peoples living on Lake Constance are referred to as the [[Celts]]. During the [[La T\u00e8ne period]] from 450 BC, the population density decreases, as can be deduced partly due from the fact that no more grave mounds were built. For the first time, written reports on Lake Constance have survived. Thus, we learn that the [[Helvetians]] settled by the lake in the south, the [[Rhaetians]] in the area of the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and the [[Vindelici]] in the northeast. The most important places on the lake were [[Bregenz]] (Celtic ''Brigantion'') and today's [[Constance]].\n\nIn the course of the Roman [[Augustine Alpine Campaign|Alpine campaign]] of 16/15 BC, the Lake Constance region was integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. During the campaign, there was also supposed to have been a [[Battle of Lake Constance|battle on Lake Constance]]. The geographer, [[Pomponius Mela]], makes the first mention in 43 AD of Lake Constance as two lakes \u2013 the ''Lacus Venetus'' (Upper Lake) and the ''Lacus Acronius'' (Untersee) \u2013 with the Rhine flowing through both. [[Pliny the Elder]] referred to Lake Constance as ''Lacus Brigantinus'' for the first time. The most important Roman site was Bregenz, which soon became subject to Roman municipal law and later became the seat of the Prefect of the Lake Constance fleet. The Romans were also in [[Lindau (Lake Constance)|Lindau]], but settled only on the hills around Lindau as the lakeshore was swampy. Other Roman towns were ''Constantia'' (Constance) and ''Arbor Felix'' ([[Arbon]]).\n\nAfter the borders of the Roman Empire were drawn back to the Rhine boundary in the 3rd century BC, the Alemanni gradually settled on the north shore of Lake Constance and, later, on the south bank as well. After the introduction of [[Christianity]], the cultural significance of the region grew as a result of the founding of [[Reichenau Abbey]] and the [[Bishopric of Constance]]. Under the rule of the [[Hohenstaufen]]s, [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diets]] (''Reichstage'') were held by Lake Constance. In Constance, too, a treaty was drawn up between the Hohenstaufen emperor and the [[Lombard League]]. Lake Constance also played an important role as a trading post for goods being traded between German and Italian states.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], there were various conflicts over the control of the region during the [[Lake War]] (1632\u20131648).\n\nAfter the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798\u20131802), which also affected the region and during which Austrian and French [[flotilla]]s operated on Lake Constance, there was a reorganisation of state relationships.\n\n=== Historical maps ===\n[[File:Lacus Constantiensis 1540.jpg|thumb|1540 map of the Lake Constance region]]\n* 1540: the map ''Lacus Constantiensis'' by [[Johannes Zwick]] and [[Thomas Blarer]] shows topographic names, towns and the Rhine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* 1555: the map of the route of the Rhine (''Rhinelaufkarte'') by [[Caspar Vopel]] includes a topographical map of Lake Constance with its larger towns, the tributaries and the course of the Rhine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* 1633: the Swabian map by [[Johannes Janssonius]], Amsterdam: ''Totius Sveviae novissima tabula'' shows Lake Constance with islands, tributaries, towns and villages.<ref>{{Citation |author=Rolf Zimmermann |title=Am Bodensee |language=de |location=Constance |date=2004 |page=endpaper and 112}}</ref>\n* 1675: The Lake Constance map, ''Lacos Acronianus sive Bodamicus'', by Nikolaus David Hautt based on Andreas Arzet [[Jesuits|SJ]] shows Lake Constance with the adjacent lands.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200109/3191ABE8CDD3DAE528AD6595BF249574AFF08C55.html |title=Der Bodensee (Latin: ''Lacvs Acronianvs siue Bodamicvs'') |type=copper print 38 x 51 cm |publisher=University of Berne |date=1970 |orig-year=1675 |location=Berne, Switzerland |via=[[Europeana]]}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Lake Constance from Winterstaude (East to West).JPG|thumb|Complete lake from the [[Winterstaude]]]]\n\n=== Divisions ===\nLake Constance is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]].

Edition 20.</ref>\n\n=== Emergence and future ===\nThe present-day shape of Lake Constance has resulted from the combination of several factors:\n* The [[tectonic]] Lake Constance Basin between the Alps and the Jura was created in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Tertiary]] periods\n* The current [[Alpine Rhine]] was initially a tributary of the Danube.\n* Over time, the basin was [[stream capture|captured]] by the [[High Rhine]] as a result of [[headward erosion]] ([[fluvial erosion]]).\n** The capture was not always only along the present Rhine valley; [[Lake \u00dcberlingen]] marks part of an older valley course.\n* The river valleys were deepened during several [[cold period]]s by the [[Rhine Glacier]] from the valley of the Alpine Rhine ([[glacial erosion]]).\n* Behind the present impressive traces of the [[W\u00fcrm Ice Age]], the effects of older cold periods can no longer be explored in any detail. Lake Constance now represents, above all, a [[zungenbecken]] or [[glacial lake]] of the W\u00fcrm Glaciation.<ref>quaternary-science.publiss.net/articles/452/download Albert Schreiner: ''Zur Entstehung des Bodenseebeckens'' (Quaternary Science Journal, pdf)</ref>\n* During a later phase of the ice age, only the Obersee was glaciated. As the glacier retreated further, the [[glacial meltwater]]s flowed out of the emerging \u00dcberlingen See through the older more northerly valley into the present High Rhine valley.\n* Due to the advancing headward erosion, the present course of the High Rhine was finally (again) reconnected to Lake Constance.<ref>[http://www.landeskunde-online.de/rhein/bodensee/geologie.htm Geology of Lake Constance] at landeskunde-online.de. Retrieved 31 August 2017.</ref> <!-- It is questionable whether there has ever been an undivided Lake Constance -->\n\nLike any glacial lake, Lake Constance will also silt up by [[sedimentation]]. This process can best be observed at the mouths of the larger rivers, especially that of the Alpine Rhine. The [[silting up]] process is accelerated by ever-increasing erosion by the Rhine and the associated reduction in the level of the lake.\n\n=== Tributaries ===\n[[File:Thurnher Filmproduktion Cinedoku Vorarlberg Rheinregulierung Bodensee.jpg|thumb|The estuary of the Alpine Rhine on Lake Constance]]\nThe main tributary of Lake Constance is the [[Alpine Rhine]]. The Alpine Rhine and the [[Seerhein]] do not mix greatly with the waters of the lake and flow through the lakes along courses that change relatively little. There are also numerous smaller tributaries (236 in all). The most important tributaries of the Obersee are (counterclockwise) the [[Dornbirner Ach]], [[Bregenzer Ach]], [[Leiblach]], [[Argen]], [[Schussen]], [[Rotach (Lake Constance)|Rotach]], [[Linzer Aach|Seefelder Aach]], [[Stockacher Aach]], [[Salmsacher Aach]], the [[Aach (Lake Constance, Arbon)|Aach near Arbon]], [[Steinach (Lake Constance)|Steinach]], [[Goldach (river)|Goldach]] and the [[Old Rhine (Fu\u00dfach)|Old Rhine]]. The outflow of the Obersee is the [[Seerhein]], which in turn is the main tributary of the Untersee. The most important tributary of the Untersee is the [[Radolfzeller Aach]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ The ten biggest tributaries of the Obersee by discharge volume<ref>Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: [http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/8849/jhdt_hochwasser.pdf?command=downloadContent&filename=jhdt_hochwasser.pdf ''Informationen zum Jahrhunderthochwasser 1999.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023235412/http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/8849/jhdt_hochwasser.pdf?command=downloadContent&filename=jhdt_hochwasser.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }} (pdf; 24&nbsp;kB)</ref> with its catchment areas:<ref>Internationale Gew\u00e4sserschutzkommission f\u00fcr den Bodensee (publ.): ''Der Bodensee.

The silting up of the entire Lake Constance is estimated to take another ten to twenty thousand years.\n\n=== Outflows, evaporation, water extraction ===\nThe outflow of the Untersee is the [[High Rhine]] with the [[Rhine Falls]] at [[Schaffhausen]]. Both the average precipitation of 0.45&nbsp;km\u00b3/a and evaporation which averages 0.29&nbsp;km\u00b3/a cause a net change in the level of Lake Constance that is less when compared to the influence of the inflows and outflows.<ref name=\"Gew\u00e4sserschutzkommission\"/> Further quantities of lake water are extracted by municipal waterworks around the lake and the water company of [[Bodensee-Wasserversorgung]].\n\n=== Islands ===\n{{Anchor|Island anchor}}\n[[File:Insel Mainau im Bodensee.jpg|thumb|The island of Mainau]]\n{{Main|List of islands in Lake Constance}}\nIn Lake Constance there are ten [[island]]s that are larger than 2,000&nbsp;m\u00b2.\n\nBy far the largest is the [[island of Reichenau]] in the Untersee, which belongs to the municipality of [[Reichenau (Konstanz)|Reichenau]]. The former [[Reichenau Abbey|abbey of Reichenau]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its three early and highly medieval churches. The island is also known for its intensive cultivation of [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]].\n\nThe island of [[Lindau (island)|Lindau]] is located in the east of the Obersee, and is the second largest island. On it is the old town and main railway station of Lindau.\n\nThe third largest island is [[Mainau]] in the southeast of Lake \u00dcberlingen. The owners, the family of [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte]], have set up the island as a tourist attraction and created botanical gardens and wildlife enclosures.\n\nRelatively large, but uninhabited and inaccessible because of their status as nature reserves, are two islands off the [[Wollmatinger Ried]]: the [[Triboldingerbohl]] which has an area of 13&nbsp;ha and Mittler or Langbohl which is just 3&nbsp;ha in area.\n\nSmaller islands in the Obersee are:\n* Dominican Island (''Dominikanerinsel'') separated by a six-metre-wide ditch from the old town of [[Constance]] which is home to the Steigenberger Hotel (2&nbsp;ha)\n* The tiny island of [[Hoy (Lake Constance)|Hoy]] near Lindau\n* The ten artificial islands on the Rhine Causeway on the Fu\u00dfach side\n* The little island by the port of [[Romanshorn]]\n* The Wollschweininsel (officially '' Wulesaueninsle'') by the Seepark in [[Kreuzlingen]]\n\nIn the Untersee are:\n* the islands of [[Werd (Lake Constance)|Werd]], [[Mittleres Werdli]] and [[Unteres Werdli]] which together form the [[Werd Islands]] group are located at the outflow of the Rhine from the Untersee at Stein am Rhein into the [[High Rhine]].\n* The so-called [[Liebesinsel (Lake Constance)|Liebesinsel]] (\"Love Island\", 0.2&nbsp; [[hectares|ha]]) southwest of the Mettnau peninsula.\n\n=== Peninsulas ===\nIn Lake Constance there are several peninsulas which vary greatly in size:\n* The [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], the largest peninsula, separates the \u00dcberlinger See (Obersee) from the Untersee. It covers an area of 112&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n* The [[Mettnau]] in the Untersee, which extends towards the Island of Reichenau, separates Zeller See in the south from the Markelfinger Winkel in the north. It has a surface area of 1.7&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n* The [[H\u00f6ri (Lake Constance)|H\u00f6ri]], (about 45-square-kilometres) also extends towards the Island of Reichenau, and separates the Zeller See to the north from the Rheinsee to the south.\n* In the southeast, near the mouth of the new Rhine Canal, the [[Rhine Delta (Lake Constance)|Rohrspitz]] juts out about 1.2&nbsp;km into the lake and forms the western perimeter of the Bay of Fu\u00dfach. It has an area of about 50 hectares.\n* The [[Wasserburg (Lake of Constance)|Wasserburg]] peninsula has a castle, Schloss Wasserburg, and the parish church of St. George. The peninsula is on the northeastern shore of the Obersee between the Bay of Nonnenhorn in the west and Bay of Wasserburg in the east. It has an area of 2.3&nbsp;ha and was an island until 1720, when the [[Fugger]]s built a causeway. In March 2009, 27 people lived on the peninsula.\n* The [[Galgeninsel]] (\"Gallows Island\") in the Bay of Reutin is also a peninsula that was formerly an island. It is only 0.16 hectares in area.\n\n=== Shore ===\n[[File:BodenseeSandstrand03.jpg|thumb|Sandy beach at the [[Marienschlucht]]]]\nThe shores of Lake Constance consist mainly of gravel. In some places there are also sandy beaches, such as the [[Rohrspitz]] in the Austrian section of the lake, the [[Langenargen]] and [[Marienschlucht]].\n\nAccording to the data of the International Water Protection Commission for the Lake Constance, the approximate shore length is 273&nbsp;km (see [[Coastline paradox]]). The inflow of water is constantly changing, mainly due to rain and the snow melt in the Alps. Its average surface area is about {{H\u00f6he|395|DE-NN}} (in Switzerland the absolute value is slightly higher in m above sea level). The more or less regular seasonal fluctuations in the water level also lead to slight variations in shore length and differences in the shore zone habitats (depending on high and low water).\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Bodenseesturm.jpg|thumb|Summer storm \u2013 view of the [[Luitpoldkaserne (Lindau)|Luitpold Barracks]] in Lindau]]\nThe climate of the Lake Constance area is characterised by mild temperatures with moderate gradients, thanks to the balancing and retarding effect of the large body of water. However, due to the year-round influence of [[f\u00f6hn]] winds which causes frequent fog in winter and close weather in summer, it is considered a stressful climate.\n[[File:Foehnwind am bodensee.jpg|thumb|left|Waves raised by f\u00f6hn winds on the lake]]\n[[File:BodenseeGefroren.jpg|thumb|Frozen lake surface: skating in the [[Markelfinger Winkel]]]]\nLake Constance is also considered to be a risky and challenging lake for water sports because of the danger of gusty winds which can whip up waves as the weather changes suddenly. The most dangerous wind is the f\u00f6hn, a warm down-slope wind from the Alps, which spreads out across the water, especially through the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and can generate waves several metres high.\n\nSimilarly dangerous for those unfamiliar with the area, are the sudden stormy gusts of wind during summer thunderstorms. They constantly claim victims from the water sports fraternity. During a thunderstorm in July 2006, waves reached heights of up to 3.50 metres.\n\nFor these reasons, there is a storm warning system in all three neighbouring countries. For [[storm warning]] purposes, Lake Constance is divided into three warning regions (west, centre and east). Warnings can be issued for each region independently. A \"high winds\" warning will be issued when [[squall]]s are expected of between 25 and 33&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] or registering [[wind speed|force]] 6 to 8 on the [[Beaufort scale]]. A [[gale warning]] announces the likelihood of gale-force winds, i.e. those at speeds as of 34 knots or more or force 8 on the Beaufort scale. In order to issue these warnings, orange-coloured flashing lights are installed around the lake, which flash at a frequency of 40 times per minute for high winds or 90 times per minute for gales. It can happen that, due to the differently regulated responsibilities and assessments, a gale warning is issued on the Swiss side of the Obersee, but not on the German or Austrian shores, and vice versa. Ships and ferries on Lake Constance indicate a gale warning by hoisting a ''Sturmballon'' (\"storm ball\") up the mast.\n\nA one-hundred year event is the freezing over of Lake Constance, when the Lower Lake, Lake \u00dcberlingen and the Upper Lake are completely frozen over so that people can safely cross the lake on foot. The three last so-called ''Seegfr\u00f6rne'' events were in 1963, 1880 and 1830.\n\nCertain parts of the lake freeze over more frequently, mainly due to their shallow depth of water and shelter, as is the case, for example, of the so-called [[Markelfinger Winkel]] between the municipality of [[Markelfingen]] and the [[Mettnau]] peninsula.\n\n=== International borders ===\n[[File:Lac de constance.jpg|thumb|Lake Constance, seen from a vineyard]]\nThe lake lies where the countries of [[Austria]], [[Germany]], and [[Switzerland]] meet.<ref name=\"Kramsch\">{{cite book |last=Kramsch |first=Olivier Thomas |editor1-last=Brunet-Jailly |editor1-first=E. |title=Border Disputes: A Global Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-61-069024-9 |page=453 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Border_Disputes_A_Global_Encyclopedia_3.html?id=k9g5CgAAQBAJ&q=%22lake+constance%22 |chapter=Austria-Germany-Switzerland: Lake Constance (Konstanz)}}</ref> There is no legally binding agreement as to where the borders lie between the three countries.{{r|Kramsch}}<ref name=\"Kahn 2004\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V01T5VI4nZ4C&pg=PA233 |title=Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen: rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen (\"The German national borders: legal-historical foundations and open legal questions\") |author=Kahn, Daniel-Erasmus |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-16-148403-2}}</ref> However, Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake, Austria is of the opinion that the contentious area belongs to all the states on its banks, which is known as a \"[[condominium (international law)|condominium]]\", and Germany holds an ambiguous opinion.{{r|Kramsch}}<ref>Jennings, Ken (16 June 2014) [http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-06-16/lake-constance-maphead \"The Borderless Black Hole in the Middle of Europe\"] ''[[Conde Nast Traveler]]''</ref> Legal questions pertaining to ship transport and fishing are regulated in separate treaties.\n\nDisputes occasionally arise. One concerns a [[houseboat]] which was moored in two states ([[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] c. 224/97 Erich Ciola); another concerns the rights to fish in the Bay of Bregenz. In relation to the latter, an Austrian family was of the opinion that it alone had the right to fish in broad portions of the bay. However, this was accepted neither by the Austrian courts nor by the organs and courts of the other states.<ref>Mark, David and Smith, Barry, et al., [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//baarle/bizarre_shapes.htm \"Bizarre Shapes: 100 Geographic Monsters\"]</ref>\n\n=== Floods ===\n* A [[100-year flood]] around June 1999 ([[Pfingsthochwasser 1999]]) raised the level about 2 metres above normal, flooding harbors and many shoreline buildings and hotels.\n* In late August 2005, heavy rain raised the level by more than 70&nbsp;cm in a few days.

Since then, nature has been heavily influenced by [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] and the cultivation of much of the land around its shores. However, some near-natural areas have been largely conserved, especially in the nature reserves, or were re-naturalised. As a result, the Lake Constance region has some unusual ecological features. These include the large forested area on the [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], the occurrence of [[marsh gentian]] and [[orchid]]s of the genera ''[[Dactylorhiza]]'' and ''[[Orchis]]'' in the Wollmatinger Ried, and the [[Siberian iris]] (''Iris sibirica'') in the [[Eriskircher Ried]], which was therefore given its own name.<ref name=\"Planet Wissen\">[http://www.planet-wissen.de/natur_technik/fluesse_und_seen/der_bodensee/index.jsp Planet Wissen \u2013 Bodensee]</ref> One unique species among the local flora is the [[Lake Constance forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis rehsteineri''), whose habitat is restricted to undisturbed beaches of lime trees.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Halbinsel Mettnau.JPG|thumb|The Mettnau peninsula]]\nLake Constance is also the home of numerous bird species, many of which nest in its nature reserves, such as the [[Wollmatinger Ried]] or the [[Mettnau]] peninsula. 412 species have so far been recorded.<ref>[http://www.bodensee-ornis.de/informationen-zum-bodensee/beobachtungsgebiete/ Ornithologische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bodensee: Beobachtungsgebiete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919054010/http://www.bodensee-ornis.de/informationen-zum-bodensee/beobachtungsgebiete/ |date=2016-09-19 }}</ref>\n\n===== Songbirds =====\nThe ten most common breeding bird species at Lake Constance according to a 2000\u20132003 survey in descending order are the: [[Common blackbird|blackbird]], [[chaffinch]], [[house sparrow]], [[great tit]], [[Eurasian blackcap|blackcap]], [[starling]], [[European robin|robin]], [[common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]], [[greenfinch]], and [[blue tit]].<ref>''Aufgelistet.

Lake Constance is also very important as a staging post during the [[bird migration]]. Bird migration is often inconspicuous and most noticeable when there are special weather conditions that make day migration obvious. Only where there is a prolonged spell of widespread low-pressure is it common to observe the congestion of large groups of migratory birds. This can often be observed in autumn on the [[Eriskircher Ried]] on the northern shore of Lake Constance. This is where broad front migration converges on the lake and birds then try to move along the shore towards the northwest. The importance of Lake Constance as an important area for resting and overwintering is underlined by the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology's Radolfzell Bird Observatory (''Vogelwarte Radolfzell''), which is the [[bird ringing]] centre for the German states of Bavaria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland as well as for Austria, and which researches bird migration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orn.mpg.de/~vwrado/templates/de/birdrining.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305053525/http://www.orn.mpg.de/~vwrado/templates/de/birdrining.html |archive-date=2007-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Fish ====\nAround 45 species of fish live in Lake Constance.

In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref>\n\nAmong the foreign species of animal in Lake Constance are the [[zebra mussel]] (''Dreissena polymorpha'') which, since the 18th century, has spread from the Black Sea region across most of Europe and was carried into Lake Constance between 1960 and 1965. After a huge increase in numbers during the 1980s in the Rhine and large lakes, this species is now in retreat today. The zebra mussel causes problems because, among other things, it blocks water extraction pipes. In addition, the species can be a disaster for domestic shellfish, because it competes for their food.<ref name=\"Neozoen\">Angela Schneider: ''Drei von vielen, die sich bereits im Bodensee etabliert haben.'' In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref> Today, according to the Institute for Lake Research (''Institut f\u00fcr Seenforschung'', ISF), the zebra mussel is also an important food for overwintering waterfowl. In fact, the number of overwinterers has more than doubled in around 30 years.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\nThe [[killer shrimp]] (''Dikerogammarus villosus'') has spread since 2002 from two sections of shoreline near Hagnau and Immenstaad, over the whole Lake \u00dcberlingen (2004), the whole of the Upper Lake (2006) and almost the whole Lake Constance and Rheinsee shore (2007).<ref>''Invasion des H\u00f6ckerflohkrebses.'' In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref> As its name implies, it is a voracious burglar of fish larvae and fish eggs.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\nThe most recent example is the little [[opossum shrimp]] (''Limnomysis benedeni''), only six to eleven millimeters long, which was found in 2006 in the Vorarlberg region of Hard, and can now be found almost all over Lake Constance.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/> It comes from the waters around the Black Sea. It was presumably first transported by ships up the Danube before it spread into the Rhine river system and entered Lake Constance. The opossum shrimp, which occurs in many places in shoals of several million in winter, are already an influential link in the food chain in Lake Constance. They consume dead animal and plant material as well as [[phytoplankton]], but are also eaten by fish themselves.<ref name = \"Neozoen\"/>\n\nToday, in western Lake Constance are found: the North American [[spinycheek crayfish]] (''Orconectes limosus''), which was introduced into European waters in the mid-19th century to increase the yield,<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\" /> occasionally the [[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis''), and in the lake's tributaries, the [[signal crayfish]] (''Pacifastacus leniusulus''). As these species of large crayfish are immune to [[crayfish plague]], but spread the pathogen, they are a great danger to native species such as [[noble crayfish]], [[white-clawed crayfish]] or [[stone crayfish]]. The animals are often undemanding, multiply rapidly and lead predatory lives, thus also posing a threat to various small species of fish.<ref name=\"Neozoen\"/> The ISF has been systematically researching the subject since 2003.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\n=== Wrecks on the lake bed ===\n<!-- {{main article|Shipwrecks in Lake Constance}} -->\nAfter a collision with the ''[[Stadt Z\u00fcrich (ship, 1855)|Stadt Z\u00fcrich]]'' in 1864 the [[Shipwreck|wreck]] of the ''[[Jura (ship, 1854)|Jura]]'' has lain on the lake bed at a depth of 45 metres off the Swiss shore. In the early 20th century four ships were sunk in the Obersee after being taken out of service: in 1931 the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm (ship, 1871)|Baden]]'', formerly the ''Kaiser Wilhelm'', in 1932 the ''Helvetia'', in 1933 the ''S\u00e4ntis'' and in 1934 the ''Stadt Radolfzell''. The hull of the burnt-out ''[[Friedrichshafen (ship, 1909)|Friedrichshafen]]'' was scuttled in 1944 off the mouth of the [[Argen]] in 100 to 150 metres of water.<ref>Katy Cuko: ''Zwei Schiffswracks im Bodensee gefunden.

Important are especially cities like [[Konstanz]], [[\u00dcberlingen]], [[Meersburg]], [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Lindau]] and [[Bregenz]] as they are the big hubs for boating tourism. The main tourism attractions are places like [[Rhine Falls]], one of the three biggest waterfalls in Europe, the [[Mainau|Mainau Island]] and [[Reichenau Island]] (UNESCO world heritage), the [[\u00dcberlingen|pilgrimage church Birnau]], castles and palaces like [[Salem Abbey]], [[Meersburg Castle]] as well as another UNESCO world heritage site, the [[Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen]] (German for [[Stilt house]] museum) as well as [[Church of St. George, Oberzell, Reichenau]].\n\nThe [[Alps]] reach almost to the east of the lake, producing great scenic beauty. The [[Pf\u00e4nderbahn]] goes from top of the mountain right down, next to the lake in Bregenz.\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nLake Constance is the location for the annual [[Bregenzer Festspiele]], a well-known arts festival that, among other venues, takes place on a floating stage in [[Bregenz]]. The operas, plays and concerts performed are usually popular works, e.g. [[The Magic Flute]] by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] or [[Rigoletto]] by [[Giuseppe Verdi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bregenzerfestspiele.com/en/company/history|title=History of the Bregenz Festival {{!}} Bregenz Festival|website=bregenzerfestspiele.com|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, the ART BODENSEE takes place in [[Dornbirn]].

It brings its visitors to the most interesting sites and goes around the whole lake. Nevertheless, various shortcuts via ferries allow shorter routes and the trail is suitable for all levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodensee-radweg.de/|title=Bodensee-Radweg|website=Bodensee-Radweg|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> Note: There is also a trail that goes by the name \"Bodensee-Rundweg\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fernwege.de/d/bodensee/index.html|title=Wandern rund um den Bodensee|website=www.fernwege.de|access-date=2016-12-30}}</ref> This road was intended for pedestrians so biking is sometimes not suitable or allowed.\n\n=== Hiking and pilgrim trails ===\n[[File:Wegzeichen - Bodensee-Rundweg.svg|thumb|upright|Sign of the \"Lake Constanze circular route\"]]\nThe 260 kilometers long Lake Constance circular route, signposted as \"Bodensee Rundwanderweg\", leads around Lake Constance through the territories of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It is mainly intended for hiking; cyclists follow the sometimes slightly different managed Lake Constance cycle path.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wanderkompass.de/Deutschland/Bodensee-Rundwanderweg.html|title=Bodensee-Rundwanderweg|last=Sven|access-date=2018-02-28|language=de-de}}</ref> The trail can be walked in smaller stages of various lengths and offers nice views of the lake, landscape and wildlife. However, due to industrial settlements, buildings and nature reserves, not all the coastal zones are readily accessible. Furthermore, in the estuary of the rivers, such the [[Leiblach]], [[Bregenzer Ach]], [[Rhine|canalized Rhine]] and [[Alter Rhein|Old Rhine]] ([[Fu\u00dfach|Fu\u00dfacher breakthrough]]), considerable distances have to be covered inland to the next bridge or river crossing point. Due to busy riverside roads, the Bodensee-Rundweg sometimes runs as a trail above the lake with some lookout possibilities.\n\nLake Constance is also a hub for [[Hiking|long-distance hikers]] and pilgrims. It has been a crucial reference point of important [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage routes]] since ancient times:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ueberlingen-bodensee.de/Themen/Aktiv/Wandern-am-Bodensee/Der-Jakobsweg|title=Der Jakobsweg (Pilgrimage trail of St. James) {{!}} Ueberlingen near Lake Constance {{!}}|work=Ueberlingen am Bodensee|access-date=2018-02-28|language=de}}</ref>\n* Via Beuronensis, a [[Way of St. James]] from the [[Neckar]] region over the [[Swabian Jura|Swabian Alb]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.via-beuronensis.de|title=Home \u2013 Startpunkt|website=www.via-beuronensis.de|language=de|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n* the Upper [[Swabian Jura|Swabian]] pilgrimage-route of St. James, which leads from Upper Swabia to the lake and branches north of the lake both in the direction of [[Nonnenhorn]] and in the direction of [[Meersburg]]\n* the bavarian-swabian route of St. James, which leads down from the West [[Allg\u00e4u]] to the lake\n* the Schwabenweg, which ensures the connection to [[Switzerland]] to the lake near [[Konstanz]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jakobsweg.ch/en/eu/ch/routes/constance-einsiedeln-en/|title=Constance-Einsiedeln (Swabian way)|website=Route of St.James|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Swimming ===\n[[Swimming]] in the lake is usually possible from mid-June to mid-September. Depending on the weather, the water temperatures reach {{convert|19| to |25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.

After the end of the [[W\u00fcrm glaciation|last glacial period]], about 10,000 years ago, the Obersee and Untersee still formed a single lake. The [[downward erosion]] of the [[High Rhine]] caused the lake level to gradually sink and a sill, the ''Konstanzer Schwelle'', to emerge.\n\nThe Rhine, the [[Bregenzer Ach]], and the [[Dornbirner Ach]] carry sediments from the [[Alps]] to the lake, thus gradually decreasing the depth and reducing the extension of the lake in the southeast.\n\nIn antiquity the two lakes had different names; later, for reasons which are unknown, they came to have the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were five different local [[time zone]]s around Lake Constance. Constance, belonging to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], adhered to the [[Karlsruhe]] time, Friedrichshafen used the time of the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in Lindau, the Bavarian Munich time was observed, and Bregenz used the Prague time, while the Swiss shore used the Berne time. One would have needed to travel only 46 kilometers to visit five time zones. Given the amount of trade and traffic over Lake Constance, this led to serious confusion. Public clocks in harbors used three different clock faces, depending on the destinations offered by the boat companies. In 1892, all German territories used [[Central European Time|CET]], the Austrian railways introduced CET already in 1891, and Switzerland followed in 1894. Because traffic timetables had not been yet updated, CET became the sole valid time around and on Lake Constance in 1895.<ref>[[:de:F\u00fcnf Ortszeiten am Bodensee|\"F\u00fcnf Ortszeiten am Bodensee\"]] in the German Wikipedia, version used 2018-01-08.</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] was the first to mention the lakes around 43 AD, calling the upper lake ''Lacus Venetus'' and the lower lake ''Lacus Acronius'', the Rhine passing through both. Around 75 AD, The naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] called them both, ''Lacus Raetiae Brigantinus'' after the main Roman town on the lake, ''[[Bregenz|Brigantium]]'' (later Bregenz). This name is associated with the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantii]] who lived here, although it is not clear whether the place was named after the tribe or the inhabitants of the region were named after their main settlement. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] later used the form ''Lacus Brigantiae''.<ref name=Reitzenstein>{{cite book |editor=Wolf-Armin Freiherr von Reitzenstein |title=Lexikon schw\u00e4bischer Ortsnamen.

The name may be linked to that of the [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], the hill range between Lake \u00dcberlingen and the Lower Lake, and the history of the [[House of Bodman]].\n\nThe German name of the lake, ''Bodensee'', has been adopted by many other languages, for example: Dutch: ''Bodenmeer'', Danish: ''Bodens\u00f8en'', Norwegian: ''Bodensj\u00f8en'', Swedish: ''Bodensj\u00f6n'', Icelandic: ''Bodenvatn'', Finnish: ''Bodenj\u00e4rvi'', Estonian: ''Bodeni j\u00e4rv'', Lithuanian: ''Bodeno e\u017eeras'', Latvian: ''Bodenezers'', Russian: ''\u0411\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e'', Polish: ''Jezioro Bode\u0144skie'', Czech: ''Bodamsk\u00e9 jezero'', Slovak: ''Bodamsk\u00e9 jazero'', Hungarian: ''Bodeni-t\u00f3'', Bulgarian: ''\u0411\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e'', Ukrainian: ''\u0411\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e'', Croatian: ''Bodensko jezero'', Albanian: ''Liqeni i Bodenit''.

This name, which had been attested as early as 1187 in the form ''Lacus Constantiensis'',<ref name=Reitzenstein/> came from the town of Konstanz at the outflow of the Rhine from the Obersee, whose original name, Constantia, was in turn derived from the Roman emperor, [[Constantius Chlorus]] (around 300 AD). Hence the French: ''Lac de Constance'', Italian: ''Lago di Costanza'', Portuguese: ''Lago de Constan\u00e7a'', Spanish: ''Lago de Constanza'', Romanian: ''Lacul Constan\u021ba'', Greek: ''\u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u2013 Limni tis Konstantias''. The Arabic, \u0628\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0643\u0648\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0633 ''bu\u0127aira Konstans'' and probably the Turkish, ''Konstanz g\u00f6l\u00fc'', probably go back to the French form of the name. Even in Romance-influenced English the name \"Lake Constance\" gained a foothold and was then exported into other languages such as Hebrew: \u05d9\u05de\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05d8\u05e0\u05e5 ''yamat Konstanz'' and Swahili: ''Ziwa la Konstanz''. In many languages both forms exist in parallel e.g. [[Romansch language|Romansh]]: ''Lai da Constanza'' and ''Lai Bodan'', Esperanto: ''Konstanca Lago'' and ''Bodenlago''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe poetic name, \"[[Swabia]]n Sea\" was adopted by authors of the [[early modern era]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] from ancient authors, possibly [[Tacitus]]. However, this assumption was based on an error (similar to that of the [[Teutoburg Forest]] and the [[Taunus]]): the Romans sometimes used the name ''Mare Suebicum'' for the [[Baltic Sea]], not Lake Constance. In times when the Romans had located the so-called \"[[Suebi]]\", then an [[Elbe Germanic tribe]] near a sea, this was understandable. The authors of the [[Early Modern Period]] overlooked this and adopted the name for the largest lake in the middle of the former [[Duchy of Swabia]], which also included parts of today's Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karl Heinz Burmeister |title=Der Bodensee im 16.

The discovery of stone tools ([[microlith]]s) indicate that [[hunters and gatherers]] of the [[Mesolithic]] period (Middle Stone Age, 8,000-5,500 BC) frequented the area without settling, however. Only hunting camps have been confirmed. The earliest Neolithic farmers, who belonged to the [[Linear Pottery culture]], also left no traces behind, because the Alpine foreland lay away from the routes along which they had spread during the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Helmut Schlichtherle |title=Pfahlbauten: die fr\u00fche Besiedelung des Alpenvorlandes |magazine=Spektrum der Wissenschaft |volume=1989 |issue=Siedlungen der Steinzeit |publisher=Spektrum-Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany |date=1989 |isbn=3-922508-48-0 |pages=140 ff |language=de}}</ref> This changed only in the middle and late [[Neolithic]] when shore settlements were established, the so-called [[pile dwelling]] and [[wetland settlement]]s, which have now been uncovered mainly on Lake \u00dcberlingen, the [[Constance Hopper]] and on the Obersee. At [[Unteruhldingen]], a pile dwelling village has been reconstructed, and now forms an open air museum.\n\nGrave finds from [[Singen am Hohentwiel]] date to the beginning of the Early [[Bronze Age]] and shore settlements were repeatedly built during the [[Neolithic Period]] and the [[Bronze Age]] (up to 800 BC). During the following [[Iron Age]] the settlement history is interrupted. The settlement of the shore of Lake Constance during the [[Hallstatt period]] is attested by [[grave mounds]], which today are usually found in forests where they have been protected from the destruction by agriculture. Since the late Hallstatt period, the peoples living on Lake Constance are referred to as the [[Celts]]. During the [[La T\u00e8ne period]] from 450 BC, the population density decreases, as can be deduced partly due from the fact that no more grave mounds were built. For the first time, written reports on Lake Constance have survived. Thus, we learn that the [[Helvetians]] settled by the lake in the south, the [[Rhaetians]] in the area of the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and the [[Vindelici]] in the northeast. The most important places on the lake were [[Bregenz]] (Celtic ''Brigantion'') and today's [[Constance]].\n\nIn the course of the Roman [[Augustine Alpine Campaign|Alpine campaign]] of 16/15 BC, the Lake Constance region was integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. During the campaign, there was also supposed to have been a [[Battle of Lake Constance|battle on Lake Constance]]. The geographer, [[Pomponius Mela]], makes the first mention in 43 AD of Lake Constance as two lakes - the ''Lacus Venetus'' (Upper Lake) and the ''Lacus Acronius'' (Untersee) - with the Rhine flowing through both. [[Pliny the Elder]] referred to Lake Constance as ''Lacus Brigantinus'' for the first time. The most important Roman site was Bregenz, which soon became subject to Roman municipal law and later became the seat of the Prefect of the Lake Constance fleet. The Romans were also in [[Lindau (Lake Constance)|Lindau]], but settled only on the hills around Lindau as the lakeshore was swampy. Other Roman towns were ''Constantia'' (Constance) and ''Arbor Felix'' ([[Arbon]]).\n\nAfter the borders of the Roman Empire were drawn back to the Rhine boundary in the 3rd century BC, the Alemanni gradually settled on the north shore of Lake Constance and, later, on the south bank as well. After the introduction of [[Christianity]], the cultural significance of the region grew as a result of the founding of [[Reichenau Abbey]] and the [[Bishopric of Constance]]. Under the rule of the [[Hohenstaufen]]s, [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diets]] (''Reichstage'') were held by Lake Constance. In Constance, too, a treaty was drawn up between the Hohenstaufen emperor and the [[Lombard League]]. Lake Constance also played an important role as a trading post for goods being traded between German and Italian states.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], there were various conflicts over the control of the region during the [[Lake War]] (1632-1648).\n\nAfter the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798-1802), which also affected the region and during which Austrian and French [[flotilla]]s operated on Lake Constance, there was a reorganisation of state relationships.\n\n=== Historical maps ===\n[[File:Lacus Constantiensis 1540.jpg|thumb|1540 map of the Lake Constance region]]\n* 1540: the map ''Lacus Constantiensis'' by [[Johannes Zwick]] and [[Thomas Blarer]] shows topographic names, towns and the Rhine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* 1555: the map of the route of the Rhine (''Rhinelaufkarte'') by [[Caspar Vopel]] includes a topographical map of Lake Constance with its larger towns, the tributaries and the course of the Rhine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* 1633: the Swabian map by [[Johannes Janssonius]], Amsterdam: ''Totius Sveviae novissima tabula'' shows Lake Constance with islands, tributaries, towns and villages.<ref>{{Citation |author=Rolf Zimmermann |title=Am Bodensee |language=de |location=Constance |date=2004 |page=endpaper and 112}}</ref>\n* 1675: The Lake Constance map, ''Lacos Acronianus sive Bodamicus'', by Nikolaus David Hautt based on Andreas Arzet [[Jesuits|SJ]] shows Lake Constance with the adjacent lands.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200109/3191ABE8CDD3DAE528AD6595BF249574AFF08C55.html |title=Der Bodensee (Latin: ''Lacvs Acronianvs siue Bodamicvs'') |type=copper print 38 x 51 cm |publisher=University of Berne |date=1970 |orig-year=1675 |location=Berne, Switzerland |via=[[Europeana]]}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Lake Constance from Winterstaude (East to West).JPG|thumb|Complete lake from the [[Winterstaude]]]]\n\n=== Divisions ===\nLake Constance is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]].

Farther west, now in Switzerland, is the Bay of Rorschach. To the north, on the Bavarian side, is the Bay of Reutin. The railway embankment from the mainland to the island of Lindau and the motorway bridge over the lake border the so-called Little Lake (''Kleiner See''), which is located between the Lindau village of Aeschach and the island.\n\nThe northwestern, finger-shaped arm of the Obersee is called \u00dcberlinger See (or \u00dcberlingersee in [[Swiss Standard German]]), or [[Lake \u00dcberlingen]]. It is sometimes regarded as a separate lake, the boundary between Lake \u00dcberlingen and the rest of the Upper Lake runs approximately along the line between the southeast tip of Bodanr\u00fcck (the ''H\u00f6rnle'', which belongs to the town of Konstanz) and Meersburg. The [[Constance Hopper]] lies between the German and Swiss shores east of [[Konstanz]].\n\nThe Obersee and Untersee are connected by the [[Seerhein]].\n\nThe [[Untersee (Lake Constance)|Untersee]], or Lower Lake, which is separated from the Obersee and from its north-west arm, the \u00dcberlinger See, by the large peninsula of [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], has an area of {{convert|63|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is strongly characterised and divided into different areas by [[end moraine]]s, various [[glacial snout]]s and [[medial moraine]]s. These various areas of the lake have their own names. North of [[Reichenau Island]] is the [[Gnadensee]]. West of the island of Reichenau, between the peninsula of [[H\u00f6ri (Lake Constance)|H\u00f6ri]] and the peninsula of [[Mettnau]] is the Zeller See (or Zellersee in Swiss Standard German), or [[Lake Zell]]. North of the peninsula and swamp land Mettnau lies the lake part Markelfinger Winkel. The [[drumlin]]s of the southern Bodanr\u00fcck continue along the bed of these northern parts of the lake. South of the Reichenau, from [[Gottlieben]] to [[Eschenz]], stretches the ''Rheinsee'' (lit.: \"Rhine Lake\") with strong Rhine currents in places. Previously this lake part was named Lake Bernang after the village of [[Berlingen, Switzerland|Berlingen]]. On most of the maps the name of the ''Rheinsee'' is not shown, because this place is best suited for the name of the Untersee.<ref name=\"Seespiegel_20\">[http://www.seespiegel.de/html/archiv/Artikel/Nummer20/1204_002.htm ''Der Bodensee: drei Teile, ein See.''] In: ''Seespiegel.'' Edition 20.</ref>\n\n=== Emergence and future ===\nThe present-day shape of Lake Constance has resulted from the combination of several factors:\n* The [[tectonic]] Lake Constance Basin between the Alps and the Jura was created in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Tertiary]] periods\n* The current [[Alpine Rhine]] was initially a tributary of the Danube.\n* Over time, the basin was [[stream capture|captured]] by the [[High Rhine]] as a result of [[headward erosion]] ([[fluvial erosion]]).\n** The capture was not always only along the present Rhine valley; [[Lake \u00dcberlingen]] marks part of an older valley course.\n* The river valleys were deepened during several [[cold period]]s by the [[Rhine Glacier]] from the valley of the Alpine Rhine ([[glacial erosion]]).\n* Behind the present impressive traces of the [[W\u00fcrm Ice Age]], the effects of older cold periods can no longer be explored in any detail. Lake Constance now represents, above all, a [[zungenbecken]] or [[glacial lake]] of the W\u00fcrm Glaciation.<ref>quaternary-science.publiss.net/articles/452/download Albert Schreiner: ''Zur Entstehung des Bodenseebeckens'' (Quaternary Science Journal, pdf)</ref>\n* During a later phase of the ice age, only the Obersee was glaciated. As the glacier retreated further, the [[glacial meltwater]]s flowed out of the emerging \u00dcberlingen See through the older more northerly valley into the present High Rhine valley.\n* Due to the advancing headward erosion, the present course of the High Rhine was finally (again) reconnected to Lake Constance.<ref>[http://www.landeskunde-online.de/rhein/bodensee/geologie.htm Geology of Lake Constance] at landeskunde-online.de. Retrieved 31 August 2017.</ref> <!-- It is questionable whether there has ever been an undivided Lake Constance -->\n\nLike any glacial lake, Lake Constance will also silt up by [[sedimentation]]. This process can best be observed at the mouths of the larger rivers, especially that of the Alpine Rhine. The [[silting up]] process is accelerated by ever-increasing erosion by the Rhine and the associated reduction in the level of the lake.\n\n=== Tributaries ===\n[[File:Thurnher Filmproduktion Cinedoku Vorarlberg Rheinregulierung Bodensee.jpg|thumb|The estuary of the Alpine Rhine on Lake Constance]]\nThe main tributary of Lake Constance is the [[Alpine Rhine]]. The Alpine Rhine and the [[Seerhein]] do not mix greatly with the waters of the lake and flow through the lakes along courses that change relatively little. There are also numerous smaller tributaries (236 in all). The most important tributaries of the Obersee are (counterclockwise) the [[Dornbirner Ach]], [[Bregenzer Ach]], [[Leiblach]], [[Argen]], [[Schussen]], [[Rotach (Lake Constance)|Rotach]], [[Linzer Aach|Seefelder Aach]], [[Stockacher Aach]], [[Salmsacher Aach]], the [[Aach (Lake Constance, Arbon)|Aach near Arbon]], [[Steinach (Lake Constance)|Steinach]], [[Goldach (river)|Goldach]] and the [[Old Rhine (Fu\u00dfach)|Old Rhine]]. The outflow of the Obersee is the [[Seerhein]], which in turn is the main tributary of the Untersee. The most important tributary of the Untersee is the [[Radolfzeller Aach]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ The ten biggest tributaries of the Obersee by discharge volume<ref>Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: [http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/8849/jhdt_hochwasser.pdf?command=downloadContent&filename=jhdt_hochwasser.pdf ''Informationen zum Jahrhunderthochwasser 1999.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023235412/http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/8849/jhdt_hochwasser.pdf?command=downloadContent&filename=jhdt_hochwasser.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }} (pdf; 24&nbsp;kB)</ref> with its catchment areas:<ref>Internationale Gew\u00e4sserschutzkommission f\u00fcr den Bodensee (publ.): ''Der Bodensee.

The silting up of the entire Lake Constance is estimated to take another ten to twenty thousand years.\n\n=== Outflows, evaporation, water extraction ===\nThe outflow of the Untersee is the [[High Rhine]] with the [[Rhine Falls]] at [[Schaffhausen]]. Both the average precipitation of 0.45&nbsp;km\u00b3/a and evaporation which averages 0.29&nbsp;km\u00b3/a cause a net change in the level of Lake Constance that is less when compared to the influence of the inflows and outflows.<ref name=\"Gew\u00e4sserschutzkommission\"/> Further quantities of lake water are extracted by municipal waterworks around the lake and the water company of [[Bodensee-Wasserversorgung]].\n\n=== Islands ===\n{{Anchor|Island anchor}}\n[[File:Insel Mainau im Bodensee.jpg|thumb|The island of Mainau]]\n{{Main|List of islands in Lake Constance}}\nIn Lake Constance there are ten [[island]]s that are larger than 2,000&nbsp;m\u00b2.\n\nBy far the largest is the [[island of Reichenau]] in the Untersee, which belongs to the municipality of [[Reichenau (Konstanz)|Reichenau]]. The former [[Reichenau Abbey|abbey of Reichenau]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its three early and highly medieval churches. The island is also known for its intensive cultivation of [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]].\n\nThe island of [[Lindau (island)|Lindau]] is located in the east of the Obersee, and is the second largest island. On it is the old town and main railway station of Lindau.\n\nThe third largest island is [[Mainau]] in the southeast of Lake \u00dcberlingen. The owners, the family of [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte]], have set up the island as a tourist attraction and created botanical gardens and wildlife enclosures.\n\nRelatively large, but uninhabited and inaccessible because of their status as nature reserves, are two islands off the [[Wollmatinger Ried]]: the [[Triboldingerbohl]] which has an area of 13&nbsp;ha and Mittler or Langbohl which is just 3&nbsp;ha in area.\n\nSmaller islands in the Obersee are:\n* Dominican Island (''Dominikanerinsel'') separated by a six-metre-wide ditch from the old town of [[Constance]] which is home to the Steigenberger Hotel (2&nbsp;ha)\n* The tiny island of [[Hoy (Lake Constance)|Hoy]] near Lindau\n* The ten artificial islands on the Rhine Causeway on the Fu\u00dfach side\n* The little island by the port of [[Romanshorn]]\n* The Wollschweininsel (officially '' Wulesaueninsle'') by the Seepark in [[Kreuzlingen]]\n\nIn the Untersee are:\n* the islands of [[Werd (Lake Constance)|Werd]], [[Mittleres Werdli]] and [[Unteres Werdli]] which together form the [[Werd Islands]] group are located at the outflow of the Rhine from the Untersee at Stein am Rhein into the [[High Rhine]].\n* The so-called [[Liebesinsel (Lake Constance)|Liebesinsel]] (\"Love Island\", 0.2&nbsp; [[hectares|ha]]) southwest of the Mettnau peninsula.\n\n=== Peninsulas ===\nIn Lake Constance there are several peninsulas which vary greatly in size:\n* The [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], the largest peninsula, separates the \u00dcberlinger See (Obersee) from the Untersee. It covers an area of 112&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n* The [[Mettnau]] in the Untersee, which extends towards the Island of Reichenau, separates Zeller See in the south from the Markelfinger Winkel in the north. It has a surface area of 1.7&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n* The [[H\u00f6ri (Lake Constance)|H\u00f6ri]], (about 45-square-kilometres) also extends towards the Island of Reichenau, and separates the Zeller See to the north from the Rheinsee to the south.\n* In the southeast, near the mouth of the new Rhine Canal, the [[Rhine Delta (Lake Constance)|Rohrspitz]] juts out about 1.2&nbsp;km into the lake and forms the western perimeter of the Bay of Fu\u00dfach. It has an area of about 50 hectares.\n* The [[Wasserburg (Lake of Constance)|Wasserburg]] peninsula has a castle, Schloss Wasserburg, and the parish church of St. George. The peninsula is on the northeastern shore of the Obersee between the Bay of Nonnenhorn in the west and Bay of Wasserburg in the east. It has an area of 2.3&nbsp;ha and was an island until 1720, when the [[Fugger]]s built a causeway. In March 2009, 27 people lived on the peninsula.\n* The [[Galgeninsel]] (\"Gallows Island\") in the Bay of Reutin is also a peninsula that was formerly an island. It is only 0.16 hectares in area.\n\n=== Shore ===\n[[File:BodenseeSandstrand03.jpg|thumb|Sandy beach at the [[Marienschlucht]]]]\nThe shores of Lake Constance consist mainly of gravel. In some places there are also sandy beaches, such as the [[Rohrspitz]] in the Austrian section of the lake, the [[Langenargen]] and [[Marienschlucht]].\n\nAccording to the data of the International Water Protection Commission for the Lake Constance, the approximate shore length is 273&nbsp;km (see [[Coastline paradox]]). The inflow of water is constantly changing, mainly due to rain and the snow melt in the Alps. Its average surface area is about {{H\u00f6he|395|DE-NN}} (in Switzerland the absolute value is slightly higher in m above sea level). The more or less regular seasonal fluctuations in the water level also lead to slight variations in shore length and differences in the shore zone habitats (depending on high and low water).\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Bodenseesturm.jpg|thumb|Summer storm \u2013 view of the [[Luitpoldkaserne (Lindau)|Luitpold Barracks]] in Lindau]]\nThe climate of the Lake Constance area is characterised by mild temperatures with moderate gradients, thanks to the balancing and retarding effect of the large body of water. However, due to the year-round influence of [[f\u00f6hn]] winds which causes frequent fog in winter and close weather in summer, it is considered a stressful climate.\n[[File:Foehnwind am bodensee.jpg|thumb|left|Waves raised by f\u00f6hn winds on the lake]]\n[[File:BodenseeGefroren.jpg|thumb|Frozen lake surface: skating in the [[Markelfinger Winkel]]]]\nLake Constance is also considered to be a risky and challenging lake for water sports because of the danger of gusty winds which can whip up waves as the weather changes suddenly. The most dangerous wind is the f\u00f6hn, a warm down-slope wind from the Alps, which spreads out across the water, especially through the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and can generate waves several metres high.\n\nSimilarly dangerous for those unfamiliar with the area, are the sudden stormy gusts of wind during summer thunderstorms. They constantly claim victims from the water sports fraternity. During a thunderstorm in July 2006, waves reached heights of up to 3.50 metres.\n\nFor these reasons, there is a storm warning system in all three neighbouring countries. For [[storm warning]] purposes, Lake Constance is divided into three warning regions (west, centre and east). Warnings can be issued for each region independently. A \"high winds\" warning will be issued when [[squall]]s are expected of between 25 and 33&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] or registering [[wind speed|force]] 6 to 8 on the [[Beaufort scale]]. A [[gale warning]] announces the likelihood of gale-force winds, i.e. those at speeds as of 34 knots or more or force 8 on the Beaufort scale. In order to issue these warnings, orange-coloured flashing lights are installed around the lake, which flash at a frequency of 40 times per minute for high winds or 90 times per minute for gales. It can happen that, due to the differently regulated responsibilities and assessments, a gale warning is issued on the Swiss side of the Obersee, but not on the German or Austrian shores, and vice versa. Ships and ferries on Lake Constance indicate a gale warning by hoisting a ''Sturmballon'' (\"storm ball\") up the mast.\n\nA one-hundred year event is the freezing over of Lake Constance, when the Lower Lake, Lake \u00dcberlingen and the Upper Lake are completely frozen over so that people can safely cross the lake on foot. The three last so-called ''Seegfr\u00f6rne'' events were in 1963, 1880 and 1830.\n\nCertain parts of the lake freeze over more frequently, mainly due to their shallow depth of water and shelter, as is the case, for example, of the so-called [[Markelfinger Winkel]] between the municipality of [[Markelfingen]] and the [[Mettnau]] peninsula.\n\n=== International borders ===\n[[File:Lac de constance.jpg|thumb|Lake Constance, seen from a vineyard]]\nThe lake lies where the countries of [[Austria]], [[Germany]], and [[Switzerland]] meet.<ref name=\"Kramsch\">{{cite book |last=Kramsch |first=Olivier Thomas |editor1-last=Brunet-Jailly |editor1-first=E. |title=Border Disputes: A Global Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-61-069024-9 |page=453 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Border_Disputes_A_Global_Encyclopedia_3.html?id=k9g5CgAAQBAJ&q=%22lake+constance%22 |chapter=Austria-Germany-Switzerland: Lake Constance (Konstanz)}}</ref> There is no legally binding agreement as to where the borders lie between the three countries.{{r|Kramsch}}<ref name=\"Kahn 2004\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V01T5VI4nZ4C&pg=PA233 |title=Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen: rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen (\"The German national borders: legal-historical foundations and open legal questions\") |author=Kahn, Daniel-Erasmus |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-16-148403-2}}</ref> However, Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake, Austria is of the opinion that the contentious area belongs to all the states on its banks, which is known as a \"[[condominium (international law)|condominium]]\", and Germany holds an ambiguous opinion.{{r|Kramsch}}<ref>Jennings, Ken (16 June 2014) [http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-06-16/lake-constance-maphead \"The Borderless Black Hole in the Middle of Europe\"] ''[[Conde Nast Traveler]]''</ref> Legal questions pertaining to ship transport and fishing are regulated in separate treaties.\n\nDisputes occasionally arise.

Since then, nature has been heavily influenced by [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] and the cultivation of much of the land around its shores. However, some near-natural areas have been largely conserved, especially in the nature reserves, or were re-naturalised. As a result, the Lake Constance region has some unusual ecological features. These include the large forested area on the [[Bodanr\u00fcck]], the occurrence of [[marsh gentian]] and [[orchid]]s of the genera ''[[Dactylorhiza]]'' and ''[[Orchis]]'' in the Wollmatinger Ried, and the [[Siberian iris]] (''Iris sibirica'') in the [[Eriskircher Ried]], which was therefore given its own name.<ref name=\"Planet Wissen\">[http://www.planet-wissen.de/natur_technik/fluesse_und_seen/der_bodensee/index.jsp Planet Wissen \u2013 Bodensee]</ref> One unique species among the local flora is the [[Lake Constance forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis rehsteineri''), whose habitat is restricted to undisturbed beaches of lime trees.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n==== Birds ====\n[[File:Halbinsel Mettnau.JPG|thumb|The Mettnau peninsula]]\nLake Constance is also the home of numerous bird species, many of which nest in its nature reserves, such as the [[Wollmatinger Ried]] or the [[Mettnau]] peninsula. 412 species have so far been recorded.<ref>[http://www.bodensee-ornis.de/informationen-zum-bodensee/beobachtungsgebiete/ Ornithologische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bodensee: Beobachtungsgebiete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919054010/http://www.bodensee-ornis.de/informationen-zum-bodensee/beobachtungsgebiete/ |date=2016-09-19 }}</ref>\n\n===== Songbirds =====\nThe ten most common breeding bird species at Lake Constance according to a 2000-2003 survey in descending order are the: [[Common blackbird|blackbird]], [[chaffinch]], [[house sparrow]], [[great tit]], [[Eurasian blackcap|blackcap]], [[starling]], [[European robin|robin]], [[common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]], [[greenfinch]], and [[blue tit]].<ref>''Aufgelistet.

In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' 8 August 2014, p. 23.</ref>\n\n===== Migration =====\nDuring migration in late autumn there are also numerous [[loon]] on the lake ([[Black-throated loon|black-throated]] and [[red-throated loon]], as well as a few [[great northern diver]]s). Lake Constance is also very important as a staging post during the [[bird migration]]. Bird migration is often inconspicuous and most noticeable when there are special weather conditions that make day migration obvious. Only where there is a prolonged spell of widespread low-pressure is it common to observe the congestion of large groups of migratory birds. This can often be observed in autumn on the [[Eriskircher Ried]] on the northern shore of Lake Constance. This is where broad front migration converges on the lake and birds then try to move along the shore towards the northwest. The importance of Lake Constance as an important area for resting and overwintering is underlined by the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology's Radolfzell Bird Observatory (''Vogelwarte Radolfzell''), which is the [[bird ringing]] centre for the German states of Bavaria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland as well as for Austria, and which researches bird migration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orn.mpg.de/~vwrado/templates/de/birdrining.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305053525/http://www.orn.mpg.de/~vwrado/templates/de/birdrining.html |archive-date=2007-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Fish ====\nAround 45 species of fish live in Lake Constance. The annual haul from fishing is 1.5 million kg. Unusual species occurring here considering the location of the lake are the [[Coregonus|whitefish]] (''Coregonus'' spec.) and the [[Arctic char]] (''Salvelinus alpinus''). Fish that are important for the fishing industry are:\n* [[Bodenseefelchen]] (German: also ''Blaufelchen'', Lat.: ''Coregonus wartmanni'')\n* [[Sandfelchen]] (German: also ''Wei\u00dffelchen'', Lat.: ''Coregonus arenicolus'')\n* [[Gangfisch]] (Lat.: ''Coregonus macrophthalmus'')\n* [[Lake Constance whitefish]] (German: ''Kilch'', Lat.: ''Coregonus gutturosus'')\n* [[Grayling (species)|Grayling]] (German: ''\u00c4sche'', Lat.: ''Thymallus thymallus'')\n* [[European perch|Perch]] (German: ''Flussbarsch, Kretzer, Barschling,'' Swiss German: ''Egli'', Lat.: ''Perca fluviatilis'')\n* [[Common bream|Bream]] (German: ''Brachse'', ''Brasse'', Lat.: ''Abramis brama'')\n* [[Northern pike]] (German: ''Hecht'' (Lat.: ''Esox lucius'')\n* [[Zander]] (Lat.: ''Sander lucioperca'')\n* [[Burbot]] (German: ''Quappe'', ''Tr\u00fcsche'', Lat.: ''Lota lota'')<ref>Source: Who is Who Bodensee 2010/2011 S\u00fcdkurier GmbH Medienhaus</ref>\n* [[European eel|Eel]] (German: ''Aal'', Lat.: ''Anguilla Anguilla'')\n* [[European bullhead|Bullhead]] (German: ''Groppe'', Lat.: ''Cottus gobio'')\n* [[Tench]] (German: ''Schleie'', Lat.: ''Tinca tinca'')\n* [[Wels catfish]] (German: ''Wels'', Lat.: ''Silurus glanis'')\n* [[Salmo trutta lacustris|Lake trout]] (German: ''Seeforelle'', Lat.: ''Salmo trutta lacustris'').\n\nThe Bodenseefelchen (''Coregonus wartmanni''), which was named after Lake Constance due to the great numbers found there, is often prepared whole or as a fillet, in the style of the miller's wife (''nach M\u00fcllerin Art''), in local fish restaurants in a similar way to other trout<ref name=\"Fische\">Themenpark Umwelt des Umweltministeriums Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg \u2013 BodenseeWeb: [http://www.themenpark-umwelt.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/16094/?path=4422;&partId=0&part=15854 Fische]</ref> It is also often served smoked.\n\nThe [[endemism|endemic]] species, formerly found in Lake Constance, the [[Bodensee-Kilch]] (''Coregonus gutturosus'') and [[deepwater char]] (''Salvelinus profundus'') are now assumed to be extinct.<ref>Information board at the harbour in [[Ludwigshafen am Bodensee|Ludwigshafen]] about especially prized Lake Constance fish.</ref>\n\n==== Introduced species ====\nFor many years [[non-native species]] have settled in the Lake Constance ecosystem and, in some cases, endangered or threatened native flora and fauna. At Lake Constance, non-native species have been increasing annually. Several have been transported from other waterbodies as 'blind passengers' on the outside of boats, life jackets, anchor chains or ropes or diving gear.<ref name=\"Friedrich W. Strub 2016\">Friedrich W. Strub: ''Tierische Neuank\u00f6mmlinge im Bodensee.'' In: S\u00fcdkurier dated 20 April 2016.</ref> Others have immigrated from the [[Black Sea]] or the [[Danube]] since the opening of the [[Main-Danube Canal]]. Others have been deliberately introduced.<ref name=\"Anna-Maria Schneider 2015\">Anna-Maria Schneider: ''Die heimliche Invasion unter Wasser.'' In: S\u00fcdkurier date 8 September 2015.</ref>\n\n===== Well-known non-native species =====\nEven the [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') is not a native fish. It was introduced into Lake Constance around 1880 for economic reasons to enhance the local fauna.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\">Angela Schneider: ''Gepanzerte Truppe erobert den Bodensee.'' In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref>\n\nAmong the foreign species of animal in Lake Constance are the [[zebra mussel]] (''Dreissena polymorpha'') which, since the 18th century, has spread from the Black Sea region across most of Europe and was carried into Lake Constance between 1960 and 1965. After a huge increase in numbers during the 1980s in the Rhine and large lakes, this species is now in retreat today. The zebra mussel causes problems because, among other things, it blocks water extraction pipes. In addition, the species can be a disaster for domestic shellfish, because it competes for their food.<ref name=\"Neozoen\">Angela Schneider: ''Drei von vielen, die sich bereits im Bodensee etabliert haben.'' In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref> Today, according to the Institute for Lake Research (''Institut f\u00fcr Seenforschung'', ISF), the zebra mussel is also an important food for overwintering waterfowl. In fact, the number of overwinterers has more than doubled in around 30 years.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\nThe [[killer shrimp]] (''Dikerogammarus villosus'') has spread since 2002 from two sections of shoreline near Hagnau and Immenstaad, over the whole Lake \u00dcberlingen (2004), the whole of the Upper Lake (2006) and almost the whole Lake Constance and Rheinsee shore (2007).<ref>''Invasion des H\u00f6ckerflohkrebses.'' In: ''S\u00fcdkurier.'' dated 9 October 2010.</ref> As its name implies, it is a voracious burglar of fish larvae and fish eggs.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\nThe most recent example is the little [[opossum shrimp]] (''Limnomysis benedeni''), only six to eleven millimeters long, which was found in 2006 in the Vorarlberg region of Hard, and can now be found almost all over Lake Constance.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/> It comes from the waters around the Black Sea. It was presumably first transported by ships up the Danube before it spread into the Rhine river system and entered Lake Constance. The opossum shrimp, which occurs in many places in shoals of several million in winter, are already an influential link in the food chain in Lake Constance. They consume dead animal and plant material as well as [[phytoplankton]], but are also eaten by fish themselves.<ref name = \"Neozoen\"/>\n\nToday, in western Lake Constance are found: the North American [[spinycheek crayfish]] (''Orconectes limosus''), which was introduced into European waters in the mid-19th century to increase the yield,<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\" /> occasionally the [[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis''), and in the lake's tributaries, the [[signal crayfish]] (''Pacifastacus leniusulus''). As these species of large crayfish are immune to [[crayfish plague]], but spread the pathogen, they are a great danger to native species such as [[noble crayfish]], [[white-clawed crayfish]] or [[stone crayfish]]. The animals are often undemanding, multiply rapidly and lead predatory lives, thus also posing a threat to various small species of fish.<ref name=\"Neozoen\"/> The ISF has been systematically researching the subject since 2003.<ref name=\"Eingewanderte Arten\"/>\n\n=== Wrecks on the lake bed ===\n<!-- {{main article|Shipwrecks in Lake Constance}} -->\nAfter a collision with the ''[[Stadt Z\u00fcrich (ship, 1855)|Stadt Z\u00fcrich]]'' in 1864 the [[Shipwreck|wreck]] of the ''[[Jura (ship, 1854)|Jura]]'' has lain on the lake bed at a depth of 45 metres off the Swiss shore. In the early 20th century four ships were sunk in the Obersee after being taken out of service: in 1931 the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm (ship, 1871)|Baden]]'', formerly the ''Kaiser Wilhelm'', in 1932 the ''Helvetia'', in 1933 the ''S\u00e4ntis'' and in 1934 the ''Stadt Radolfzell''. The hull of the burnt-out ''[[Friedrichshafen (ship, 1909)|Friedrichshafen]]'' was scuttled in 1944 off the mouth of the [[Argen]] in 100 to 150 metres of water.<ref>Katy Cuko: ''Zwei Schiffswracks im Bodensee gefunden.

Important are especially cities like [[Konstanz]], [[\u00dcberlingen]], [[Meersburg]], [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Lindau]] and [[Bregenz]] as they are the big hubs for boating tourism. The main tourism attractions are places like [[Rhine Falls]], one of the three biggest waterfalls in Europe, the [[Mainau|Mainau Island]] and [[Reichenau Island]] (UNESCO world heritage), the [[\u00dcberlingen|pilgrimage church Birnau]], castles and palaces like [[Salem Abbey]], [[Meersburg Castle]] as well as another UNESCO world heritage site, the [[Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen]] (German for [[Stilt house]] museum) as well as [[Church of St. George, Oberzell, Reichenau]].\n\nThe [[Alps]] reach almost to the east of the lake, producing great scenic beauty. The [[Pf\u00e4nderbahn]] goes from top of the mountain right down, next to the lake in Bregenz.\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nLake Constance is the location for the annual [[Bregenzer Festspiele]], a well-known arts festival that, among other venues, takes place on a floating stage in [[Bregenz]].

However, due to industrial settlements, buildings and nature reserves, not all the coastal zones are readily accessible. Furthermore, in the estuary of the rivers, such the [[Leiblach]], [[Bregenzer Ach]], [[Rhine|canalized Rhine]] and [[Alter Rhein|Old Rhine]] ([[Fu\u00dfach|Fu\u00dfacher breakthrough]]), considerable distances have to be covered inland to the next bridge or river crossing point. Due to busy riverside roads, the Bodensee-Rundweg sometimes runs as a trail above the lake with some lookout possibilities.\n\nLake Constance is also a hub for [[Hiking|long-distance hikers]] and pilgrims.

Finkel returned to full-time ring announcing at [[Royal Rumble 1996]].\n\n===Storylines===\nAs an announcer, Finkel was generally separate from the scripted [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]], but occasionally he became part of the company's storylines. In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase eventually helped Hennig win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who regularly complained about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]]. On August 26, during the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown]],'' Jericho encouraged Finkel to attack SmackDown announcer [[Tony Chimel]] and take back his place as lead announcer. Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair. Several weeks later, Finkel adopted the role of '''El Dopo''', a masked referee who unfairly officiated a Shamrock match, awarding the win to [[Curtis Hughes]].<ref name=\"Obsessed with wrestling\">{{cite web|first=|last=|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/h/howard-finkel.php|title=Howard's Obsessed with wrestling profile and El Dopo|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Obsessedwithwrestling.com}}</ref> On the October 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jericho defeated Hughes with help from Finkel, but [[slavery|gave]] Finkel to Curtis Hughes after the match.<ref name=\"Resutls smackdown 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |title=Smackdown Results:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012210933/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref> Four days later on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Hughes bet and lost Finkel in a game of poker, to [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]].<ref name=\"Results RAW 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=Raw:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn an August 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Finkel turned heel and began a brief feud with ''Raw'' ring announcer [[Lilian Garcia]] over the lead spot, before both were attacked by [[3-Minute Warning]].<ref name=\"lillian 1\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020805.html|title=Howard Finkel wants his job back|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref> The following week, Garcia defeated Finkel in an evening gown/tuxedo match with help from [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Stacy Keibler]], who were insulted by a remark made by Finkel.<ref name=\"lillian 2\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020826.html|title=Howard Finkel vs Lillian|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132020===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2018}}\nBy 2000, Howard Finkel had taken a lighter schedule with the additions of [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Tony Chimel]] to Raw and SmackDown, respectively, but he still announced for some of the WWF/E's pay-per-view events.\n\nBy 2006, Finkel was rarely heard from even at pay-per-view wrestling events.

The beleaguered state of the Buffalo Public Schools was the dominant topic in the second debate, with Tolbert elaborating on his earlier position regarding mayoral involvement in the school board by proposing that three of the nine school board members, as well as the school superintendent, be appointed directly by the mayor, while Rodriguez repeated his earlier call for direct mayoral control of the schools. Brown, for his part, touted his success in restoring music programs to Buffalo city schools as well as the hiring of more school security officers.<ref name=Kingston/> In addition, the Brown administration's record on economic development was attacked by both challengers, with Brown's boasts of $1.7 billion in development projects currently underway in the city<ref name=Kingston/> countered by Tolbert's criticism that Brown allowed the Buffalo Economic Renaissance Corporation to fold under his watch, as well as his characterization of economic development in Buffalo as concentrated in downtown at the expense of the neighborhoods. As well, Rodriguez cited statistics showing that Buffalo's employment base has been reduced by 10,000 people since Brown took office in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.wbfo.org/post/mayoral-candidates-hold-second-debate |title= Mayoral candidates hold second debate|last=Desmond|first=Mike|date=August 22, 2013|work=WBFO|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe third and final mayoral debate was held on August 27, 2013 at [[WNED-TV]] studios.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wkbw.com/news/local/Buffalo-Mayoral-Candidates-Face-Off-in-Debate-221421021.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130901065633/http://www.wkbw.com/news/local/Buffalo-Mayoral-Candidates-Face-Off-in-Debate-221421021.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 1, 2013|title=Buffalo Mayoral Candidates Face Off in Debate|date=August 27, 2013|work=WKBW|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> The candidates reiterated the points covered in the first two debates on police department staffing issues, unemployment,<ref name=Terreri2/> economic development, and problems in the Buffalo Public Schools.<ref name=Bedenko/> On the subject of crime, both Rodriguez and Tolbert derided Brown's use of [[gun buyback program]]s as a remedy for crime, with Tolbert characterizing the buybacks as \"stunts\".<ref name=Bedenko/> Also in the third debate, Tolbert was put on the defensive when he was asked about a sexual harassment lawsuit that had been filed against him while he was an executive at the National Basketball Association,<ref name=Terreri2/> while Brown was compelled to deny reports that his administration was rewarding campaign donors with patronage jobs as a ''[[quid pro quo]]''<ref name=Bedenko/> and described a lawsuit filed against the city by a housing development company alleging a pay-to-play policy for awarding contracts as \"baseless\" and \"absolute nonsense\".<ref name=Terreri2/>\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n=== Campaigning ===\n\nThough praised for his experience in crimefighting and community service and his \"straight-shooting vibe\", Tolbert was criticized for waiting until relatively late in the election to announce his candidacy,<ref name=\"Esmonde\"/> spending many months courting potential backers and conspicuously attending community events as speculation grew, but not establishing a campaign finance committee until April 2<ref name=\"McCarthy2\"/> nor officially entering the race until May 11.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nIn the run-up to the primary, a [[Siena College]] poll commissioned by the ''Buffalo News'' and [[WGRZ]]-TV and conducted between August 11 and 13, 2013<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/buffalo/buffalo-newswgrz-poll-shows-strong-support-for-buffalo-mayor-byron-w-brown-20130817|title= Buffalo News/WGRZ poll shows strong support for Buffalo Mayor Byron W.

Brown, for his part, touted his success in restoring music programs to Buffalo city schools as well as the hiring of more school security officers.<ref name=Kingston/> In addition, the Brown administration's record on economic development was attacked by both challengers, with Brown's boasts of $1.7 billion in development projects currently underway in the city<ref name=Kingston/> countered by Tolbert's criticism that Brown allowed the Buffalo Economic Renaissance Corporation to fold under his watch, as well as his characterization of economic development in Buffalo as concentrated in downtown at the expense of the neighborhoods.
