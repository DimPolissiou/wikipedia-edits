It is located on the Bandhavgarh hill, rising 811 meters above sea level at the centre of the [[Bandhavgarh National Park]]. It  is surrounded by many smaller hills separated by gently sloping valleys. These valleys end in small, swampy meadows, locally known as 'bohera'. The fort is also home to many of the endangered species of Vulture in India.\n\n==Origin==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nNo records are available to show when Bandhavgarh fort was constructed. It is thought, however, to be some 2000 years old, and there are references to it in the ancient books, the \"Narad-Panch Ratra\" and the \"[[Shiva]] [[Purana]]\". Regional folklore suggests that Bandhavgarh Fort was constructed by rulers of the [[Gondwana (India)|Gond Empire]]. Gond kings of the Pandro caste are the original builders of this fort, and descendants of Gond kings still live near the fort. Gond kings constructed  12 ''talab'' ponds, of which only few remain. This fort's construction and architecture are similar to other forts built by Gond Kings.\n\nThe ''Vanganga'' stream originates from Bandhavgarh Fort's hill. In [[Gondi language]], ''van'' means surname and ''ganga'' loosely translates to a pure stream. That may suggest that ''Pandro'', the surname of Gond kings, may have originated from \"Vanganga\" .{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Bandhavgarh fort derives its name from the most prominent hillock of the area, which is said to be given by [[Lord Rama]] to his brother [[Lakshmana]] to keep watch on [[Lanka]]. Hence the name Bandhavgarh (''bandhav'' as brother, ''garh'' as fort).\n\nBandhavgarh Fort was the business centre for the traders traveling between [[Kosambi|Kaushambi]] and [[Bharhut]], at that time known as Bardawati (Bhaudhya root). During the [[Kalachuri dynasty]] it was called \"Haihay Kshetra\". The [[Vakataka dynasty]] used this place, and various stone writings are found written by them. They made the place livable by cutting stones. There are some ruins found of the Fort in the Bamania Hill near Bandhavgarh, and there are many sculptures and coins found in the nearby villages near Bandhavgarh, Bijhariya, Mala which prove the economical and artistic situation of the kingdom. In the reign on Karan Deo (Vikram Samvat 1245-1260), Bandhavgarh was the capital of the southern part of the [[Gahora]] kingdom.\n \nThere are a few statues depicting the reincarnations of Vishnu (''avatar'') - like one of the Fish and another of the Turtle. There are some remaining ponds on the hill e.g. ''Rani Talab''(Queen's Pond). There is a viewpoint on the hill called ''Suicide point'', from which if one is lucky one can see the vultures in flight.\n\nOne the way back from the fort one can see a gigantic idol of Vishnu lying down, it is also known as ''Sesh Shai''. The word Bandhavgarh means the Fort of Laxman, and the stone carved ''Shesh Shai'' also provides further evidence for the origin of this name.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nVarious dynasties have ruled the fort: for example, [[Mauryan]]s from the 3rd century BC, [[Vakataka]] rulers from the 3rd-5th century, [[Sengar]]s from the 5th century, and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuris]] from 10th century. In the 13th century, the Baghels took over, ruling from Bandhavgarh until 1617, when Maharaja Vikramaditya Singh moved his capital to [[Rewa, India|Rewa]]. The last inhabitants deserted the fort in 1935.\n\nThroughout the tour of Bandhavgarh fort, wildlife such as tigers, cubs, and deer can be seen. In addition, many rare species of birds like Malabar pied hornbill, falcons, 4 species of vultures, and tortoises swimming can also be seen. At some point one can also see vulture nests from above. The hilltop is considered best for photography of flying birds due to the advantage of being positioned at the top. This makes the Bandhavgarh fort a worthwhile addition to a [[Bandhavgarh National Park]] wildlife tour.\n\nAs of approximately 2012, it is no longer possible to visit Bandhavgarh fort, as the M.P. Forest Department is no longer granting anyone permission to do so.  Only the large Vishnu statue at the base of the fort can be visited at present.\n\n==References==\n*L.K.Chaudhari & Safi Akhtar Khan: Bandhavgarh-Fort of the Tiger, Wild Atlas Books, Bhopal, 2003\n*Shahbaz Ahmad: Charger the long living Tiger, Print World, Allahabad, 2001\n*W.A.Rodgers, H.S.Panwar and V.B.Mathur: Wildlife Protected Area Network in India: A review, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, 2000\n*gulzar singh markam: gondwana ke garh darshan, bhopal, 2005\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Forts in India}}\n{{Forts in Madhya Pradesh}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Madhya Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Umaria]]\n[[Category:Places in the Ramayana]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox military installation\n|name = Bandhavgarh Fort\n|partof = [[Bandhavgarh National Park]]\n|location = [[Umaria district]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|image = [[File:Fort Bandhavgarh National Park Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|220px]]\n|caption = Madhya Pradesh\n|map_type=India Madhya Pradesh\n|map_size = 300\n|map_caption = Shown within [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|type = Hill fort\n|coordinates = {{coord|23|40|58.96|N|81|2|7.49|E|region:IN}}\n|built = 10th Century  \n|builder = \n|materials = Stone\n|height = {{convert|811|m|ft}}\n|used =  \n|demolished =\n|condition = Dilapidated \n|ownership = Government of India\n|open_to_public = no\n|garrison = \n|current_commander = \n|commanders =\n|occupants = \n|battles = \n|events = \n|image2 = \n|caption2 = \n}}\nThe '''Bandhavgarh Fort''' is situated in [[Bandhavgarh]] in [[Umaria]] district of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].

{"title_page": "Promiscuity", "text_new": "{{redirect|Promiscuous}}\n'''Promiscuity''' is the practice of engaging in [[sexual activity]] frequently with different [[Sexual partner|partners]] or being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Promiscuous - definition of promiscuous by the Free Online Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/promiscuous|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> The term can carry a moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the [[one-night stand]], and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity.<ref>{{cite web|title=UK's most promiscuous city in 'one night stand' poll revealed|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/08/liverpool-named-uks-most-promiscuous-city-in-one-night-stand-poll-4254176/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited|date=2014-01-08}}</ref>\n\nWhat sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures, as does the prevalence of promiscuity. Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statutes. [[Feminism|Feminists]] have traditionally argued a significant [[double standard]] exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity. Historically, stereotypes of the promiscuous woman have tended to be pejorative, such as \"the [[slut]]\" or \"the harlot\", while male stereotypes have been more varied, some expressing approval, such as \"the stud\" or \"the player\", while others imply societal deviance, such as \"the womanizer\" or \"the philanderer\". A scientific study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are both prone to derogatory judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Michael | last2 = Fraley | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The Sexual Double Standard: Fact or Fiction? | url = | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 52 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 175\u2013186 | doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1293-5}}</ref>\n\nPromiscuity is common in many animal species.<ref name=\"Barash Lipton 2001\"/> Some species have promiscuous [[mating system]]s, ranging from [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable [[pair bond]]s, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. In [[biology]], incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called [[extra-pair copulations]].\n\n==Humans==\nAccurately assessing people's [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] is difficult, since strong social and personal motivations occur, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity.\n\nAmerican experiments in 1978 and 1982 found the great majority of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness, women responded with shock and disgust.<ref name=\"clarkhatfield1989\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf | title=Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers | author1=Clark, Russell D.

A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above. About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19374216|title=Average man sleeps with 7 women - Health - Sexual health - NBC News|work=NBC News}}</ref> Studies of the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s consistently demonstrate a small percentage of the studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the [[epidemiology]] of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random with sexual partners from throughout a population or [[assortative mixing|within their social groups]].\n\nA 2006 [[systematic review]] analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as number of sexual partners, and sexual-health status.

Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statutes. [[Feminism|Feminists]] have traditionally argued a significant [[double standard]] exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity. Historically, stereotypes of the promiscuous woman have tended to be pejorative, such as \"the [[slut]]\" or \"the harlot\", while male stereotypes have been more varied, some expressing approval, such as \"the stud\" or \"the player\", while others imply societal deviance, such as \"the womanizer\" or \"the philanderer\". A scientific study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are both prone to derogatory judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Michael | last2 = Fraley | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The Sexual Double Standard: Fact or Fiction? | url = | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 52 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 175\u2013186 | doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1293-5}}</ref>\n\nPromiscuity is common in many animal species.<ref name=\"Barash Lipton 2001\"/> Some species have promiscuous [[mating system]]s, ranging from [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] to mating systems with no stable relationships where mating between two individuals is a one-time event. Many species form stable [[pair bond]]s, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. In [[biology]], incidents of promiscuity in species that form pair bonds are usually called [[extra-pair copulations]].\n\n==Humans==\nAccurately assessing people's [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] is difficult, since strong social and personal motivations occur, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity.\n\nAmerican experiments in 1978 and 1982 found the great majority of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness, women responded with shock and disgust.<ref name=\"clarkhatfield1989\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf | title=Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers | author1=Clark, Russell D.

A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above. About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19374216|title=Average man sleeps with 7 women - Health - Sexual health - NBC News|work=NBC News}}</ref> Studies of the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s consistently demonstrate a small percentage of the studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the [[epidemiology]] of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random with sexual partners from throughout a population or [[assortative mixing|within their social groups]].\n\nA 2006 [[systematic review]] analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as number of sexual partners, and sexual-health status.

Shafaq's family includes her father Atta, her mother Naheed and her brother Kamran. Kamran is engaged to his cousin Iram. Shafaq's family also has a close relationship with Naheed's sister (Shafaq and Kamran's aunt) and her son Hassan. Hassan likes Shafaq but is never able to tell anyone. \n\nShafaq is kind-hearted and loved by everyone and quite rich, whereas, Anji is poor and greedy. Also, she takes pleasure by troubling others. She considers herself to be the prettiest woman on earth. She flirts with a waiter and constantly eats free food from his restaurant and takes a lot of money from him along with his jewelry. She flirts with a nearby grocery store owner and buys all the ration and luxury items for free. She constantly demands gifts and pizzas from a married neighbor. She befriends Shafaq just because of her money, because innocent Shafaq gifts her expensive things and also pays for her at the canteen always.\n\nAnji soon understands that she can get easily rich if she marries Shafaq's brother, Kamran so she cleverly starts luring him and his family and flirting with him. Kamran is already engaged to his childhood fianc\u00e9e, and cousin, Iram, who is very kind and loving and is very close to Shafaq also. But still, Kamran falls into Anji's trap but Shafaq's father gets to know of it and quickly calls Iram to their house and tells her the whole situation and asks her to be alert and handle the situation. Anji is also very smart and she makes Shafaq start to hate Iram and trouble her and throw her out of the house. Soon, due to Iram's efforts and wisdom, Kamran soon understands Anji's true colours but still they're not able to make Shafaq know about Anji's truth. Iram and Kamran marry.\n\nAnji repeatedly provokes Shafaq to take her revenge on Iram, and then marries an orphan boy of a well-to-do family in Lahore. \n\n===Two years later===\n\nAftab tries to be a good husband to Anji but Anji is always rude to him. She doesn't look after her two children, Bunto and Munni. Her Bua (maid) is taking care of the entire house. \n\nShafaq also marries Azir and they shift to Lahore. The friends reunite in Lahore and seeing Azir richer and more handsome than her own husband, she gets so jealous of Shafaq that she tries to break her marriage. She tries hard to lure her husband and she is successful in doing so. Azir kicks Shafaq out of his own house in front of Anji. At the same time, Irum shows up and she takes Shafaq with her to Karachi.\n\nAfter coming to Karachi Shafaq becomes pregnant with Azir's child. Irum tries to tell Azar the truth about Anji and also tells him about his upcoming baby. But he heard nothing and said he would only come to take his baby. Azar tells this to the good news, but Angie tells him that Shafaq is lying because if this were true then Shafaq would tell you herself.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sanam Chaudhry]] as Anjum/Anji\n*[[Aiman Khan]] as Shafaq\n*[[Shahzad Shaikh]] as Aazir\n*[[Ali Abbas (actor)|Ali Abbas]] as Kamran (Erum's husband and Shafaq's brother)\n*[[Yashma Gill]] as Erum (Kamran's wife)\n*[[Ali Ansari (actor)|Ali Ansari]] as Aftab (Anjum's husband)\n*Humera Bano as Razia (Anji's mother)\n*[[Mariam Mirza|Maryam Mirza]] as Naheed (Shafaq's mother)\n*Shajeer ud din as Atta (Shafaq's father)\n*Barjees Farooqui as Simi (Shafaq's aunt)\n*Mabsira Khan as Shahida (Erum's mother)\n*Ramsha Akmal as Lubna (Anjum's younger sister)\n*[[Mizna Waqas]] as Faakhira (Anjum's elder sister)\n*Arsalan Raja as Hassaan\n*[[Seemi Pasha]] as Aazir's mother\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ghar Titli Ka Par OST\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Sahir Ali Bagga]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|12|22}}\n| recorded   = 2017\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Television soundtrack]]\n| length     = (5:22)\n| language   = [[Urdu]]\n| label      = [[Geo Entertainment]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{Youtube|SwTqBilGf-I|\"Ghar Titli Ka Par\" OST}}|type=song}}\n}}\n\nThe title song was sung by [[Sahir Ali Bagga]] and has more than 3 million views on [[YouTube]].

Shafaq's family includes her father Atta, her mother Naheed and her brother Kamran. Kamran is engaged to his cousin Iram. Shafaq's family also has a close relationship with Naheed's sister (Shafaq and Kamran's aunt) and her son Hassan. Hassan likes Shafaq but is never able to tell anyone. \n\nShafaq is kind-hearted and loved by everyone and quite rich, whereas, Anji is poor and greedy. Also, she takes pleasure by troubling others. She considers herself to be the prettiest woman on earth. She flirts with a waiter and constantly eats free food from his restaurant and takes a lot of money from him along with his jewelry. She flirts with a nearby grocery store owner and buys all the ration and luxury items for free. She constantly demands gifts and pizzas from a married neighbor. She befriends Shafaq just because of her money, because innocent Shafaq gifts her expensive things and also pays for her at the canteen always.\n\nAnji soon understands that she can get easily rich if she marries Shafaq's brother, Kamran so she cleverly starts luring him and his family and flirting with him. Kamran is already engaged to his childhood fianc\u00e9e, and cousin, Iram, who is very kind and loving and is very close to Shafaq also. But still, Kamran falls into Anji's trap but Shafaq's father gets to know of it and quickly calls Iram to their house and tells her the whole situation and asks her to be alert and handle the situation. Anji is also very smart and she makes Shafaq start to hate Iram and trouble her and throw her out of the house. Soon, due to Iram's efforts and wisdom, Kamran soon understands Anji's true colours but still they're not able to make Shafaq know about Anji's truth. Iram and Kamran marry.\n\nAnji repeatedly provokes Shafaq to take her revenge on Iram, and then marries an orphan boy of a well-to-do family in Lahore. \n\n===Two years later===\n\nAftab tries to be a good husband to Anji but Anji is always rude to him. She doesn't look after her two children, Bunto and Munni. Her Bua (maid) is taking care of the entire house. \n\nShafaq also marries Azir and they shift to Lahore. The friends reunite in Lahore and seeing Azir richer and more handsome than her own husband, she gets so jealous of Shafaq that she tries to break her marriage. She tries hard to lure her husband and she is successful in doing so. Azir kicks Shafaq out of his own house in front of Anji. At the same time, Irum shows up and she takes Shafaq with her to Karachi.\n\nAfter coming to Karachi Shafaq becomes pregnant with Azir's child. Irum tries to tell Azar the truth about Anji and also tells him about his upcoming baby. But he heard nothing and said he would only come to take his baby. Azar tells this to the good news, but Angie tells him that Shafaq is lying because if this were true then Shafaq would tell you herself.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sanam Chaudhry]] as Anjum/Anji\n*[[Aiman Khan]] as Shafaq\n*[[Shahzad Shaikh]] as Aazir\n*[[Ali Abbas (actor)|Ali Abbas]] as Kamran (Erum's husband and Shafaq's brother)\n*[[Yashma Gill]] as Erum (Kamran's wife)\n*[[Ali Ansari (actor)|Ali Ansari]] as Aftab (Anjum's husband)\n*Humera Bano as Razia (Anji's mother)\n*[[Mariam Mirza|Maryam Mirza]] as Naheed (Shafaq's mother)\n*Shajeer ud din as Atta (Shafaq's father)\n*Barjees Farooqui as Simi (Shafaq's aunt)\n*Mabsira Khan as Shahida (Erum's mother)\n*Ramsha Akmal as Lubna (Anjum's younger sister)\n*[[Mizna Waqas]] as Faakhira (Anjum's elder sister)\n*Arsalan Raja as Hassaan\n*[[Seemi Pasha]] as Aazir's mother\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ghar Titli Ka Par OST\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Sahir Ali Bagga]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|12|22}}\n| recorded   = 2017\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Television soundtrack]]\n| length     = (5:22)\n| language   = [[Urdu]]\n| label      = [[Geo Entertainment]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{Youtube|SwTqBilGf-I|\"Ghar Titli Ka Par\" OST}}|type=song}}\n}}\n\nThe title song was sung by [[Sahir Ali Bagga]] and has more than 3 million views on [[YouTube]].
