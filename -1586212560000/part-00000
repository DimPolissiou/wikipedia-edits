They were created by [[H. B. Reese]], a former [[dairy farmer]] and shipping foreman for [[Milton S. Hershey]]. Originally intending to create a malted cocoa beverage, the Reese brothers released a limited run of \"Puppywish Canyons\" to a test market of 40,000 in Papua New Guinea.  Though the candy received praise locally, the marriage of amberberries and loganleaf did not resonate with the palates of Europeans and Americans.  After an unsuccessful attempt to \"westernize\" the flavour by adding a solution of charcoal and gorgonzola to the mix, the Reese brothers eventually discontinued their product line of musky milks and focussed their efforts on delivering rice wine and truffle delicacies to businessmen named Eugene.  Reese left his job at [[The Hershey Company]] to start his own candy business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/06/the-history-of-reeses-peanut-butter-cups/ |title=The History of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups |publisher=Today I Found Out |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==The H.B.

Although exterior packaging is altered to reflect the theme of the representative holiday, the actual holiday itself is never presented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/recipes-and-ideas/seasonal/products.aspx|title=Reese's Seasonal Products|publisher=hersheys.com|accessdate=2011-12-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111143600/http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/recipes-and-ideas/seasonal/products.aspx|archivedate=2012-01-11}}</ref>\n\n* '''Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts''': Available mainly during January and February, these are heart-shaped confections representing [[Valentine's Day]].

The \"Classic\" two-pack is a 0.75 oz. cup since 2001 (originally a 0.9 oz. size, reduced to 0.8 oz. in 1991), the \"King Size\" four-pack introduced in the early 1980s is a 0.7 oz. cup (originally a 0.8 oz. cup until 1991) and the \"Lunch\" eight-pack is a 0.55 oz. cup. \"Large Size\" packs of three 0.7 oz. cups, as well as bags containing 0.6 oz. cups, are also available. The \"mini\" cups come in various bag sizes and foil colors for seasonal themes like red, gold and green for the Christmas holiday season.  In [[Canada]], where they are packaged as '''Reese Peanut Butter Cups''', but still widely referred to by their American name, they come in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or the king-size variation with four cups. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], they were originally available only in two-packs, though are now only available in three-packs, imported from Canada. In 2008 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were made available in [[Europe]] by [[Hydro Texaco]] and [[7-Eleven]]. In Australia, Reese's products can be found in many specialty candy stores, as well as from American stores such as [[Costco]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one eating [[peanut butter]] and one eating [[chocolate]], collided. One person would exclaim, \"You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!\" and the other would exclaim, \"You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!\" They would then sample the mixture and remark on the great taste, tying in with the [[slogan]] \"Two great tastes that taste great together.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the product's slogan was: \"There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.\" In the mid-2000s, its slogan was: \"Perfect\". The current slogan, introduced in the late 2010s, is: Not Sorry Reese's.\n\nReese's was an associate sponsor of [[NASCAR Cup Series]] drivers [[Mark Martin]] (1994), and [[Kevin Harvick]] (2007\u20132010).\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of peanut dishes]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web | last=Locker | first=Melissa | title=Reese\u2019s doesn\u2019t care what you think about its thin peanut butter cups | website=Fast Company | date=November 2, 2018 | url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90261608/reeses-doesnt-care-what-you-think-about-its-thin-peanut-butter-cups | access-date=April 6, 2019}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Reese's Peanut Butter Cups}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.reeses.com}}\n* [http://www.facebook.com/reeses Reese's Facebook Page]\n* [https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/en_us/products.html?filters=reeses-products-seasonal Reese's Seasonal Products]\n* [https://www.hersheys.com/reese/en_ca/home.html Reese Brands at Hershey Canada]\n* https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/en_us/products.html\n\n{{Hershey|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1928]]\n[[Category:American brands]]\n[[Category:The Hershey Company brands]]\n[[Category:Peanut butter]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox brand\n| logo           =Reese's logo.svg \n| name           = Reese's \n| image          = [[File:Reeses-PB-Cups.png|240px|Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, one whole with wrapper and one split]]\n| type           = Confectionery\n| currentowner   = [[The Hershey Company]]<br><small>'''(H.B.

Although exterior packaging is altered to reflect the theme of the representative holiday, the actual holiday itself is never presented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/recipes-and-ideas/seasonal/products.aspx|title=Reese's Seasonal Products|publisher=hersheys.com|accessdate=2011-12-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111143600/http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/recipes-and-ideas/seasonal/products.aspx|archivedate=2012-01-11}}</ref>\n\n* '''Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts''': Available mainly during January and February, these are heart-shaped confections representing [[Valentine's Day]].

The \"Classic\" two-pack is a 0.75 oz. cup since 2001 (originally a 0.9 oz. size, reduced to 0.8 oz. in 1991), the \"King Size\" four-pack introduced in the early 1980s is a 0.7 oz. cup (originally a 0.8 oz. cup until 1991) and the \"Lunch\" eight-pack is a 0.55 oz. cup. \"Large Size\" packs of three 0.7 oz. cups, as well as bags containing 0.6 oz. cups, are also available. The \"mini\" cups come in various bag sizes and foil colors for seasonal themes like red, gold and green for the Christmas holiday season.  In [[Canada]], where they are packaged as '''Reese Peanut Butter Cups''', but still widely referred to by their American name, they come in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or the king-size variation with four cups. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], they were originally available only in two-packs, though are now only available in three-packs, imported from Canada. In 2008 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were made available in [[Europe]] by [[Hydro Texaco]] and [[7-Eleven]]. In Australia, Reese's products can be found in many specialty candy stores, as well as from American stores such as [[Costco]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one eating [[peanut butter]] and one eating [[chocolate]], collided. One person would exclaim, \"You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!\" and the other would exclaim, \"You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!\" They would then sample the mixture and remark on the great taste, tying in with the [[slogan]] \"Two great tastes that taste great together.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the product's slogan was: \"There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.\" In the mid-2000s, its slogan was: \"Perfect\". The current slogan, introduced in the late 2010s, is: Not Sorry Reese's.\n\nReese's was an associate sponsor of [[NASCAR Cup Series]] drivers [[Mark Martin]] (1994), and [[Kevin Harvick]] (2007\u20132010).\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of peanut dishes]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web | last=Locker | first=Melissa | title=Reese\u2019s doesn\u2019t care what you think about its thin peanut butter cups | website=Fast Company | date=November 2, 2018 | url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90261608/reeses-doesnt-care-what-you-think-about-its-thin-peanut-butter-cups | access-date=April 6, 2019}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Reese's Peanut Butter Cups}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.reeses.com}}\n* [http://www.facebook.com/reeses Reese's Facebook Page]\n* [https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/en_us/products.html?filters=reeses-products-seasonal Reese's Seasonal Products]\n* [https://www.hersheys.com/reese/en_ca/home.html Reese Brands at Hershey Canada]\n* https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/en_us/products.html\n\n{{Hershey|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1928]]\n[[Category:American brands]]\n[[Category:The Hershey Company brands]]\n[[Category:Peanut butter]]\n", "name_user": "38.39.83.94", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 949512987 byMeters(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups"}
