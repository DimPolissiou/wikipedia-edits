Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\n\n== History ==\nDietzenbach had its first documentary mention about 1210 in a donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route. Dietzenbach moreover has at its disposal its own town bus network with a central bus station at the ''Dietzenbach Mitte'' S-Bahn station. Bus lines which cross Dietzenbach are the town lines OF-56 and 57, the county lines OF95, 96, 97 and 99 as well as night line n71.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon there's an one hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees fahrenheit (22 degrees celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of the nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and range lands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a lomg traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing. \n\n== History ==\nDietzenbach had its first documentary mention about 1210 in a donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

He began playing music as a small child. As a teenager growing up near Gainesville, Lynch determined that he would find a way to make a living with music. \"As a kid I had very little opportunity. I was a marginal student. I wasn't going to college. My parents didn't have money.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n\"I played guitar and piano, and I always thought I was going to be a guitar player,\" said Lynch.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} \"The drums were sort of a happy accident. I didn't really think that they would be my ticket out of the ghetto. Choosing to be a musician back then was not like choosing a job, but an entire lifestyle. My father looked at me as if I were going to wear a dress and dance in the circus.\"\n\nLynch was always involved in fights at school so his friends reasoned that the high-strung youth might be able to rip the aggression with drums. His parents made him take lessons before they bought him a kit, and he recalls with a laugh, \"as soon as I got my first set they took up tennis\u2014they just split, and I don't blame them.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== The Heartbreakers ==\nLynch started to work with various Florida bands, among them Styrophoam Soule and Road Turkey, and when he was 15 he met [[Ron Blair]], who was six years older than Lynch. \"I remember he accused me of stealing an amp from him. Hell, I didn't steal it. I was roadieing for him!\" Drums didn't absorb all of Lynch's feistiness as his parents had hoped, although he stayed in school long enough to graduate from [[P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School|P.K. Yonge School]] in 1973.\n\nLynch moved to Los Angeles, and hooked up again with fellow Floridian Ron Blair, during a recording session set up by Benmont Tench in 1976. The session also included Jacksonville native Mike Campbell. Benmont called Tom Petty, also from Gainesville, to ask for some help with some vocals. While they were taking a break Petty looked into the recording studio and thought to himself \"this should be my band\".<ref>From Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down a Dream spoken by Petty</ref> Petty had come out to LA with his band Mudcrutch, which Tench and Campbell were originally a part of, and had a recording contract. But once in LA the producers decided they were not keen on the rest of the band, so it broke up, leaving Petty basically a solo act \u2014 something he was not happy about. But because he had the record deal already, after the break Petty went back into the studio and started his pitch. By the end of the evening, Lynch and the rest walked out as Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.\n\nAfter being with the Heartbreakers, Lynch calmed down. \"Tom told me, 'Look man, you can call anybody anything you want...but you can't lay a hand on anyone in this band.' \"  Even though he was still in the band in 1989, Lynch did not perform on any songs on Petty's solo album ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', even though Campbell, Tench and Epstein did.\n\nFor his part, Lynch felt that he had just begun to play well on the band's fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Hard Promises]]'' and ''[[Long After Dark]]''. \"[I'd] gotten looser, more pliable over the years,\" he commented. \"When I listen to our first couple of albums, I think that I sound stiff.\" As Lynch's ability increased, so did the offers to play with other artists, creating experience that covers a wide variety of musical territory. Lynch contributed to albums by the following artists:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*The Amazing Delores\n*[[The Blasters]]\n*[[Jackson Browne]]\n*[[T-Bone Burnett]]\n*[[The Byrds]]\n*[[Belinda Carlisle]]\n*[[Bob Dylan]]\n*[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]\n*[[Elliot Easton]]\n*[[Eurythmics]]\n*[[Aretha Franklin]]\n*[[Don Henley]]\n*[[Jackopierce]]\n*[[Freedy Johnston]]\n*[[Jim Lauderdale]]\n*[[Eric Martin (singer)|Eric Martin]]\n*[[The Mavericks]]\n*[[John Mellencamp]]\n*[[Roger McGuinn]]\n*Kevin Montgomery\n*[[Scotty Moore]]\n*[[Stevie Nicks]]\n*[[The Nudes]]\n*[[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]]\n*[[Timothy B.

His last gig with the Heartbreakers was on October 2, 1994, at the Bridge School Benefit Concert in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]]. It was immediately following this gig that Lynch left the band due to musical and personal differences with Petty. After his departure, Lynch moved back to Florida, where he partnered with longtime friend [[Don Henley]] to help put together the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' reunion album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]''. He also has toured with the Eagles.\n\nLynch gave away his drum sets and now works as a producer and songwriter in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. He teaches children the drums a few times a week at a high school friend's music store in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].\n\nActs Lynch has produced include [[The Band]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Don Henley]], [[Jackopierce]], [[Joe 90]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Sister Hazel]].\n\nAs a songwriter, he has co-written with or written for numerous acts, including [[Matraca Berg]], [[Meredith Brooks]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[The Jeff Healey Band]], [[James House (singer)|James House]], [[June Pointer]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Tora Tora]], [[Sister Hazel]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[the Mavericks]].\n\n[[Tim McGraw]] recorded \"Back When\", a song Lynch wrote with Stephony Smith and Jeff Stevens, for his album ''Live Like You Were Dying''. The song went to No. 1 in early December 2004.\n\nLynch reunited with his former bandmates in 2002 when they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], playing \"American Girl\" and \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\".\n\nTom Petty had the following to say about Lynch, included in his 2005 book, ''[[Conversations with Tom Petty]]'':\n\n{{quote|Stan was a little younger than us. But he was a very good drummer and he was really conscientious, and he worked really hard. And he sang as well. He sang harmony. He was like our main harmony singer in the days before Howie. He was a powerhouse onstage. He reminded me sort of [like] [[Keith Moon]] in a way. He was so powerful I used to say he had this fifth gear that he could go into and just really make everything explode. He was really good at that, and he knew the songs really well. He and I had incredibly good communication onstage; he could read the movement of my shoulder. He could go anywhere I wanted to go. He never took his eyes off me. Anything I did was accented on the drums. Any movement I made. We had great eye communication where I could turn around and look at him, and he knew just exactly what I wanted to do.}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nLynch was involved in a five-year relationship with actress Louise \"Wish\" Foley whom he met while he and the rest of the band were on set shooting a production for the Tom Petty song \"Don't Come Around Here No More\". Foley played the main blond haired Alice in Wonderland character in the video. She was also in the video 'Make It Better (Forget About Me)'\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* Berkery, Patrick.

Hell, I didn't steal it. I was roadieing for him!\" Drums didn't absorb all of Lynch's feistiness as his parents had hoped, although he stayed in school long enough to graduate from [[P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School|P.K. Yonge School]] in 1973.\n\nLynch moved to Los Angeles, and hooked up again with fellow Floridian Ron Blair, during a recording session set up by Benmont Tench in 1976. The session also included Jacksonville native Mike Campbell. Benmont called Tom Petty, also from Gainesville, to ask for some help with some vocals. While they were taking a break Petty looked into the recording studio and thought to himself \"this should be my band\".<ref>From Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down a Dream spoken by Petty</ref> Petty had come out to LA with his band Mudcrutch, which Tench and Campbell were originally a part of, and had a recording contract. But once in LA the producers decided they were not keen on the rest of the band, so it broke up, leaving Petty basically a solo act \u2014 something he was not happy about. But because he had the record deal already, after the break Petty went back into the studio and started his pitch. By the end of the evening, Lynch and the rest walked out as Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.\n\nAfter being with the Heartbreakers, Lynch calmed down. \"Tom told me, 'Look man, you can call anybody anything you want...but you can't lay a hand on anyone in this band.' \"  Even though he was still in the band in 1989, Lynch did not perform on any songs on Petty's solo album ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', even though Campbell, Tench and Epstein did.\n\nFor his part, Lynch felt that he had just begun to play well on the band's fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Hard Promises]]'' and ''[[Long After Dark]]''. \"[I'd] gotten looser, more pliable over the years,\" he commented. \"When I listen to our first couple of albums, I think that I sound stiff.\" As Lynch's ability increased, so did the offers to play with other artists, creating experience that covers a wide variety of musical territory. Lynch contributed to albums by the following artists:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*The Amazing Delores\n*[[The Blasters]]\n*[[Jackson Browne]]\n*[[T-Bone Burnett]]\n*[[The Byrds]]\n*[[Belinda Carlisle]]\n*[[Bob Dylan]]\n*[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]\n*[[Elliot Easton]]\n*[[Eurythmics]]\n*[[Aretha Franklin]]\n*[[Don Henley]]\n*[[Jackopierce]]\n*[[Freedy Johnston]]\n*[[Jim Lauderdale]]\n*[[Eric Martin (singer)|Eric Martin]]\n*[[The Mavericks]]\n*[[John Mellencamp]]\n*[[Roger McGuinn]]\n*Kevin Montgomery\n*[[Scotty Moore]]\n*[[Stevie Nicks]]\n*[[The Nudes]]\n*[[Rank and File]]\n*[[Timothy B.

His last gig with the Heartbreakers was on October 2, 1994, at the Bridge School Benefit Concert in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]]. It was immediately following this gig that Lynch left the band due to musical and personal differences with Petty. After his departure, Lynch moved back to Florida, where he partnered with longtime friend [[Don Henley]] to help put together the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' reunion album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]''. He also has toured with the Eagles.\n\nLynch gave away his drum sets and now works as a producer and songwriter in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. He teaches children the drums a few times a week at a high school friend's music store in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].\n\nActs Lynch has produced include [[The Band]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Don Henley]], [[Jackopierce]], [[Joe 90]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Sister Hazel]].\n\nAs a songwriter, he has co-written with or written for numerous acts, including [[Matraca Berg]], [[Meredith Brooks]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[The Jeff Healey Band]], [[James House (singer)|James House]], [[June Pointer]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Tora Tora]], [[Sister Hazel]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[the Mavericks]].\n\n[[Tim McGraw]] recorded \"Back When\", a song Lynch wrote with Stephony Smith and Jeff Stevens, for his album ''Live Like You Were Dying''. The song went to No. 1 in early December 2004.\n\nLynch reunited with his former bandmates in 2002 when they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], playing \"American Girl\" and \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\".\n\nTom Petty had the following to say about Lynch, included in his 2005 book, ''[[Conversations with Tom Petty]]'':\n\n{{quote|Stan was a little younger than us. But he was a very good drummer and he was really conscientious, and he worked really hard. And he sang as well. He sang harmony. He was like our main harmony singer in the days before Howie. He was a powerhouse onstage. He reminded me sort of [like] [[Keith Moon]] in a way. He was so powerful I used to say he had this fifth gear that he could go into and just really make everything explode. He was really good at that, and he knew the songs really well. He and I had incredibly good communication onstage; he could read the movement of my shoulder. He could go anywhere I wanted to go. He never took his eyes off me. Anything I did was accented on the drums. Any movement I made. We had great eye communication where I could turn around and look at him, and he knew just exactly what I wanted to do.}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nLynch was involved in a five-year relationship with actress Louise \"Wish\" Foley whom he met while he and the rest of the band were on set shooting a production for the Tom Petty song \"Don't Come Around Here No More\". Foley played the main blond haired Alice in Wonderland character in the video. She was also in the video 'Make It Better (Forget About Me)'\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* Berkery, Patrick.

[[King Crab]], [[Chionoecetes bairdi|bairdi]] and [[Chionoecetes|opilio tanner crab]], pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and [[Anoplopoma fimbria|black cod]] harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska are processed throughout the year. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, has the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove.\n\nSalmon remains a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock fillet block, [[shatterpack]] fillets, mince and [[surimi]]. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staff the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.<ref>{{cite web |title= King Cove |work= PeterPan Seafoods, Inc. |url= http://www.ppsf.com/facilities/index.aspx }}</ref>\n\nThe community is served by [[King Cove Airport]], a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air [http://www.flyeiderair.com/about.html] provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors.  Grant Aviation [https://www.flygrant.com/] also flys to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services.\n\nIt is also served by the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], the state-run ferry service which connects it [[Cold Bay, Alaska|Cold Bay]] in the west and [[Sand Point, Alaska|Sand Point]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Cove Alaska|url=http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/comm/king_cove.shtml|website=Alaska Ferry Community Information|publisher=Alaska Department of Transportation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nA partially completed road between King Cove and [[Cold Bay]] is awaiting approval through the [[USDOI]]. This road would pass through the [[Izembek Wilderness]], causing irreparable damage to the preserve per governmental assessments according to a report generated by The Wilderness Society [https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/Timeline%20-%20History%20of%20the%20Proposed%20Road%20Through%20Izembek%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge.pdf].  The previous negative decision by former [[USDOI]] director [[Sally Jewell]] is being reconsidered to include a land swap.  Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road's main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport. On 22 January 2018, Interior Secretary [[Ryan Zinke]] signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|title=Energy and Environment Zinke signs land-swap deal allowing road through Alaska\u2019s Izembek wilderness|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/22/zinke-to-sign-land-swap-deal-allowing-road-through-alaskas-izembek-wilderness/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n\nThe King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]] and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services.

The population density was 31.3 people per square mile (12.1/km\u00b2). There were 207 housing units at an average density of 8.2 per square&nbsp;mile (3.2/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 15.03% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 1.64% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 46.72% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 26.77% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.13% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 5.93% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.79% from two or more races. 7.45% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 170 households out of which 45.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.5% were married couples living together, 15.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.2% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.90 and the average family size was 3.53.\n\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 21.3% under the age of 18, 11.9% from 18 to 24, 41.0% from 25 to 44, 22.7% from 45 to 64, and 3.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 147.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 166.2 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $45,893, and the median income for a family was $47,188. Males had a median income of $30,714 versus $19,125 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,791. About 3.3% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.7% of those under age 18 and 27.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nKing Cove, {{convert|600|nmi|km|sigfig=1}} SW of Anchorage at the end of the Alaska Peninsula, is home to PeterPan Seafoods' largest processing facility. [[King Crab]], [[Chionoecetes bairdi|bairdi]] and [[Chionoecetes|opilio tanner crab]], pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and [[Anoplopoma fimbria|black cod]] harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska are processed throughout the year. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, has the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove.\n\nSalmon remains a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock fillet block, [[shatterpack]] fillets, mince and [[surimi]]. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staff the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.<ref>{{cite web |title= King Cove |work= PeterPan Seafoods, Inc. |url= http://www.ppsf.com/facilities/index.aspx }}</ref>\n\nThe community is served by [[King Cove Airport]], a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air [http://www.flyeiderair.com/about.html] provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors.  Grant Aviation [https://www.flygrant.com/] also flys to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services.\n\nIt is also served by the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], the state-run ferry service which connects it [[Cold Bay, Alaska|Cold Bay]] in the west and [[Sand Point, Alaska|Sand Point]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Cove Alaska|url=http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/comm/king_cove.shtml|website=Alaska Ferry Community Information|publisher=Alaska Department of Transportation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nA partially completed road between King Cove and [[Cold Bay]] is awaiting approval through the [[USDOI]]. This road would pass through the [[Izembek Wilderness]], causing irreparable damage to the preserve per governmental assessments according to a report generated by The Wilderness Society [https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/Timeline%20-%20History%20of%20the%20Proposed%20Road%20Through%20Izembek%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge.pdf].  The previous negative decision by former [[USDOI]] director [[Sally Jewell]] is being reconsidered to include a land swap.  Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road's main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport. On 22 January 2018, Interior Secretary [[Ryan Zinke]] signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|title=Energy and Environment Zinke signs land-swap deal allowing road through Alaska\u2019s Izembek wilderness|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/22/zinke-to-sign-land-swap-deal-allowing-road-through-alaskas-izembek-wilderness/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n\nThe King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]] and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services.  The clinic is open Monday through Friday during normal business hours, closed for all Alaskan and Federal holidays. After hours emergencies are handled by on-call practitioners.  There is an active local [[emergency medical services]] group who provide ambulance service. Care is also provided through Community Health Aide Practitioners, which are unique to Alaska.\n\n==Education==\n[[Aleutians East Borough School District]] (AEBSD) operates the King Cove School.<ref>\"[http://www.aebsd.org/schools Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220092126/http://www.aebsd.org/schools |date=2017-02-20 }}.\" [[Aleutians East Borough School District]].

Between Third Avenue and [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]], it is named '''St. Mark's Place''', after the nearby [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]] on [[10th Street (Manhattan)|10th Street]] at [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]].\n\nSt. Mark's Place is considered a main cultural street for the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. [[Car|Vehicular]] traffic runs east along both [[one-way street]]s. St. Mark's Place features a wide variety of retailers. Venerable institutions lining St. Mark's Place include [[Gem Spa]] and the St. Mark's Hotel. There are several open front markets that sell sunglasses, clothing and jewelry. In her 400-year history of St. Mark's Place (''[[St. Marks Is Dead]]''), [[Ada Calhoun]] called the street \"like superglue for fragmented identities\" and wrote that \"the street is not for people who have chosen their lives ...

Eighth Street was to run from [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] in the west to [[Third Avenue]] and the [[Bowery]] to the east. The area west of Sixth Avenue was already developed as [[Greenwich Village]]. Mercer, Greene, [[Wooster Street (Manhattan)|Wooster]], [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]], [[Sullivan Street]], and MacDougal Street, as well as Laurens Street (present-day [[LaGuardia Place (Manhattan)|LaGuardia Place]]), extended to Eighth Street until the 1820s, when the construction of [[Washington Square Park]] severed Laurens, Thompson, and Sullivan Streets south of [[4th Street (Manhattan)|4th Street]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nAfter the Commissioners' Plan was laid out, property along the street's [[right of way]] quickly developed. By 1835, the [[New York University]] opened its first building, the Silver Center, along Eighth Street near the Washington Square Park. [[Row house]]s were also built on Eighth Street. The street ran between the [[Jefferson Market]], built in 1832 at the west end, and the Tompkins Market, built in 1836, at the east end. These were factors in the street's commercialization in later years.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nEighth Street was supposed to extend to a market place at [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]], but since that idea never came to fruition. Capitalizing on the high-class status of Bond, [[Bleecker Street|Bleecker]], [[Great Jones Street|Great Jones]], and [[Lafayette Street]]s in [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], developer Thomas E. Davis developed the east end of the street and renamed it \"St. Mark's Place\".<ref name=curbed201409>{{cite web | url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/04/the_strange_history_of_the_east_villages_most_famous_street.php | title=The Strange History of the East Village's Most Famous Street | publisher=Curbed NY | date=September 4, 2014 | accessdate=August 17, 2015 | author=Nevius, James}}</ref> Davis built up St. Mark's Place between Third and Second Avenues between 1831 and 1832. Although the original plan was for [[Federal architecture|Federal]] homes, only three such houses remained in 2014.<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nMeanwhile, Eighth Street became home to a literary scene. At Astor Place and Eighth Street, the [[Astor Opera House]] was built by wealthy men and opened in 1847.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=354XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA515&dq=%22astor%22+%22john+sefton%22+%221847%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oOS_aT0xgIVEzGICh3NGwVp#v=onepage&q=%22astor%22%20%22john%20sefton%22%20%221847%22&f=false|title=Records of the New York Stage: from 1750 to 1860|volume=2|author =Ireland, Joseph Norton|publisher=T.

[[Ann Lynch]] started a famous literary salon at 116 [[Waverly Place]] and relocated to 37 West Eighth Street in 1848.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> Around this time and up until the 1890s, Eighth Street was co-named Clinton Place in memory of politician [[DeWitt Clinton]], whose widow lived along nearby [[University Place (Manhattan)|University Place]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s, Eighth Street housed an educational scene as well. The [[Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]], a then-free institution for art, architecture and engineering education, was opened in 1858. The [[Century Association|Century Club]], an arts and letters association, relocated to 46 East Eighth Street around that time; the Bible House of the [[American Bible Society]], was nearby. In addition, the Brevoort Hotel, as well as a marble mansion built by [[John Taylor Johnston]], were erected at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, German immigrants moved into the area around [[Tompkins Square Park]]. The area around St. Mark's Place was nicknamed [[Little Germany, Manhattan|''Kleindeutschland'']], or \"Little Germany\", because of a huge influx of German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of the homes turned into [[boarding house]]s, as the area had 50,000 residents but not a lot of real estate. [[Tenement]] housing was also built on St. Mark's Place.<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nBy the 1870s, apartments replaced stables and houses along the stretch of Eighth Street west of MacDougal Street. The elevated [[IRT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue]] Lines were also built during that time, with stops along the former at [[Ninth Street (IRT Third Avenue Line)|Ninth Street]] and along the latter at [[Eighth Street (IRT Sixth Avenue Line)|Eighth Street]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/><ref name=curbed201409/>\n\n[[File:Wanamaker Annex.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wanamaker's Department Store|Wanamaker]] Annex]]\n\nAt the southwest corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, the street's first commercial building was built. By the 1890s, buildings on the stretch from Bowery to Fifth Avenue were used for trade.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> In 1904, the [[Wanamaker's Department Store]] opened at the former [[A.T. Stewart]] store along Broadway between 9th and 10th Streets, with an annex built at Eighth Street.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\n===20th century===\nIn the early 1900s, Little Germany was shrinking. At the same time, Jews, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians from Eastern Europe started moving in. At this point, St. Mark's Place was considered a part of the [[Lower East Side]].<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nOn the western stretch of Eighth Street, an art scene was growing. [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]], [[Daniel Chester French]], and other artists moved in the stables at Macdougal Alley at this time. By 1916, a studio complex for artists replaced most of these stables, making the areas around Eighth Street popular for [[bohemianism|bohemian]]s. Whitney, a patron for other American painters, combined four houses on West Eighth Street houses into the [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|Whitney Museum]] in 1931.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nThe 1927 construction of the skyscraper at One Fifth Avenue, as well as the [[Eighth Street Playhouse]] movie theater, helped influence development on the Sixth Avenue end of the street, where construction of the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] had required destruction of many buildings there.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> On an adjoining block, the Women's House of Detention was built in Jefferson Market complex in 1929\u20131932 and existed through the 1970s.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s, after [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] ended, West Eighth Street became an entertainment area. Around that time, the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] movement for [[abstract expressionist]] painters was centered around Eighth Street, with many such painters moving to Eighth Street.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], property along 8th Street was converted to apartment houses. The Rhinelander Estate, one of the major landowners on Eighth Street, erected a building between Washington Square North, Fifth Avenue, West Eighth Street, and the Whitney Museum site. Sailor's Snug Harbor, the other major land owner, demolished the blocks from Fifth Avenue to Broadway on the north side of Eighth and Ninth Streets, including the popular Brevoort Hotel. It replaced these blocks mainly with low-rise apartment buildings and stores, as well as two [[high-rise]]s.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> Around this time, West Eighth Street was also becoming the location of neighborhood commerce.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nAfter the elevated train lines were demolished in the 1940s and 1950s, the real estate industry tried to entice residents to the St. Mark's Place area, describing the neighborhood as \"[[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]\". This area became home to an underground scene, and as it was far from public transportation, it became rundown. A 1965 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article described the East Village by telling readers to \"head east from [[Greenwich Village]], and when it starts to look squalid, around the Bowery and Third Avenue, you know you're there.\"<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nIn the 1960s, Macdougal and West Eighth Streets, as well as St. Mark's Place, became a popular area for [[hippie]]s.<ref name=curbed201409 /> A women's clothing store, a pharmacy, and bookstores were replaced by [[fast food]] restaurants and other shops, directed toward the area's tourism base.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\" /> By 1968, St, Mark's Place became a stopping point for [[tour bus]]es, which formerly skipped the area.<ref name=curbed201409 />\n\nIn 1977, St. Marks Place became the epicenter of all things [[Punk Rock]], when [[Manic Panic (brand)|Manic Panic]] opened its doors on July 7, 1977 (7/7/77).<ref>https://mic.com/articles/188830/how-two-sisters-went-from-founding-the-first-punk-store-in-america-to-creating-manic-panic#.5ygZ7vo5A</ref> The shop quickly attracted musicians from Cyndi Lauper to the Ramones.<ref>https://gvshp.org/blog/2012/07/06/manic-panic-35-years-of-making-our-lives-more-colorful/</ref> \n\nIn 1980, hot dog company [[Nathan's Famous]] moved into the location of a former bookstore on Eighth Street, to the anger of some Greenwich Village residents. However, other establishments, such as the [[B. Dalton]] bookstore, clothing stores, and shoe stores, started to attract tourists to the area.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\" /> By the 1990s, the areas around both Eighth Street and St. Mark's Place were becoming rapidly [[Gentrification|gentrified]], with new buildings and establishments being developed along both streets.<ref name=curbed201409 /> The Village Alliance Business Improvement District was formed in 1993 to care for the area around Eighth Street.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\" />\n\n==Notable buildings and sites==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = 295 East 8th Street entrance.jpg\n| width1    = 162\n| caption1  = The entrance to 295 East 8th Street, with \"Talmud Torah Darchei Noam\" above the door\n| image2    = WTM tony 0058.jpg\n| width2    = 158\n| caption2  = [[Marlton House]] in 2008\n}}\n[[File:Whitney Museum 8-12 West 8th Street.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The original location of the [[Whitney Museum]], three converted townhouses at 8\u201312 West 8th Street]]\n\n===8th Street===\n'''East'''\n*127 [[Avenue B (Manhattan)|Avenue B]], also known as 295 East 8th Street, on [[Tompkins Square Park]], was originally the Tompkins Square Lodging House for Boys and Industrial School.

Eighth Street was to run from [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] in the west to [[Third Avenue]] and the [[Bowery]] to the east. The area west of Sixth Avenue was already developed as [[Greenwich Village]]. Mercer, Greene, [[Wooster Street (Manhattan)|Wooster]], [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]], [[Sullivan Street]], and MacDougal Street, as well as Laurens Street (present-day [[LaGuardia Place (Manhattan)|LaGuardia Place]]), extended to Eighth Street until the 1820s, when the construction of [[Washington Square Park]] severed Laurens, Thompson, and Sullivan Streets south of [[4th Street (Manhattan)|4th Street]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nAfter the Commissioners' Plan was laid out, property along the street's [[right of way]] quickly developed. By 1835, the [[New York University]] opened its first building, the Silver Center, along Eighth Street near the Washington Square Park. [[Row house]]s were also built on Eighth Street. The street ran between the [[Jefferson Market]], built in 1832 at the west end, and the Tompkins Market, built in 1836, at the east end. These were factors in the street's commercialization in later years.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nEighth Street was supposed to extend to a market place at [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]], but since that idea never came to fruition. Capitalizing on the high-class status of Bond, [[Bleecker Street|Bleecker]], [[Great Jones Street|Great Jones]], and [[Lafayette Street]]s in [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], developer Thomas E. Davis developed the east end of the street and renamed it \"St. Mark's Place\".<ref name=curbed201409>{{cite web | url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/04/the_strange_history_of_the_east_villages_most_famous_street.php | title=The Strange History of the East Village's Most Famous Street | publisher=Curbed NY | date=September 4, 2014 | accessdate=August 17, 2015 | author=Nevius, James}}</ref> Davis built up St. Mark's Place between Third and Second Avenues between 1831 and 1832.

At Astor Place and Eighth Street, the [[Astor Opera House]] was built by wealthy men and opened in 1847.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=354XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA515&dq=%22astor%22+%22john+sefton%22+%221847%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oOS_aT0xgIVEzGICh3NGwVp#v=onepage&q=%22astor%22%20%22john%20sefton%22%20%221847%22&f=false|title=Records of the New York Stage: from 1750 to 1860|volume=2|author =Ireland, Joseph Norton|publisher=T.

[[Ann Lynch]] started a famous literary salon at 116 [[Waverly Place]] and relocated to 37 West Eighth Street in 1848.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> Around this time and up until the 1890s, Eighth Street was co-named Clinton Place in memory of politician [[DeWitt Clinton]], whose widow lived along nearby [[University Place (Manhattan)|University Place]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s, Eighth Street housed an educational scene as well. The [[Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]], a then-free institution for art, architecture and engineering education, was opened in 1858. The [[Century Association|Century Club]], an arts and letters association, relocated to 46 East Eighth Street around that time; the Bible House of the [[American Bible Society]], was nearby. In addition, the Brevoort Hotel, as well as a marble mansion built by [[John Taylor Johnston]], were erected at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, German immigrants moved into the area around [[Tompkins Square Park]]. The area around St. Mark's Place was nicknamed [[Little Germany, Manhattan|''Kleindeutschland'']], or \"Little Germany\", because of a huge influx of German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of the homes turned into [[boarding house]]s, as the area had 50,000 residents but not a lot of real estate. [[Tenement]] housing was also built on St. Mark's Place.<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nBy the 1870s, apartments replaced stables and houses along the stretch of Eighth Street west of MacDougal Street. The elevated [[IRT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue]] Lines were also built during that time, with stops along the former at [[Ninth Street (IRT Third Avenue Line)|Ninth Street]] and along the latter at [[Eighth Street (IRT Sixth Avenue Line)|Eighth Street]].<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/><ref name=curbed201409/>\n\n[[File:Wanamaker Annex.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wanamaker's Department Store|Wanamaker]] Annex]]\n\nAt the southwest corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, the street's first commercial building was built.

At the same time, Jews, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians from Eastern Europe started moving in. At this point, St. Mark's Place was considered a part of the [[Lower East Side]].<ref name=curbed201409/>\n\nOn the western stretch of Eighth Street, an art scene was growing. [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]], [[Daniel Chester French]], and other artists moved in the stables at Macdougal Alley at this time. By 1916, a studio complex for artists replaced most of these stables, making the areas around Eighth Street popular for [[bohemianism|bohemian]]s. Whitney, a patron for other American painters, combined four houses on West Eighth Street houses into the [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|Whitney Museum]] in 1931.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nThe 1927 construction of the skyscraper at One Fifth Avenue, as well as the [[Eighth Street Playhouse]] movie theater, helped influence development on the Sixth Avenue end of the street, where construction of the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] had required destruction of many buildings there.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> On an adjoining block, the Women's House of Detention was built in Jefferson Market complex in 1929\u20131932 and existed through the 1970s.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s, after [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] ended, West Eighth Street became an entertainment area.

The Rhinelander Estate, one of the major landowners on Eighth Street, erected a building between Washington Square North, Fifth Avenue, West Eighth Street, and the Whitney Museum site. Sailor's Snug Harbor, the other major land owner, demolished the blocks from Fifth Avenue to Broadway on the north side of Eighth and Ninth Streets, including the popular Brevoort Hotel. It replaced these blocks mainly with low-rise apartment buildings and stores, as well as two [[high-rise]]s.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/> Around this time, West Eighth Street was also becoming the location of neighborhood commerce.<ref name=\"villagealliance1\"/>\n\nAfter the elevated train lines were demolished in the 1940s and 1950s, the real estate industry tried to entice residents to the St. Mark's Place area, describing the neighborhood as \"[[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]\".
