John Murphy (1879\u20131961) was Farm Manager at Huntington Castle, while Julia was a shop assistant in the nearby village of Clonegal. He was educated at the local national school and, later, Carnew Vocational School, before graduating to Warrenstown Agricultural College, [[County Meath]].\n\nThroughout his twenties, Murphy helped form his local branch of [[Macra na Feirme]] and became Secretary of the Regional Executive, during which time he won several medals for public speaking and debating. He also had a very active sporting life competing at minor, junior and senior level inter-county Gaelic football for his native Carlow. He also played cricket and handball\n\n==Career==\nMurphy was appointed National Organiser of Macra na Feirme in 1953 and played a leading role in the formation of the [[Irish Farmers' Association|National Farmers Association]] in 1955. His work brought him into every village and town in Ireland and he found himself being introduced as \u201cthe man who knew more people in the country than anyone else\u201d and \u201cthe voice of rural Ireland\u201d. This fact, together with a distinctive speaking voice, found him in demand as a presenter of Sponsored Radio Programmes, between 1961 and 1979, for a remarkable nine different companies including: Whelehans of Finglas, [[Irish Farmers Journal]], [[ACCBank|ACC]], Nitrogen \u00c9ireann, [[Bank of Ireland]], Associated Livestock Marts, Farming Independent, Hygeia of Galway and Goulding Fertilisers.  \n\nThroughout the 1960s Murphy began to develop wide-ranging radio and television career with RT\u00c9 that would last into the 1980s. Works on radio included Country Call, Meet The People and Around The Country. However, it was through television that Murphy was to become most widely recognised. His break came on the 1960s agricultural series ''Land Mark''. This led to the roles of question-master and question-setter (and later on as adjudicator) on the joint RT\u00c9/BBC production of Cross Country Quiz. Between 1973 and 1988 Murphy compiled a total of 14 quiz books based on the programme - all of them best sellers in the year of their publication.\n\nMurphy formally retired in 1992, but continued to accept invites as a quizmaster all over the country for many years after and continued to compile crosswords for several newspapers, including the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nMurphy married Bridie McEvoy in 1967.

Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.\n\n;Planetary habitability\n{{main|Planetary habitability}}\nEfforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated.

The aim is to detect those organisms that are able to survive space travel conditions and to maintain the proliferating capacity.  The best candidates are extremophiles, since they have adapted to survive in different kind of extreme conditions on earth. During the course of evolution, extremophiles have developed various strategies to survive the different stress conditions of different extreme environments. These stress responses could also allow them to survive in harsh space conditions.\n\nThermophilic species G. thermantarcticus is a good example of a microorganism that could survive space travel. It is a bacterium of the spore-forming genus Bacillus. The formation of spores allows for it to survive extreme environments while still being able to restart cellular growth. It is capable of effectively protecting its DNA, membrane and proteins integrity in different extreme conditions (desiccation, temperatures up to -196&nbsp;\u00b0C, UVC and C-ray radiation...). It is also able to repair the damage produced by space environment.\n\nBy understanding how extremophilic organisms can survive the Earth's extreme environments, we can also understand how microorganisms could have survived space travel and how the panspermia hypothesis could be possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Donato|first=Paola|last2=Romano|first2=Ida|last3=Mastascusa|first3=Vincenza|last4=Poli|first4=Annarita|last5=Orlando|first5=Pierangelo|last6=Pugliese|first6=Mariagabriella|last7=Nicolaus|first7=Barbara|date=March 2018|title=Survival and Adaptation of the Thermophilic Species Geobacillus thermantarcticus in Simulated Spatial Conditions|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=48|issue=1|pages=141\u2013158|doi=10.1007/s11084-017-9540-7|pmid=28593333|issn=0169-6149|bibcode=2018OLEB...48..141D}}</ref>\n\n== Missions ==\nResearch into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life.

Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.\n\n;Planetary habitability\n{{main|Planetary habitability}}\nEfforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated.

The aim is to detect those organisms that are able to survive space travel conditions and to maintain the proliferating capacity.  The best candidates are extremophiles, since they have adapted to survive in different kind of extreme conditions on earth. During the course of evolution, extremophiles have developed various strategies to survive the different stress conditions of different extreme environments. These stress responses could also allow them to survive in harsh space conditions.\n\nThermophilic species G. thermantarcticus is a good example of a microorganism that could survive space travel. It is a bacterium of the spore-forming genus Bacillus. The formation of spores allows for it to survive extreme environments while still being able to restart cellular growth. It is capable of effectively protecting its DNA, membrane and proteins integrity in different extreme conditions (desiccation, temperatures up to -196&nbsp;\u00b0C, UVC and C-ray radiation...). It is also able to repair the damage produced by space environment.\n\nBy understanding how extremophilic organisms can survive the Earth's extreme environments, we can also understand how microorganisms could have survived space travel and how the panspermia hypothesis could be possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Donato|first=Paola|last2=Romano|first2=Ida|last3=Mastascusa|first3=Vincenza|last4=Poli|first4=Annarita|last5=Orlando|first5=Pierangelo|last6=Pugliese|first6=Mariagabriella|last7=Nicolaus|first7=Barbara|date=March 2018|title=Survival and Adaptation of the Thermophilic Species Geobacillus thermantarcticus in Simulated Spatial Conditions|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=48|issue=1|pages=141\u2013158|doi=10.1007/s11084-017-9540-7|pmid=28593333|issn=0169-6149|bibcode=2018OLEB...48..141D}}</ref>\n\n== Missions ==\nResearch into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life.

The script is used for other languages like [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]] and has historically been used to write [[Sanskrit]] within [[Bengal]]. There are a total 50 letters, 11 vowels and 39 consonants.\n\nFrom a [[Writing system#Functional classification of writing systems|classificatory point of view]], the Bengali script is an [[abugida]], i.e. its vowel [[graphemes]] are mainly realised not as independent letters, but as [[diacritic]]s modifying the [[inherent vowel|vowel inherent]] in the base letter they are added to. Bengali script is written from left to right and has no distinct [[letter case]]s. It is recognisable, as are other [[Brahmic scripts]], by a distinctive horizontal line known as {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}}, ''matra'' running along the tops of the letters that links them together. The Bengali script is however less blocky and presents a more sinuous shape.<ref name=georgec>George Cardona and Danesh Jain (2003), The Indo-Aryan Languages, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772945}}</ref> {{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=Less blocky and more sinuous than what? Several Brahmic scripts (e.g. Burmese, Malayalam and Odia) are quite sinuous. Reference addition May 2018: probably quoted from this; see article Devanagari, intro part.}}\n\n==History==\nThe Bengali script evolved from the [[Siddham script]] or kutil lipi, which belongs to the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family]] of scripts. In addition to differences in how the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some typographical differences between the version of the script used for [[Assamese language]] and that used for [[Bengali language]]:\n* ''r\u00f4'' is represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali, and as {{lang|bn|\u09f0}} in Assamese.\n* Assamese script has a character, ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}; in Bengali it was represented as {{lang|bn|\u09ac}}, same as ''b\u00f4'', and was called {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}} ''\u00f4nt\u00f4sth\u00f4 b\u00f4'', to differentiate it from the other b\u00f4 called {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} ''b\u00f4rgiy\u00f4 b\u00f4'' but it lost its distinctive sound over the course of time (and was pronounced just like {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}}) and recently, it was merged with {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} (though difference is still found in form of {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la'', which is the diacritic form of {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}}) especially due to both being represented by the same letter.\n\nThe version of the script used for Manipuri is also a different variation; it uses the ''r\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali script without the different representation as in Assamese script. It also uses the Assamese script character sounding ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}.\n\nThe Bengali script was originally not associated with any particular language but was often used in the eastern regions of the [[Middle kingdoms of India]] and then in the [[Pala Empire]]. It later continued to be specifically used in the [[History of Bengal|Bengal region]]. It was later standardised into the modern Bengali script by [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] under the reign of the [[East India Company]]. Today, the script holds official script status in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], and it is associated with the daily life of [[Bengalis]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe Bengali script can be divided into vowels and vowel diacritics/marks, consonants and consonant conjuncts, diacritical and other symbols, digits, and punctuation marks. Vowels & consonants are used as alphabet and also as diacritical marks. \n\n===Vowels===\nThe Bengali script has a total of 9 vowel [[graphemes]], each of which is called a {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'' \"vowel letter\". The ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4''s represent six of the seven [[Bengali phonology#Consonants and vowels|main vowel sounds]] of Bengali, along with two vowel [[Bengali phonology#Diphthongs|diphthongs]]. All of them are used in both Bengali and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] languages.\n* \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\" ''\u00f4'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0985}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 \u00f4'', \"vocalic \u00f4\") {{IPA|/\u0254/}} sounds as the default [[inherent vowel]] for the entire Bengali script.\n* Even though the [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is one of the seven main vowel sounds in the standard Bengali language, no distinct vowel symbol has been allotted for it in the script since there is no {{IPA|/\u025b/}} sound in Sanskrit, the primary written language when the script was conceived. As a result, the sound is orthographically realised by multiple means in modern Bengali orthography, usually using some combination of \"{{lang|bn|\u098f}}\" ''e'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u098f}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 e'', \"vocalic e\") {{IPA|/e/}}, \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\", \"{{lang|bn|\u0986}}\" ''a'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0986}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 a'') {{IPA|/a/}} and the {{lang|bn|\u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' (diacritic form of the consonant grapheme {{lang|bn|\u09af}} ''j\u00f4'').\n* There are two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} and two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[u]}}. The redundancy stems from the time when this script was used to write [[Sanskrit]], a language that had short and long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u0987}}\" ''i'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0987}} r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 i'', \"short i\") {{IPA|/i/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0988}}\" ''\u012b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u0988 dirgh\u00f4 \u012b'', \"long \u012b\") {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and \"{{lang|bn|\u0989}}\" ''u'' (''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0989 r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 u'') {{IPA|/u/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u098a}}\" ''\u016b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u098a dirgh\u00f4 \u016b'') {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. The letters are preserved in the Bengali script with their traditional names despite the fact that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech. These graphemes serve an etymological function, however, in preserving the original Sanskrit spelling in ''[[Tatsama|t\u00f4ts\u00f4m\u00f4]]'' Bengali words (words borrowed from Sanskrit).\n* The grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\" ''\u1e5b'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098b r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 ri'', \"short ri\", as it used to be) does not really represent a vowel phoneme in Bengali but the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09bf}} {{IPA|/ri/}}. Nevertheless, it is included in the vowel section of the inventory of the Bengali script. This inconsistency is also a remnant from [[Sanskrit]], where the grapheme represents the [[vocalic]] equivalent of a [[retroflex approximant]] (possibly an [[r-colored vowel]]). Another grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098c}}\" ''\u1e37'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098c r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 li'' as it used to be) representing the vocalic equivalent of a [[dental approximant]] in Sanskrit but actually representing the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09bf}} {{IPA|/li/}} in Bengali instead of a vowel phoneme, was also included in the vowel section but unlike \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\", it was recently discarded from the inventory since its usage was extremely limited even in Sanskrit.\n* When a vowel sound occurs syllable-initially or when it follows another vowel, it is written using a distinct letter. When a vowel sound follows a consonant (or a consonant cluster), it is written with a diacritic which, depending on the vowel, can appear above, below, before or after the consonant. These vowel marks cannot appear without a consonant and are called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar''.\n* An exception to the above system is the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, which has no vowel mark but is considered inherent in every consonant letter. To denote the absence of the inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} following a consonant, a diacritic called the {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4}} ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'' (\u09cd) may be written underneath the consonant.\n* Although there are only two diphthongs in the inventory of the script: \"{{lang|bn|\u0990}}\" ''oi'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0990 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 oi'', \"vocalic oi\") {{IPA|/oi/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0994}}\" ''ou'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0994 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 ou'') {{IPA|/ou/}}, the Bengali phonetic system has, in fact, many diphthongs.<ref group=\"nb\">Different Bengali linguists give different numbers of Bengali diphthongs in their works depending on methodology, e.g. 25 (Chatterji 1939: 40), 31 (Hai 1964), 45 (Ashraf and Ashraf 1966: 49), 28 (Kostic and Das 1972:6\u20137) and 17 (Sarkar 1987).</ref> Most diphthongs are represented by juxtaposing the graphemes of their forming vowels, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09c7\u0989}} ''keu'' {{IPA|/keu/}}.\n* There also used to be two long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u09e0}}\" ''\u1e5d'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e0 dirgh\u00f4 rri'', \"long rri\") and \"{{lang|bn|\u09e1}}\" ''\u1e39'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e1 dirgh\u00f4 lli''), which were [[Spelling reform|removed]] from the inventory during the [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar#Bengali alphabet and language reconstruction|Vidyasagarian reform]] of the script due to peculiarity to Sanskrit.\n\nThe table below shows the vowels present in the modern (since the late nineteenth century) inventory of the Bengali alphabet:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|-\n|+ '''Bengali vowels<br/>({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sb\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'')'''\n|-\n!\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac}} ([[Short vowel|short]])\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998}} ([[Long vowel|long]])\n|-\n!\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark)\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark) \n|-\n!''\u0995\u09a8\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />(Guttural)\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u0985\n| {{transl|bn|\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|\u0254}}~{{IPAlink|o}}/<ref name=\"inherent\" group=\"nc\">The natural pronunciation of the grapheme \u0985, whether in its independent (visible) form or in its \"inherent\" (invisible) form in a consonant grapheme, is {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.

Another, now extinct, sibilant was {{IPAslink|\u0282}}, originally represented by \u09b7. \u09b7 is mostly pronounced as /{{IPAlink|\u0255}}~{{IPAlink|\u0283}}/, but in conjunction with apical alveolar consonants, the {{IPAslink|\u0282}} sound can sometimes be found.</ref>\n\n|-\n!''\u09ae\u09c2\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09a8\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Retroflex]])<ref name=\"murdhonno\" group=\"nc\">In modern text often the name {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09ae\u09c2\u09b2\u09c0\u09af\u09bc}} ([[Alveolar consonant|\"alveolar\"]]) or {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09b6\u09cd\u099a\u09be\u09a6\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09c2\u09b2\u09c0\u09af\u09bc}} ([[Postalveolar consonant|\"postalveolar\"]]) is used to describe letters previously described as retroflex more precisely.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u099f||{{transl|bn|\u1e6d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|\u0288}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a0||{{transl|bn|\u1e6dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|\u0288\u02b0}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a1||{{transl|bn|\u1e0d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|\u0256}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a2||{{transl|bn|\u1e0dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|\u0256\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a3||{{transl|bn|\u1e47\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/<ref name=\"murdhonno-na\" group=\"nc\">The original sound for \u09a3 was /{{IPAlink|\u0273}}\u0254/ but in modern Bengali it is almost always pronounced /{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/ same as \u09a8; except for in conjuncts with other retroflex letters, original sound for \u09a3 can occasionally be found.</ref>\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b0||{{transl|bn|r\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|r}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|\u027e}}\u0254/<ref name=\"ra\" group=\"nc\">The Voiced Alveolar Trill [{{IPAlink|r}}] occurs word-initially; as against to Voiced Alveolar Flap [{{IPAlink|\u027e}}], which occurs medially and finally.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b7||{{transl|bn|\u1e63\u00f4}}<br />{{IPAlink|\u0283}}\u0254/<ref name=\"shiss\" group=\"nc\" />\n|-\n!''\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Dental consonant|Dental]])\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a4||{{transl|bn|t\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|t\u032a|t}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a5||{{transl|bn|th\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|t\u02b0}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a6||{{transl|bn|d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|d\u032a|d}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a7||{{transl|bn|dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|d\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a8||{{transl|bn|n\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b2||{{transl|bn|l\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|l}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b8||{{transl|bn|s\u00f4/sh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|s}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|\u0283}}\u0254/<ref name=\"shiss\" group=\"nc\" />\n|-\n!''\u0993\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Labial consonant|Labial]])\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09aa||{{transl|bn|p\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|p}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ab||{{transl|bn|ph\u00f4/f\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|p\u02b0}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|f}}\u0254/<ref name=\"pha\" group=\"nc\">Although \u09ab represents the aspirated form of the [[voiceless bilabial stop]] /{{IPA|p\u02b0}}\u0254/ it is pronounced either [[voiceless labial fricative]] /{{IPA|\u0278}}\u0254/ (in Eastern dialects) or [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] /{{IPA|f}}\u0254/ in ordinary speech.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ac||{{transl|bn|b\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|b}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ad||{{transl|bn|bh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|b\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ae||{{transl|bn|m\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|m}}\u0254/\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px; color:#808080\" bgcolor=\"#EEEFE4\"|\u09ac|| style=\"color:#808080\" bgcolor=\"#EEEFE4\"| {{transl|bn|\u03b2\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|b}}\u0254/\n| colspan=\"2\"|\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Typically, the first consonant in the conjunct is shown above and/or to the left of the following consonants. Many consonants appear in an abbreviated or compressed form when serving as part of a conjunct. Others simply take exceptional forms in conjuncts, bearing little or no resemblance to the base character.\n\nOften, consonant conjuncts are not actually pronounced as would be implied by the pronunciation of the individual components. For example, adding {{lang|bn|\u09b2}} ''l\u00f4'' underneath {{lang|bn|\u09b6}} ''sh\u00f4'' in Bengali creates the conjunct {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09b2}}, which is not pronounced ''shl\u00f4'' but ''sl\u00f4'' in Bengali. Many conjuncts represent Sanskrit sounds that were lost centuries before modern Bengali was ever spoken as in {{lang|bn|\u099c\u09cd\u099e}}. It is a combination of {{lang|bn|\u099c}} \u01f0\u00f4 and {{lang|bn|\u099e}} \u00f1\u00f4 but it is not pronounced \"\u01f0\u00f1\u00f4\" or \"jn\u00f4\". Instead, it is pronounced ''gg\u00f4'' in modern Bengali. Thus, as conjuncts often represent (combinations of) sounds that cannot be easily understood from the components, the following descriptions are concerned only with the construction of the conjunct, and not the resulting pronunciation.\n\n(Some graphemes may appear in a form other than the mentioned form due to the font used)\n\n====Fused forms====\nSome consonants fuse in such a way that one stroke of the first consonant also serves as a stroke of the next.\n* The consonants can be placed on top of one another, sharing their vertical line: {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u0995}} kk\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09a8}} gn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09b2}} gl\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09cd\u09a8}} nn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u09a8}} pn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u09aa}} pp\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2}} ll\u00f4 etc.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, \u09ac b\u00f4 can hang on the vertical line under the preceding consonants, taking the shape of \u09ac b\u00f4 (includes \u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la''): {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09ac}} gb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a3\u09cd\u09ac}} \"\u1e47b\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u09ac}} \"db\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09cd\u09ac}} lb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09ac}} \"shb\u00f4\".\n* The consonants can also be placed side-by-side, sharing their vertical line: {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u09a6}} dd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6}} nd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6}} bd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u099c}} b\u01f0\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u099f}} p\u1e6d\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u099a}} shch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u099b}} shchh\u00f4, etc.\n\n====Approximated forms====\nSome consonants are written closer to one another simply to indicate that they are in a conjunct together.\n* The consonants can be placed side-by-side, appearing unaltered: {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u0997}} dg\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u0998}} dgh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a1\u09cd\u09a1}} \u1e0d\u1e0d\u00f4.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 can appear immediately to the right of the preceding consonant, taking the shape of {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 (includes \u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la''): {{lang|bn|\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac}} \"dhb\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09ac}} bb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09ac}} \"hb\u00f4\".\n\n====Compressed forms====\nSome consonants are compressed (and often simplified) when appearing as the first member of a conjunct.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0999}} ng\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a}} ch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} \u1e0d\u00f4 and {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 are often compressed and placed at the top-left of the following consonant, with little or no change to the basic shape: {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} \"ngk\u1e63\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0996}} ngkh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0998}} nggh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u09ae}} ngm\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099a}} chch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099b}} chchh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099e}} \"chn\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a1\u09cd\u09a2}} \u1e0d\u1e0dh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u200d\u09ac}} bb\u00f4.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} t\u00f4 is compressed and placed above the following consonant, with little or no change to the basic shape: {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09a8}} tn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09ae}} \"tm\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09ac}} \"tb\u00f4\".\n* As the first member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} m\u00f4 is compressed and simplified to a curved shape.

''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'') under the previous member: \u0996\u09cd\u09b0 khr\u00f4 \u0997\u09cd\u09b0 gr\u00f4 \u0998\u09cd\u09b0 ghr\u00f4 \u09ac\u09cd\u09b0 br\u00f4, etc.\n** In some fonts, certain conjuncts with \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using the compressed (and often simplified) form of the previous consonant: \u099c\u09cd\u09b0 \u01f0r\u00f4 \u099f\u09cd\u09b0

\u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using the abbreviated form of the previous consonant: \u0995\u09cd\u09b0 kr\u00f4 \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 tr\u00f4 \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0 bhr\u00f4.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, \u09af j\u00f4 appears as a wavy vertical line (called \u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'') to the right of the previous member: \u0995\u09cd\u09af

''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using special fused forms: \u09a6\u09cd\u09af \"dy\u00f4\" \u09a8\u09cd\u09af \"ny\u00f4\" \u09b6\u09cd\u09af \"shy\u00f4\" \u09b7\u09cd\u09af \"\u1e63y\u00f4\" \u09b8\u09cd\u09af \"sy\u00f4\" \u09b9\u09cd\u09af \"hy\u00f4\".\n\n====Exceptions====\n* When followed by \u09b0 r\u00f4 or \u09a4 t\u00f4, \u0995 k\u00f4 takes on the same form as \u09a4 t\u00f4 would with the addition of a curl to the right: \u0995\u09cd\u09b0 kr\u00f4, \u0995\u09cd\u09a4 kt\u00f4.\n* When preceded by the abbreviated form of \u099e \u00f1\u00f4, \u099a ch\u00f4 takes the shape of \u09ac b\u00f4: \u099e\u09cd\u099a \u00f1ch\u00f4\n* When preceded by another \u099f \u1e6d\u00f4, \u099f is reduced to a leftward curl: \u099f\u09cd\u099f \u1e6d\u1e6d\u00f4.\n* When preceded by \u09b7 \u1e63\u00f4, \u09a3 \u1e47\u00f4 appears as two loops to the right: \u09b7\u09cd\u09a3 \u1e63\u1e47\u00f4.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, or when at the end of a word and followed by no vowel, \u09a4 t\u00f4 can appear as [[\u09ce]]: \u09ce\u09b8 \"ts\u00f4\" \u09ce\u09aa tp\u00f4 \u09ce\u0995 tk\u00f4 etc.\n* When preceded by \u09b9 h\u00f4, \u09a8 n\u00f4 appears as a curl to the right: \u09b9\u09cd\u09a8 \"hn\u00f4\".\n* Certain combinations must be memorised: \u0995\u09cd\u09b7 \"k\u1e63\u00f4\" \u09b9\u09cd\u09ae \"hm\u00f4\".\n\n===Certain compounds===\n\nWhen serving as a vowel mark, \u0989 u, \u098a u, and \u098b ri take on many exceptional forms.\n* \u0989 u\n** When following \u0997 g\u00f4 or \u09b6 sh\u00f4, it takes on a variant form resembling the final tail of \u0993 o: \u0997\u09c1 gu \u09b6\u09c1 shu.\n** When following a \u09a4 t\u00f4 that is already part of a conjunct with \u09aa p\u00f4, \u09a8 n\u00f4 or \u09b8 s\u00f4, it is fused with the \u09a4 to resemble \u0993 o: \u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 ntu \u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 stu \u09aa\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 ptu.\n** When following \u09b0 r\u00f4, and in many fonts also following the variant \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'', it appears as an upward curl to the right of the preceding consonant as opposed to a downward loop below: \u09b0\u09c1 ru \u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 gru \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 tru \u09a5\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 thru \u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 dru \u09a7\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 dhru \u09ac\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 bru \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 bhru \u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 shru.\n** When following \u09b9 h\u00f4, it appears as an extra curl: \u09b9\u09c1 hu.\n* \u098a u\n** When following \u09b0 r\u00f4, and in many fonts also following the variant \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'', it appears as a downstroke to the right of the preceding consonant as opposed to a downward hook below: \u09b0\u09c2 r\u016b \u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 gr\u016b \u09a5\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 thr\u016b \u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 dr\u016b \u09a7\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 dhr\u016b \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 bhr\u016b \u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 shr\u016b.\n* \u098b ri\n** When following \u09b9 h\u00f4, it takes the variant shape of \u098a u: \u09b9\u09c3 hri.\n* Conjuncts of three consonants also exist, and follow the same rules as above: \u09b8 s\u00f4 + \u09a4 t\u00f4 +\u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 str\u00f4, \u09ae m\u00f4 + \u09aa p\u00f4 + \u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09ae\u09cd\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0 mpr\u00f4, \u099c \u01f0\u00f4 + \u099c \u01f0\u00f4 + \u09ac b\u00f4 = \u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09cd\u09ac \"\u01f0\u01f0b\u00f4\", \u0995\u09cd\u09b7 \"k\u1e63\u00f4\" + \u09ae m\u00f4 = \u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cd\u09ae \"k\u1e63m\u00f4\".\n* Theoretically, four-consonant conjuncts can also be created, as in \u09b0 r\u00f4 + \u09b8 s\u00f4 + \u099f \u1e6d\u00f4 + \u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09b0\u09cd\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09cd\u09b0 rs\u1e6dr\u00f4, but they are not found in native words.\n\n===Diacritics and other symbols===\nThese are mainly the Brahmi-Sanskrit diacritics, phones and

Bengali numerals have no horizontal headstroke or \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be \"matra\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n|-\n! Bengali numerals\n| \u09e6\n| \u09e7\n| \u09e8\n| \u09e9\n| \u09ea\n| \u09eb\n| \u09ec\n| \u09ed\n| \u09ee\n| \u09ef\n|}\n\nNumbers larger than 9 are written in Bengali using a positional base 10 numeral system (the decimal system). A period or dot is used to denote the [[decimal separator]], which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|group]] digits, indicating the [[thousand]] (\u09b9\u09be\u099c\u09be\u09b0 ''hazar''), the [[hundred thousand]] or [[lakh]] (\u09b2\u09be\u0996 ''lakh'' or \u09b2\u0995\u09cd\u09b7 ''l\u00f4kkh\u00f4''), and the ten million or hundred lakh or [[crore]] (\u0995\u09cb\u099f\u09bf ''koti'') units. In other words, leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.\n\nFor example, the English number 17,557,345 will be written in traditional Bengali as \u09e7,\u09ed\u09eb,\u09eb\u09ed,\u09e9\u09ea\u09eb.\n\n===Punctuation marks===\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke \u09a6\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf ''dari'' (\u0964), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar: commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, etc. are the same as in English. Capital letters are absent in the Bengali script so proper names are unmarked.\n\nAn apostrophe, known in Bengali as \u098a\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u0995\u09ae\u09be ''urdhb\u00f4k\u00f4ma'' \"upper comma\", is sometimes used to distinguish between [[homograph]]s, as in \u09aa\u09be\u099f\u09be ''pata'' \"plank\" and \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be ''pa'ta'' \"the leg\". Sometimes, a hyphen is used for the same purpose (as in \u09aa\u09be-\u099f\u09be, an alternative of \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be).\n\n===Characteristics of the Bengali text===\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An example of handwritten Bengali script. Part of a poem written by Nobel Laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] in 1926 in Hungary.]]\n\nBengali text is written and read horizontally, from left to right. The consonant graphemes and the full form of vowel graphemes fit into an imaginary rectangle of uniform size (uniform width and height). The size of a consonant conjunct, regardless of its complexity, is deliberately maintained the same as that of a single consonant grapheme, so that diacritic vowel forms can be attached to it without any distortion. In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but that spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.\n\nUnlike in western scripts ([[Latin script|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], etc.) for which the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter \u09a4 ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral \u09e9 \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel \u098f ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n{| class = wikitable style=\"float:right; margin:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Grapheme !!

While efforts at standardising the alphabet for the Bengali language continue in such notable centres as the [[Bangla Academy]] at [[Dhaka]] (Bangladesh) and the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi|P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4 Bangla Akademi]] at [[Kolkata]] ([[West Bengal]], India), it is still not quite uniform, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Assamese and Bengali variations exist today in the formalised system.\n\nIt seems likely that [[standardisation]] of the alphabet will be greatly influenced by the need to typeset it on computers. The large alphabet can be represented, with a great deal of ingenuity, within the [[ASCII]] character set, omitting certain irregular conjuncts. Work has been underway since around 2001 to develop [[Unicode]] [[fonts]], and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern. In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Bengali language, a [[Romanization of Bengali|Romanization]] scheme used by linguists specialising in [[Bengali phonology]] is included along with [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription. A recent effort by the [[Government of West Bengal]] focused on simplifying the Bengali orthography in primary school texts.\n\nThere is still no uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for the problem.\n\n==Romanization==\n{{Main|Romanization of Bengali}}\n\nRomanization of Bengali is the representation of the [[Bengali language]] in the [[Latin script]]. There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali, created in recent years but failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. While different standards for [[romanisation]] have been proposed for Bengali, they have not been adopted with the degree of uniformity seen in languages such as Japanese or Sanskrit.<ref group=\"nb\">In Japanese, there is some debate as to whether to accent certain distinctions, such as T\u014dhoku vs Tohoku. Sanskrit is well-standardized because the speaking community is relatively small, and [[sound change]] is not a large concern.</ref> The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation in which the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or \"IAST system\"<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html | archivedate=12 February 2007 | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case alphabets suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/ | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package | accessdate=20 November 2006 | publisher=Avinash Chopde}}</ref> and the extension of IAST intended for non-Sanskrit languages of the Indian region called the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration | accessdate=20 November 2006 | date=1 April 1999 | format=PDF | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2014 ISCII | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]] | page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Sample texts==\n\n'''Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights'''\n\n<br>'''[[Bengali language|Bengali]] in Bengali alphabet'''<br>\n:'''\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09e7:''' \u09b8\u09ae\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09b7 \u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09c0\u09a8\u09ad\u09be\u09ac\u09c7 \u09b8\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a6\u09be \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u0985\u09a7\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09ae\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09b9\u09a3 \u0995\u09b0\u09c7\u0964 \u09a4\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09bf\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u09ac\u09c1\u09a6\u09cd\u09a7\u09bf \u0986\u099b\u09c7; \u09b8\u09c1\u09a4\u09b0\u09be\u0982 \u09b8\u0995\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0\u0987 \u098f\u0995\u09c7 \u0985\u09aa\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4\u09bf \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09ac\u09b8\u09c1\u09b2\u09ad \u09ae\u09a8\u09cb\u09ad\u09be\u09ac \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u0986\u099a\u09b0\u09a3 \u0995\u09b0\u09be \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09a4\u0964\n'''[[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[Romanization of Bengali|phonetic Romanization]]'''<br>\n:'''Dhara \u00e6k:''' \u0160omosto manush \u0161adhinbhabe \u0161oman morjada \u00e6bong odhikar niye jonmogrohon kore.

The script is used for other languages like [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]] and has historically been used to write [[Sanskrit]] within [[Bengal]]. There are a total 50 letters, 11 vowels and 39 consonants.\n\nFrom a [[Writing system#Functional classification of writing systems|classificatory point of view]], the Bengali script is an [[abugida]], i.e. its vowel [[graphemes]] are mainly realised not as independent letters, but as [[diacritic]]s modifying the [[inherent vowel|vowel inherent]] in the base letter they are added to. Bengali script is written from left to right and has no distinct [[letter case]]s. It is recognisable, as are other [[Brahmic scripts]], by a distinctive horizontal line known as {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}}, ''matra'' running along the tops of the letters that links them together. The Bengali script is however less blocky and presents a more sinuous shape.<ref name=georgec>George Cardona and Danesh Jain (2003), The Indo-Aryan Languages, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772945}}</ref> {{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=Less blocky and more sinuous than what? Several Brahmic scripts (e.g. Burmese, Malayalam and Odia) are quite sinuous. Reference addition May 2018: probably quoted from this; see article Devanagari, intro part.}}\n\n==History==\nThe Bengali script evolved from the [[Siddham script]] or kutil lipi, which belongs to the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family]] of scripts. In addition to differences in how the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some typographical differences between the version of the script used for [[Assamese language]] and that used for [[Bengali language]]:\n* ''r\u00f4'' is represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali, and as {{lang|bn|\u09f0}} in Assamese.\n* Assamese script has a character, ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}; in Bengali it was represented as {{lang|bn|\u09ac}}, same as ''b\u00f4'', and was called {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}} ''\u00f4nt\u00f4sth\u00f4 b\u00f4'', to differentiate it from the other b\u00f4 called {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} ''b\u00f4rgiy\u00f4 b\u00f4'' but it lost its distinctive sound over the course of time (and was pronounced just like {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}}) and recently, it was merged with {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} (though difference is still found in form of {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la'', which is the diacritic form of {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}}) especially due to both being represented by the same letter.\n\nThe version of the script used for Manipuri is also a different variation; it uses the ''r\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali script without the different representation as in Assamese script. It also uses the Assamese script character sounding ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}.\n\nThe Bengali script was originally not associated with any particular language but was often used in the eastern regions of the [[Middle kingdoms of India]] and then in the [[Pala Empire]]. It later continued to be specifically used in the [[History of Bengal|Bengal region]]. It was later standardised into the modern Bengali script by [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] under the reign of the [[East India Company]]. Today, the script holds official script status in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], and it is associated with the daily life of [[Bengalis]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe Bengali script can be divided into vowels and vowel diacritics/marks, consonants and consonant conjuncts, diacritical and other symbols, digits, and punctuation marks. Vowels & consonants are used as alphabet and also as diacritical marks. \n\n===Vowels===\nThe Bengali script has a total of 9 vowel [[graphemes]], each of which is called a {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'' \"vowel letter\". The ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4''s represent six of the seven [[Bengali phonology#Consonants and vowels|main vowel sounds]] of Bengali, along with two vowel [[Bengali phonology#Diphthongs|diphthongs]]. All of them are used in both Bengali and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] languages.\n* \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\" ''\u00f4'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0985}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 \u00f4'', \"vocalic \u00f4\") {{IPA|/\u0254/}} sounds as the default [[inherent vowel]] for the entire Bengali script.\n* Even though the [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is one of the seven main vowel sounds in the standard Bengali language, no distinct vowel symbol has been allotted for it in the script since there is no {{IPA|/\u025b/}} sound in Sanskrit, the primary written language when the script was conceived. As a result, the sound is orthographically realised by multiple means in modern Bengali orthography, usually using some combination of \"{{lang|bn|\u098f}}\" ''e'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u098f}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 e'', \"vocalic e\") {{IPA|/e/}}, \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\", \"{{lang|bn|\u0986}}\" ''a'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0986}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 a'') {{IPA|/a/}} and the {{lang|bn|\u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' (diacritic form of the consonant grapheme {{lang|bn|\u09af}} ''j\u00f4'').\n* There are two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} and two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[u]}}. The redundancy stems from the time when this script was used to write [[Sanskrit]], a language that had short and long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u0987}}\" ''i'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0987}} r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 i'', \"short i\") {{IPA|/i/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0988}}\" ''\u012b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u0988 dirgh\u00f4 \u012b'', \"long \u012b\") {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and \"{{lang|bn|\u0989}}\" ''u'' (''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0989 r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 u'') {{IPA|/u/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u098a}}\" ''\u016b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u098a dirgh\u00f4 \u016b'') {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. The letters are preserved in the Bengali script with their traditional names despite the fact that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech. These graphemes serve an etymological function, however, in preserving the original Sanskrit spelling in ''[[Tatsama|t\u00f4ts\u00f4m\u00f4]]'' Bengali words (words borrowed from Sanskrit).\n* The grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\" ''\u1e5b'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098b r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 ri'', \"short ri\", as it used to be) does not really represent a vowel phoneme in Bengali but the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09bf}} {{IPA|/ri/}}. Nevertheless, it is included in the vowel section of the inventory of the Bengali script. This inconsistency is also a remnant from [[Sanskrit]], where the grapheme represents the [[vocalic]] equivalent of a [[retroflex approximant]] (possibly an [[r-colored vowel]]). Another grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098c}}\" ''\u1e37'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098c r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 li'' as it used to be) representing the vocalic equivalent of a [[dental approximant]] in Sanskrit but actually representing the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09bf}} {{IPA|/li/}} in Bengali instead of a vowel phoneme, was also included in the vowel section but unlike \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\", it was recently discarded from the inventory since its usage was extremely limited even in Sanskrit.\n* When a vowel sound occurs syllable-initially or when it follows another vowel, it is written using a distinct letter. When a vowel sound follows a consonant (or a consonant cluster), it is written with a diacritic which, depending on the vowel, can appear above, below, before or after the consonant. These vowel marks cannot appear without a consonant and are called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar''.\n* An exception to the above system is the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, which has no vowel mark but is considered inherent in every consonant letter. To denote the absence of the inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} following a consonant, a diacritic called the {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4}} ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'' (\u09cd) may be written underneath the consonant.\n* Although there are only two diphthongs in the inventory of the script: \"{{lang|bn|\u0990}}\" ''oi'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0990 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 oi'', \"vocalic oi\") {{IPA|/oi/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0994}}\" ''ou'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0994 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 ou'') {{IPA|/ou/}}, the Bengali phonetic system has, in fact, many diphthongs.<ref group=\"nb\">Different Bengali linguists give different numbers of Bengali diphthongs in their works depending on methodology, e.g. 25 (Chatterji 1939: 40), 31 (Hai 1964), 45 (Ashraf and Ashraf 1966: 49), 28 (Kostic and Das 1972:6\u20137) and 17 (Sarkar 1987).</ref> Most diphthongs are represented by juxtaposing the graphemes of their forming vowels, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09c7\u0989}} ''keu'' {{IPA|/keu/}}.\n* There also used to be two long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u09e0}}\" ''\u1e5d'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e0 dirgh\u00f4 rri'', \"long rri\") and \"{{lang|bn|\u09e1}}\" ''\u1e39'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e1 dirgh\u00f4 lli''), which were [[Spelling reform|removed]] from the inventory during the [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar#Bengali alphabet and language reconstruction|Vidyasagarian reform]] of the script due to peculiarity to Sanskrit.\n\nThe table below shows the vowels present in the modern (since the late nineteenth century) inventory of the Bengali alphabet:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|-\n|+ '''Bengali vowels<br/>({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sb\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'')'''\n|-\n!\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac}} ([[Short vowel|short]])\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998}} ([[Long vowel|long]])\n|-\n!\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark)\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark) \n|-\n!''\u0995\u09a8\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />(Guttural)\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u0985\n| {{transl|bn|\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|\u0254}}~{{IPAlink|o}}/<ref name=\"inherent\" group=\"nc\">The natural pronunciation of the grapheme \u0985, whether in its independent (visible) form or in its \"inherent\" (invisible) form in a consonant grapheme, is {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.

Another, now extinct, sibilant was {{IPAslink|\u0282}}, originally represented by \u09b7. \u09b7 is mostly pronounced as /{{IPAlink|\u0255}}~{{IPAlink|\u0283}}/, but in conjunction with apical alveolar consonants, the {{IPAslink|\u0282}} sound can sometimes be found.</ref>\n\n|-\n!''\u09ae\u09c2\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09a8\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Retroflex]])<ref name=\"murdhonno\" group=\"nc\">In modern text often the name {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09ae\u09c2\u09b2\u09c0\u09af\u09bc}} ([[Alveolar consonant|\"alveolar\"]]) or {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09b6\u09cd\u099a\u09be\u09a6\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09c2\u09b2\u09c0\u09af\u09bc}} ([[Postalveolar consonant|\"postalveolar\"]]) is used to describe letters previously described as retroflex more precisely.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u099f||{{transl|bn|\u1e6d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|\u0288}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a0||{{transl|bn|\u1e6dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|\u0288\u02b0}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a1||{{transl|bn|\u1e0d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|\u0256}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a2||{{transl|bn|\u1e0dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|\u0256\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a3||{{transl|bn|\u1e47\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/<ref name=\"murdhonno-na\" group=\"nc\">The original sound for \u09a3 was /{{IPAlink|\u0273}}\u0254/ but in modern Bengali it is almost always pronounced /{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/ same as \u09a8; except for in conjuncts with other retroflex letters, original sound for \u09a3 can occasionally be found.</ref>\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b0||{{transl|bn|r\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|r}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|\u027e}}\u0254/<ref name=\"ra\" group=\"nc\">The Voiced Alveolar Trill [{{IPAlink|r}}] occurs word-initially; as against to Voiced Alveolar Flap [{{IPAlink|\u027e}}], which occurs medially and finally.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b7||{{transl|bn|\u1e63\u00f4}}<br />{{IPAlink|\u0283}}\u0254/<ref name=\"shiss\" group=\"nc\" />\n|-\n!''\u09a6\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Dental consonant|Dental]])\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a4||{{transl|bn|t\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|t\u032a|t}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a5||{{transl|bn|th\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|t\u02b0}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a6||{{transl|bn|d\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|d\u032a|d}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a7||{{transl|bn|dh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|d\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09a8||{{transl|bn|n\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|n}}\u0254/\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b2||{{transl|bn|l\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|l}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px;\"|\u09b8||{{transl|bn|s\u00f4/sh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|s}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|\u0283}}\u0254/<ref name=\"shiss\" group=\"nc\" />\n|-\n!''\u0993\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />([[Labial consonant|Labial]])\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09aa||{{transl|bn|p\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|p}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ab||{{transl|bn|ph\u00f4/f\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|p\u02b0}}\u0254~{{IPAlink|f}}\u0254/<ref name=\"pha\" group=\"nc\">Although \u09ab represents the aspirated form of the [[voiceless bilabial stop]] /{{IPA|p\u02b0}}\u0254/ it is pronounced either [[voiceless labial fricative]] /{{IPA|\u0278}}\u0254/ (in Eastern dialects) or [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] /{{IPA|f}}\u0254/ in ordinary speech.</ref>\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ac||{{transl|bn|b\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|b}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ad||{{transl|bn|bh\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|b\u02b1}}\u0254/\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u09ae||{{transl|bn|m\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPAlink|m}}\u0254/\n\n| style=\"background:#ccf; font-size:24px; color:#808080\" bgcolor=\"#EEEFE4\"|\u09ac|| style=\"color:#808080\" bgcolor=\"#EEEFE4\"| {{transl|bn|\u03b2\u00f4}}<br>/{{IPA|b}}\u0254/\n| colspan=\"2\"|\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Typically, the first consonant in the conjunct is shown above and/or to the left of the following consonants. Many consonants appear in an abbreviated or compressed form when serving as part of a conjunct. Others simply take exceptional forms in conjuncts, bearing little or no resemblance to the base character.\n\nOften, consonant conjuncts are not actually pronounced as would be implied by the pronunciation of the individual components. For example, adding {{lang|bn|\u09b2}} ''l\u00f4'' underneath {{lang|bn|\u09b6}} ''sh\u00f4'' in Bengali creates the conjunct {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09b2}}, which is not pronounced ''shl\u00f4'' but ''sl\u00f4'' in Bengali. Many conjuncts represent Sanskrit sounds that were lost centuries before modern Bengali was ever spoken as in {{lang|bn|\u099c\u09cd\u099e}}. It is a combination of {{lang|bn|\u099c}} \u01f0\u00f4 and {{lang|bn|\u099e}} \u00f1\u00f4 but it is not pronounced \"\u01f0\u00f1\u00f4\" or \"jn\u00f4\". Instead, it is pronounced ''gg\u00f4'' in modern Bengali. Thus, as conjuncts often represent (combinations of) sounds that cannot be easily understood from the components, the following descriptions are concerned only with the construction of the conjunct, and not the resulting pronunciation.\n\n(Some graphemes may appear in a form other than the mentioned form due to the font used)\n\n====Fused forms====\nSome consonants fuse in such a way that one stroke of the first consonant also serves as a stroke of the next.\n* The consonants can be placed on top of one another, sharing their vertical line: {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u0995}} kk\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09a8}} gn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09b2}} gl\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09cd\u09a8}} nn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u09a8}} pn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u09aa}} pp\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2}} ll\u00f4 etc.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, \u09ac b\u00f4 can hang on the vertical line under the preceding consonants, taking the shape of \u09ac b\u00f4 (includes \u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la''): {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09ac}} gb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a3\u09cd\u09ac}} \"\u1e47b\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u09ac}} \"db\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09cd\u09ac}} lb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09ac}} \"shb\u00f4\".\n* The consonants can also be placed side-by-side, sharing their vertical line: {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u09a6}} dd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6}} nd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6}} bd\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u099c}} b\u01f0\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09aa\u09cd\u099f}} p\u1e6d\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u099a}} shch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u099b}} shchh\u00f4, etc.\n\n====Approximated forms====\nSome consonants are written closer to one another simply to indicate that they are in a conjunct together.\n* The consonants can be placed side-by-side, appearing unaltered: {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u0997}} dg\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09cd\u0998}} dgh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a1\u09cd\u09a1}} \u1e0d\u1e0d\u00f4.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 can appear immediately to the right of the preceding consonant, taking the shape of {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 (includes \u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la''): {{lang|bn|\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac}} \"dhb\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09ac}} bb\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09ac}} \"hb\u00f4\".\n\n====Compressed forms====\nSome consonants are compressed (and often simplified) when appearing as the first member of a conjunct.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0999}} ng\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a}} ch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} \u1e0d\u00f4 and {{lang|bn|\u09ac}} b\u00f4 are often compressed and placed at the top-left of the following consonant, with little or no change to the basic shape: {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} \"ngk\u1e63\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0996}} ngkh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u0998}} nggh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u0999\u09cd\u09ae}} ngm\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099a}} chch\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099b}} chchh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09cd\u099e}} \"chn\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a1\u09cd\u09a2}} \u1e0d\u1e0dh\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u200d\u09ac}} bb\u00f4.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} t\u00f4 is compressed and placed above the following consonant, with little or no change to the basic shape: {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09a8}} tn\u00f4 {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09ae}} \"tm\u00f4\" {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09ac}} \"tb\u00f4\".\n* As the first member of a conjunct, {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} m\u00f4 is compressed and simplified to a curved shape.

''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'') under the previous member: \u0996\u09cd\u09b0 khr\u00f4 \u0997\u09cd\u09b0 gr\u00f4 \u0998\u09cd\u09b0 ghr\u00f4 \u09ac\u09cd\u09b0 br\u00f4, etc.\n** In some fonts, certain conjuncts with \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using the compressed (and often simplified) form of the previous consonant: \u099c\u09cd\u09b0 \u01f0r\u00f4 \u099f\u09cd\u09b0

\u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using the abbreviated form of the previous consonant: \u0995\u09cd\u09b0 kr\u00f4 \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 tr\u00f4 \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0 bhr\u00f4.\n* As the last member of a conjunct, \u09af j\u00f4 appears as a wavy vertical line (called \u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'') to the right of the previous member: \u0995\u09cd\u09af

''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' appear using special fused forms: \u09a6\u09cd\u09af \"dy\u00f4\" \u09a8\u09cd\u09af \"ny\u00f4\" \u09b6\u09cd\u09af \"shy\u00f4\" \u09b7\u09cd\u09af \"\u1e63y\u00f4\" \u09b8\u09cd\u09af \"sy\u00f4\" \u09b9\u09cd\u09af \"hy\u00f4\".\n\n====Exceptions====\n* When followed by \u09b0 r\u00f4 or \u09a4 t\u00f4, \u0995 k\u00f4 takes on the same form as \u09a4 t\u00f4 would with the addition of a curl to the right: \u0995\u09cd\u09b0 kr\u00f4, \u0995\u09cd\u09a4 kt\u00f4.\n* When preceded by the abbreviated form of \u099e \u00f1\u00f4, \u099a ch\u00f4 takes the shape of \u09ac b\u00f4: \u099e\u09cd\u099a \u00f1ch\u00f4\n* When preceded by another \u099f \u1e6d\u00f4, \u099f is reduced to a leftward curl: \u099f\u09cd\u099f \u1e6d\u1e6d\u00f4.\n* When preceded by \u09b7 \u1e63\u00f4, \u09a3 \u1e47\u00f4 appears as two loops to the right: \u09b7\u09cd\u09a3 \u1e63\u1e47\u00f4.\n* As the first member of a conjunct, or when at the end of a word and followed by no vowel, \u09a4 t\u00f4 can appear as [[\u09ce]]: \u09ce\u09b8 \"ts\u00f4\" \u09ce\u09aa tp\u00f4 \u09ce\u0995 tk\u00f4 etc.\n* When preceded by \u09b9 h\u00f4, \u09a8 n\u00f4 appears as a curl to the right: \u09b9\u09cd\u09a8 \"hn\u00f4\".\n* Certain combinations must be memorised: \u0995\u09cd\u09b7 \"k\u1e63\u00f4\" \u09b9\u09cd\u09ae \"hm\u00f4\".\n\n===Certain compounds===\n\nWhen serving as a vowel mark, \u0989 u, \u098a u, and \u098b ri take on many exceptional forms.\n* \u0989 u\n** When following \u0997 g\u00f4 or \u09b6 sh\u00f4, it takes on a variant form resembling the final tail of \u0993 o: \u0997\u09c1 gu \u09b6\u09c1 shu.\n** When following a \u09a4 t\u00f4 that is already part of a conjunct with \u09aa p\u00f4, \u09a8 n\u00f4 or \u09b8 s\u00f4, it is fused with the \u09a4 to resemble \u0993 o: \u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 ntu \u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 stu \u09aa\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 ptu.\n** When following \u09b0 r\u00f4, and in many fonts also following the variant \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'', it appears as an upward curl to the right of the preceding consonant as opposed to a downward loop below: \u09b0\u09c1 ru \u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 gru \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 tru \u09a5\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 thru \u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 dru \u09a7\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 dhru \u09ac\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 bru \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 bhru \u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c1 shru.\n** When following \u09b9 h\u00f4, it appears as an extra curl: \u09b9\u09c1 hu.\n* \u098a u\n** When following \u09b0 r\u00f4, and in many fonts also following the variant \u09b0\u09ab\u09b2\u09be ''r\u00f4f\u00f4la'', it appears as a downstroke to the right of the preceding consonant as opposed to a downward hook below: \u09b0\u09c2 r\u016b \u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 gr\u016b \u09a5\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 thr\u016b \u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 dr\u016b \u09a7\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 dhr\u016b \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 bhr\u016b \u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c2 shr\u016b.\n* \u098b ri\n** When following \u09b9 h\u00f4, it takes the variant shape of \u098a u: \u09b9\u09c3 hri.\n* Conjuncts of three consonants also exist, and follow the same rules as above: \u09b8 s\u00f4 + \u09a4 t\u00f4 +\u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 str\u00f4, \u09ae m\u00f4 + \u09aa p\u00f4 + \u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09ae\u09cd\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0 mpr\u00f4, \u099c \u01f0\u00f4 + \u099c \u01f0\u00f4 + \u09ac b\u00f4 = \u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09cd\u09ac \"\u01f0\u01f0b\u00f4\", \u0995\u09cd\u09b7 \"k\u1e63\u00f4\" + \u09ae m\u00f4 = \u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cd\u09ae \"k\u1e63m\u00f4\".\n* Theoretically, four-consonant conjuncts can also be created, as in \u09b0 r\u00f4 + \u09b8 s\u00f4 + \u099f \u1e6d\u00f4 + \u09b0 r\u00f4 = \u09b0\u09cd\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09cd\u09b0 rs\u1e6dr\u00f4, but they are not found in native words.\n\n===Diacritics and other symbols===\nThese are mainly the Brahmi-Sanskrit diacritics, phones and

Bengali numerals have no horizontal headstroke or \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be \"matra\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n|-\n! Bengali numerals\n| \u09e6\n| \u09e7\n| \u09e8\n| \u09e9\n| \u09ea\n| \u09eb\n| \u09ec\n| \u09ed\n| \u09ee\n| \u09ef\n|}\n\nNumbers larger than 9 are written in Bengali using a positional base 10 numeral system (the decimal system). A period or dot is used to denote the [[decimal separator]], which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|group]] digits, indicating the [[thousand]] (\u09b9\u09be\u099c\u09be\u09b0 ''hazar''), the [[hundred thousand]] or [[lakh]] (\u09b2\u09be\u0996 ''lakh'' or \u09b2\u0995\u09cd\u09b7 ''l\u00f4kkh\u00f4''), and the ten million or hundred lakh or [[crore]] (\u0995\u09cb\u099f\u09bf ''koti'') units. In other words, leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.\n\nFor example, the English number 17,557,345 will be written in traditional Bengali as \u09e7,\u09ed\u09eb,\u09eb\u09ed,\u09e9\u09ea\u09eb.\n\n===Punctuation marks===\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke \u09a6\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf ''dari'' (\u0964), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar: Commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, etc. are the same as in English. Capital letters are absent in the Bengali script so proper names are unmarked.\n\nAn apostrophe, known in Bengali as \u098a\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u0995\u09ae\u09be ''urdhb\u00f4k\u00f4ma'' \"upper comma\", is sometimes used to distinguish between [[homograph]]s, as in \u09aa\u09be\u099f\u09be ''pata'' \"plank\" and \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be ''pa'ta'' \"the leg\". Sometimes, a hyphen is used for the same purpose (as in \u09aa\u09be-\u099f\u09be, an alternative of \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be).\n\n===Characteristics of the Bengali text===\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An example of handwritten Bengali script. Part of a poem written by Nobel Laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] in 1926 in Hungary.]]\n\nBengali text is written and read horizontally, from left to right. The consonant graphemes and the full form of vowel graphemes fit into an imaginary rectangle of uniform size (uniform width and height). The size of a consonant conjunct, regardless of its complexity, is deliberately maintained the same as that of a single consonant grapheme, so that diacritic vowel forms can be attached to it without any distortion. In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but that spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.\n\nUnlike in western scripts ([[Latin script|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], etc.) for which the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter \u09a4 ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral \u09e9 \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel \u098f ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n{| class = wikitable style=\"float:right; margin:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Grapheme !!

While efforts at standardising the alphabet for the Bengali language continue in such notable centres as the [[Bangla Academy]] at [[Dhaka]] (Bangladesh) and the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi|P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4 Bangla Akademi]] at [[Kolkata]] ([[West Bengal]], India), it is still not quite uniform, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Assamese and Bengali variations exist today in the formalised system.\n\nIt seems likely that [[standardisation]] of the alphabet will be greatly influenced by the need to typeset it on computers. The large alphabet can be represented, with a great deal of ingenuity, within the [[ASCII]] character set, omitting certain irregular conjuncts. Work has been underway since around 2001 to develop [[Unicode]] [[fonts]], and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern. In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Bengali language, a [[Romanization of Bengali|Romanization]] scheme used by linguists specialising in [[Bengali phonology]] is included along with [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription. A recent effort by the [[Government of West Bengal]] focused on simplifying the Bengali orthography in primary school texts.\n\nThere is still no uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for the problem.\n\n==Romanization==\n{{Main|Romanization of Bengali}}\n\nRomanization of Bengali is the representation of the [[Bengali language]] in the [[Latin script]]. There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali, created in recent years but failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. While different standards for [[romanisation]] have been proposed for Bengali, they have not been adopted with the degree of uniformity seen in languages such as Japanese or Sanskrit.<ref group=\"nb\">In Japanese, there is some debate as to whether to accent certain distinctions, such as T\u014dhoku vs Tohoku. Sanskrit is well-standardized because the speaking community is relatively small, and [[sound change]] is not a large concern.</ref> The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation in which the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or \"IAST system\"<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html | archivedate=12 February 2007 | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case alphabets suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/ | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package | accessdate=20 November 2006 | publisher=Avinash Chopde}}</ref> and the extension of IAST intended for non-Sanskrit languages of the Indian region called the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration | accessdate=20 November 2006 | date=1 April 1999 | format=PDF | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2014 ISCII | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]] | page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Sample texts==\n\n'''Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights'''\n\n<br>'''[[Bengali language|Bengali]] in Bengali alphabet'''<br>\n:'''\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09e7:''' \u09b8\u09ae\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09b7 \u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09c0\u09a8\u09ad\u09be\u09ac\u09c7 \u09b8\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a6\u09be \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u0985\u09a7\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09ae\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09b9\u09a3 \u0995\u09b0\u09c7\u0964 \u09a4\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09bf\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u09ac\u09c1\u09a6\u09cd\u09a7\u09bf \u0986\u099b\u09c7; \u09b8\u09c1\u09a4\u09b0\u09be\u0982 \u09b8\u0995\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0\u0987 \u098f\u0995\u09c7 \u0985\u09aa\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4\u09bf \u09ad\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09ac\u09b8\u09c1\u09b2\u09ad \u09ae\u09a8\u09cb\u09ad\u09be\u09ac \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u0986\u099a\u09b0\u09a3 \u0995\u09b0\u09be \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09a4\u0964\n'''[[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[Romanization of Bengali|phonetic Romanization]]'''<br>\n:'''Dhara \u00e6k:''' \u0160omosto manush \u0161adhinbhabe \u0161oman morjada \u00e6bong odhikar niye jonmogrohon kore.
