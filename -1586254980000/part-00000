Later the town became an importer of Irish wool, but its harbour silted up, and it developed other industries, such as shipbuilding, foundries and sawmills. Its Victorian market survives, with its high glass and timber roof on iron columns. Barnstaple railway station is the terminus of a branch line from Exeter, known as the [[Tarka Line]].\n\nThe parish of Barnstaple had a population of 24,033 at the 2011 census <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/southwestengland/admin/north_devon/E04003069__barnstaple/|title=Barnstaple (Parish, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location|website=www.citypopulation.de|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>.

Barnstaple has a similar ethnic make-up compared with other south west towns, like [[Truro]] and [[Cullompton]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n[[North Devon]] is some distance from the UK's traditional areas of industrial activity and population. In the late 1970s Barnstaple gained a number of industrial companies due to the availability of central government grants for the construction of factories and their operation on low or zero levels of local taxation. This was only partially successful, with few of these lasting more than the few years that grants were available. One success was the manufacturing of generic medicines by Cox Pharmaceuticals (now branded [[Allergan]]), who moved in 1980 from their site in [[Brighton]], Sussex. The most lasting consequence for the town was the development and expansion of the industrial estates at Seven Brethren, Whiddon Valley and Pottington.\n\nWhilst the 1989 opening of the improved [[A361 road|A361]] connection to the motorway network helped in some ways to promote trade, notably weekend tourism, it had a detrimental effect on a number of distribution businesses. The latter had previously viewed the town as a base for local distribution networks, a need that was removed with an approximate halving of travelling time to the [[M5 motorway]].\n\nBecause Barnstaple is the main shopping area for North Devon, retail work is a contributor to the economy. There are many generic [[chain stores]] in the town centre and in the Roundswell Business Park, on the western fringe of the town. [[Tesco]] has several stores in the area, which includes a [[Tesco Extra]] hypermarket, a large Tesco [[superstore]]. There is also a [[Sainsbury's]] superstore, a [[Lidl]] supermarket. And, the multi-million pound redevelopment of the former [[Leaderflush Shapland]] works at Anchorwood Bank, and the surrounding area, is creating a conservation area near the River Taw, hundreds of new homes, a commercial retail area with new shops, restaurants and leisure facilities. A new [[Asda]] superstore and petrol filling station is part of the redevelopment. The whole scheme will be completed by the end of 2017, and the new Asda store opened in November 2016. However, by far the largest employer in the region is local and central Government. The two main government employers in the area are the [[Royal Marines Base Chivenor]], {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} west of the town, and [[North Devon District Hospital]], {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} to the north.\n\nIn 2005 unemployment in North Devon was 1.8\u20132.4%, and the median per capita wage for North Devon was 73% of the UK national average. The level of work in the informal or casual sector is high, partly due to the impact of seasonal tourism, as is the case in much of the South West of England.\n\nIn 2018 unemployment in North Devon has come down significantly since its 2010 high to 1.2%, median weekly full time pay stands at \u00a3440 per week, average house prices stand at \u00a3230,000 and the number of businesses registered has increased by 370 from 2010 to 4895. 2018 has also seen significant Government investment in the area through Coastal Community grants, Housing Infrastructure funds as well at \u00a383 million to upgrade the North Devon Link Road.<ref>House of Commons Library</ref>\n\n==Twin towns and sister cities==\n\nBarnstaple is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]], United States\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Uelzen]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Trouville-sur-Mer]], France<ref name=\"Archant twinning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |title=British towns twinned with French towns |accessdate=2013-07-11 |work=Archant Community Media Ltd |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705094933/http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Susa, Piedmont]], Italy\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Queen Anne's Walk, Barnstaple - geograph.org.uk - 275649.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen Anne's Walk]], formerly the Mercantile Exchange, c. 1708, with the town's main quay to the left.

The station became \"Barnstaple Junction\" on 20 July 1874 when the railway opened the [[Ilfracombe Branch Line|branch line]] through to {{stnlnk|Ilfracombe}}, reverting to just plain \"Barnstaple\" again when this was closed on 5 October 1970.

Barnstaple has a similar ethnic make-up compared with other south west towns, like [[Truro]] and [[Cullompton]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n[[North Devon]] is some distance from the UK's traditional areas of industrial activity and population. In the late 1970s Barnstaple gained a number of industrial companies due to the availability of central government grants for the construction of factories and their operation on low or zero levels of local taxation. This was only partially successful, with few of these lasting more than the few years that grants were available. One success was the manufacturing of generic medicines by Cox Pharmaceuticals (now branded [[Allergan]]), who moved in 1980 from their site in [[Brighton]], Sussex. The most lasting consequence for the town was the development and expansion of the industrial estates at Seven Brethren, Whiddon Valley and Pottington.\n\nWhilst the 1989 opening of the improved [[A361 road|A361]] connection to the motorway network helped in some ways to promote trade, notably weekend tourism, it had a detrimental effect on a number of distribution businesses. The latter had previously viewed the town as a base for local distribution networks, a need that was removed with an approximate halving of travelling time to the [[M5 motorway]].\n\nBecause Barnstaple is the main shopping area for North Devon, retail work is a contributor to the economy. There are many generic [[chain stores]] in the town centre and in the Roundswell Business Park, on the western fringe of the town. [[Tesco]] has several stores in the area, which includes a [[Tesco Extra]] hypermarket, a large Tesco [[superstore]]. There is also a [[Sainsbury's]] superstore, a [[Lidl]] supermarket. And, the multi-million pound redevelopment of the former [[Leaderflush Shapland]] works at Anchorwood Bank, and the surrounding area, is creating a conservation area near the River Taw, hundreds of new homes, a commercial retail area with new shops, restaurants and leisure facilities. A new [[Asda]] superstore and petrol filling station is part of the redevelopment. The whole scheme will be completed by the end of 2017, and the new Asda store opened in November 2016. However, by far the largest employer in the region is local and central Government. The two main government employers in the area are the [[Royal Marines Base Chivenor]], {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} west of the town, and [[North Devon District Hospital]], {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} to the north.\n\nIn 2005 unemployment in North Devon was 1.8\u20132.4%, and the median per capita wage for North Devon was 73% of the UK national average. The level of work in the informal or casual sector is high, partly due to the impact of seasonal tourism, as is the case in much of the South West of England.\n\nIn 2018 unemployment in North Devon has come down significantly since its 2010 high to 1.2%, median weekly full time pay stands at \u00a3440 per week, average house prices stand at \u00a3230,000 and the number of businesses registered has increased by 370 from 2010 to 4895. 2018 has also seen significant Government investment in the area through Coastal Community grants, Housing Infrastructure funds as well at \u00a383 million to upgrade the North Devon Link Road.<ref>House of Commons Library</ref>\n\n==Twin towns and sister cities==\n\nBarnstaple is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]], United States\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Uelzen]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Trouville-sur-Mer]], France<ref name=\"Archant twinning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |title=British towns twinned with French towns |accessdate=2013-07-11 |work=Archant Community Media Ltd |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705094933/http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Susa, Piedmont]], Italy\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Queen Anne's Walk, Barnstaple - geograph.org.uk - 275649.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen Anne's Walk]], formerly the Mercantile Exchange, c. 1708, with the town's main quay to the left.

The station is near the end of the Long Bridge but on the opposite bank of the River Taw to the town centre. The town used to have several other stations but these have all closed since the publication of the ''[[Beeching Axe|Reshaping of British Railways]]'' (the so-called Beeching Axe) report in the 1960s. The surviving station was opened on 1 August 1854 by the [[North Devon Railway]] (later the [[London and South Western Railway]]), although a service had operated from [[Fremington, Devon|Fremington]] since 1848 for goods traffic only. The station became \"Barnstaple Junction\" on 20 July 1874 when the railway opened the [[Ilfracombe Branch Line|branch line]] through to {{stnlnk|Ilfracombe}}, reverting to just plain \"Barnstaple\" again when this was closed on 5 October 1970. It is now a terminus and much reduced in size as part of the site is now used for the [[Barnstaple Western Bypass]].\n\n[[File:Barstaplequay.jpg|thumb|right|Ilfracombe Branchline in the late 1960s.]]\nThe Ilfracombe branch line brought the railway across the river into the town centre. {{stnlnk|Barnstaple Quay}} was situated close by the Castle Mound. It was closed in 1898 and replaced by a nearby {{stnlnk|Barnstaple Town}} station at North Walk which was also the terminus of the [[narrow gauge]] [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]] until this closed in 1935. The narrow gauge line's main depot and operating centre was at nearby {{stnlnk|Pilton}}.\n\nA separate \"Barnstaple\" station, renamed [[Barnstaple Victoria Road railway station|Barnstaple (Victoria Road)]] in 1949, was opened to the east of the town in 1873 as the terminus of the [[Devon and Somerset Railway]], eventually a part of the [[Great Western Railway]]. A junction was later provided to allow trains access to Barnstaple Junction and these ran through to Ilfracombe. It was closed in 1970.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Museum of Barnstaple.JPG|thumb|[[Museum of Barnstaple and North Devon]]]]\nThere are a selection of well-regarded primary and secondary [[state schools]] and a [[Tertiary education|tertiary college]] in Barnstaple.\n\nIn 2012, the county of [[Devon]] 58%<ref name=\"The Guardian | Education\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/24/secondary-school-league-tables-2012-data |work=The Guardian | title=Secondary School League Tables | accessdate=7 March 2013 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rogers | date=24 January 2013}}</ref> of students achieved 5 [[GCSE]]s grade A* to C.\nThe UK average is 59%.<ref name=\"The Guardian | Education\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Percentage of students achieving 5 GCSEs grade A* to C\n!School Name!!Type!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012\n|-\n|[[The Park Community School]]||State||38%||44%||45%||47%||54%||<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/schools/performance/school.pl?urn=136867 |title=Education &#124; League Tables &#124; Park School |publisher=DFE |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Pilton Community College]]||State||47%||51%||50%||53%||49%||<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/schools/performance/school.pl?urn=136867 |work=DFE | title=Pilton Community College | date=27 February 2013 | accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n|}\n[[Petroc College|Petroc]] (formerly [[North Devon College]]) is a large tertiary college providing a wide range of [[vocational]] and academic further education for more than 3,000 young people over 16.

2014}}\nThe Toyokawa Railway opened the section from Toyohashi to Toyokawa in 1897, extending the line to Omi in 1900. At the northern end, the Ina Electric Railway opened the Tatsuno to Ina-Matsushima section (electrified at 1,200 V DC) in 1909, extending the line to Tenryukyo in sections between 1911 and 1927. The Horaitera Railway opened the Omi to Mikawa-Kawai section in 1923, and electrified it at 1,500 V DC in 1925 in conjunction with the electrification of the Toyohashi to Omi section the same year. The Toyohashi to Toyokawa section was double-tracked the following year. The Sanshin Railway opened the Tenryukyo to Kadoshima section as an electrified (1,500 V DC) line in 1932, the Mikawa-Kawai to Toei section (and all subsequent stages) as an electrified line in 1933, and connected the two sections (completing the line) in 1936. All four companies were nationalised in 1943.\n\nIn 1955, the overhead line voltage of the Tatsuno to Tenryukyo section was increased to 1,500 V DC.\n\nCTC signalling was commissioned on the line between 1983 and 1984, and freight services ceased in 1996.\n\n===Former connecting lines===\n* Hon-Nagashino Station: A 23&nbsp;km line to Mikawa-Taguchi, electrified at 1,500 V DC, opened between 1930 and 1932. Two 762mm gauge forest railways connected to this line: the Damine forest railway, which connected at the station of the same name, consisted of a 19&nbsp;km 'main line' (including a tunnel) and a 7&nbsp;km branch, operated between 1932 and 1960; the Taguchi forest railway connected at the terminus station, consisted of a 10&nbsp;km 'main line' and a 6&nbsp;km branch, operated between 1934 and 1963. Both forest railways were notable for initially employing people and \"large dogs\" to haul the empty wagons upgrade, which then rolled downhill when loaded. The Mikawa-Taguchi line closed following flood damage in 1968.\n\n===Proposed connecting line===\n* Chubu-Tenryu Station: Construction started on a 35&nbsp;km line to Tenryu-Futamata on the [[Tenryu Hamanako Railroad Tenryu Hamanako Line|Hamanako Line]] in 1967. Proposed to involve 20 bridges and 14 tunnels, about 13&nbsp;km of roadbed, and about 50% of the overall work had been completed when construction was abandoned in 1980.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of railway lines in Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Iida Line}}\n* [http://jr-central.co.jp/ JR Central official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070821011100/http://jr-central.co.jp/eng.nsf/ JR Central official website]\n\n{{Nagoya transit}}\n{{Nagano transit}}\n{{Central Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n[[Category:Iida Line]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1897]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox rail line\n | box_width   = \n | name        = Iida Line\n | color       = 6197C9\n | logo        = [[File:JR Central Iida Line.svg|50px]]\n | logo_width  =\n | image       = JR-central-119-5300.JPG\n | caption     = JR Central 119 Series train at Inakita Station\n | image_width = 300px\n | system      =\n | type        = [[Heavy rail]]\n | status      =\n | locale      = [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]] prefectures\n | start       = {{STN|Toyohashi}}\n | end         = {{STN|Tatsuno|Nagano}} (through to {{STN|Okaya}})\n | stations    = 94\n | routes      =\n | daily_ridership   = \n | open        = 1897\n | close       =\n | owner       = [[JR Central]]\n | operator    = \n | character   = \n | depot       = \n | stock       = \n | linelength  = {{convert|195.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n | tracklength = \n | tracks      =\n | gauge       = {{track gauge|1067mm|lk=on}}\n | electrification = 1,500 V DC overhead catenary\n | speed       = {{convert|85|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (maximum); 40-50 km/h (curves); 25-35 km/h (diverging junctions)\n | elevation   =\n | map         = [[Image:Routemap JRiidaline.svg|200px]]\n | map_state   = collapsed\n}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Iida Line'''|\u98ef\u7530\u7dda|Iida-sen|}} is a Japanese railway line connecting [[Toyohashi Station]] in [[Toyohashi, Aichi]] with [[Tatsuno Station (Nagano)|Tatsuno Station]] in [[Tatsuno, Nagano]], operated by [[Central Japan Railway Company]] (JR Central).

2014}}\nThe Toyokawa Railway opened the section from Toyohashi to Toyokawa in 1897, extending the line to Omi in 1900. At the northern end, the Ina Electric Railway opened the Tatsuno to Ina-Matsushima section (electrified at 1,200 V DC) in 1909, extending the line to Tenryukyo in sections between 1911 and 1927. The Horaitera Railway opened the Omi to Mikawa-Kawai section in 1923, and electrified it at 1,500 V DC in 1925 in conjunction with the electrification of the Toyohashi to Omi section the same year. The Toyohashi to Toyokawa section was double-tracked the following year. The Sanshin Railway opened the Tenryukyo to Kadoshima section as an electrified (1,500 V DC) line in 1932, the Mikawa-Kawai to Toei section (and all subsequent stages) as an electrified line in 1933, and connected the two sections (completing the line) in 1936. All four companies were nationalised in 1943.\n\nIn 1955, the overhead line voltage of the Tatsuno to Tenryukyo section was increased to 1,500 V DC.\n\nCTC signalling was commissioned on the line between 1983 and 1984, and freight services ceased in 1996.\n\n===Former connecting lines===\n* Hon-Nagashino Station: A 23&nbsp;km line to Mikawa-Taguchi, electrified at 1,500 V DC, opened between 1930 and 1932. Two 762mm gauge forest railways connected to this line: the Damine forest railway, which connected at the station of the same name, consisted of a 19&nbsp;km 'main line' (including a tunnel) and a 7&nbsp;km branch, operated between 1932 and 1960; the Taguchi forest railway connected at the terminus station, consisted of a 10&nbsp;km 'main line' and a 6&nbsp;km branch, operated between 1934 and 1963. Both forest railways were notable for initially employing people and \"large dogs\" to haul the empty wagons upgrade, which then rolled downhill when loaded. The Mikawa-Taguchi line closed following flood damage in 1968.\n\n===Proposed connecting line===\n* Chubu-Tenryu Station: Construction started on a 35&nbsp;km line to Tenryu-Futamata on the [[Tenryu Hamanako Railroad Tenryu Hamanako Line|Hamanako Line]] in 1967. Proposed to involve 20 bridges and 14 tunnels, about 13&nbsp;km of roadbed, and about 50% of the overall work had been completed when construction was abandoned in 1980.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of railway lines in Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Iida Line}}\n* [http://jr-central.co.jp/ JR Central official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070821011100/http://jr-central.co.jp/eng.nsf/ JR Central official website]\n\n{{Nagoya transit}}\n{{Nagano transit}}\n{{Central Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n[[Category:Iida Line]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1897]]\n", "name_user": "Hkbusfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove irrelevant link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iida_Line"}
{"title_page": "Natural-language generation", "text_new": "'''Natural-language generation''' ('''NLG''') is a software process that transforms structured data into natural language.  It can be used to produce long form content for organizations to automate custom reports, as well as produce custom content for a web or mobile application. It can also be used to generate short blurbs of text in interactive conversations (a [[chatbot]]) which might even be read out  by a [[text-to-speech]] system.\n\nAutomated NLG can be compared to the process humans use when they turn ideas into writing or speech. [[Psycholinguists]] prefer the term [[language production]] for this process, which can also be described in mathematical terms, or modeled in a computer for psychological research.  NLG systems can also be compared to [[Translator (computing)|translators]] of artificial computer languages, such as [[decompiler]]s or [[transpiler]]s, which also produce human-readable code generated from an [[intermediate representation]]. Human languages tend to be considerably more complex and allow for much more ambiguity and variety of expression than programming languages, which makes NLG more challenging.\n\nNLG may be viewed as the opposite of [[natural-language understanding]]: whereas in natural-language understanding, the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, in NLG the system needs to make decisions about how to put a concept into words.  The practical considerations in building NLU vs. NLG systems are not symmetrical.  NLU needs to deal with ambiguous or erroneous user input, whereas the ideas the system wants to express through NLG are generally known precisely. NLG needs to choose a specific, self-consistent textual representation from many potential representations, whereas NLU generally tries to produce a single, normalized representation of the idea expressed.<ref name=\"Ehud\" />\n\nNLG has existed for a long time{{when|date=March 2019}} but commercial NLG technology has only recently{{when|date=March 2019}} become widely available. NLG techniques range from simple template-based systems like a [[mail merge]] that generates [[form letter]]s, to systems that have a complex understanding of human grammar.  NLG can also be accomplished by training a statistical model using [[machine learning]], typically on a large [[Text corpus|corpus]] of human-written texts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Perera R, Nand P |title=Recent Advances in Natural Language Generation: A Survey and Classification of the Empirical Literature |journal=Computing and Informatics |volume=36 |pages=1\u201332 |year=2017 |issue=1 |doi=10.4149/cai_2017_1_1 }}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe ''Pollen Forecast for Scotland'' system<ref>R Turner, S Sripada, E Reiter, I Davy (2006). [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E06-2020 Generating Spatio-Temporal Descriptions in Pollen Forecasts.] ''Proceedings of EACL06''</ref> is a simple example of a simple NLG system that could essentially be a template.  This system takes as input six numbers, which give predicted pollen levels in different parts of Scotland.  From these numbers, the system generates a short textual summary of pollen levels as its output.\n\nFor example, using the historical data for July 1, 2005, the software produces:\n<blockquote>\nGrass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country. However, in Northern areas, pollen levels will be moderate with values of 4.\n</blockquote>\nIn contrast, the actual forecast (written by a human meteorologist) from this data was:\n<blockquote>\nPollen counts are expected to remain high at level 6 over most of Scotland, and even level 7 in the south east. The only relief is in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland with medium levels of pollen count.\n</blockquote>\nComparing these two illustrates some of the choices that NLG systems must make; these are further discussed below.\n\n==Stages==\nThe process to generate text can be as simple as keeping a list of canned text that is copied and pasted, possibly linked with some glue text. The results may be satisfactory in simple domains such as horoscope machines or generators of personalised business letters. However, a sophisticated NLG system needs to include stages of planning and merging of information to enable the generation of text that looks natural and does not become repetitive. The typical stages of natural-language generation, as proposed by Dale and Reiter,<ref name=\"Ehud\">{{cite book |title=Building natural language generation systems |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=978-0-521-02451-8 |last1=Dale |first1=Robert |last2=Reiter |first2= Ehud |year=2000}}</ref> are:\n\n'''[[Content determination]]''': Deciding what information to mention in the text.\nFor instance, in the pollen example above, deciding whether to explicitly mention that pollen\nlevel is 7 in the south east.\n\n'''[[Document structuring]]''': Overall organisation of the information to convey.  For example, deciding to\ndescribe the areas with high pollen levels first, instead of the areas with low pollen levels.\n\n'''[[Aggregation (linguistics)|Aggregation]]''': Merging of similar sentences to improve readability and naturalness.\nFor instance, merging the two following sentences:\n*''Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday'' and\n*''Grass pollen levels will be around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country'' \ninto the following single sentence:\n*''Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country''.\n\n'''[[Lexical choice]]''': Putting words to the concepts.  For example, deciding whether ''medium'' or ''moderate''\nshould be used when describing a pollen level of 4.\n\n'''[[Referring expression generation]]''': Creating [[referring expression]]s that identify objects and regions.  For example, deciding to use\n''in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland'' to refer to a certain region in Scotland.\nThis task also includes making decisions about [[pronouns]] and other types of\n[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]].\n\n'''[[realization (linguistics)|Realization]]''': Creating the actual text, which should be correct\naccording to the rules of\n[[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[orthography]].  For example, using ''will be'' for the future\ntense of ''to be''.\n<!-- Talk about the typical stages of an NLG system -->\n<!-- Indicate some possible applications: report generation of stock exchange news or weather forecasts, for example -->\n\nAn alternative approach to NLG is to use \"end-to-end\" machine learning to build a system, without having separate stages as above.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/ | title=E2E NLG Challenge}}</ref>   In other words, we build an NLG system by training a machine learning algorithm (often an [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]]) on a large data set of input data and corresponding (human-written) output texts.

These include [http://narrativescience.com/quill Narrative Science], [http://phrasetech.com/ Phrasetech], [[Arria NLG]], [[Automated Insights]], [[Retresco]], [http://www.visualnlg.com/ Visual NLG], [[Yseop]] and [http://unitedrobots.ai/ United Robots]. Open-source NLG solutions exist as well, for instance [https://rosaenlg.org RosaeNLG], [https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg SimpleNLG] and [[The RiTa Toolkit]].\n\n==Evaluation==\nAs in other scientific fields, NLG researchers need to test how well their systems, modules, and algorithms work.  This is called ''evaluation''. There are three basic techniques for evaluating NLG systems:\n* ''Task-based (extrinsic) evaluation'': give the generated text to a person, and assess how well it helps him perform a task (or otherwise achieves its communicative goal).  For example, a system which generates summaries of medical data can be evaluated by giving these summaries to doctors, and assessing whether the summaries helps doctors make better decisions.<ref name=portet/>\n* ''Human ratings'': give the generated text to a person, and ask him or her to rate the quality and usefulness of the text.\n* ''Metrics'': compare generated texts to texts written by people from the same input data, using an automatic metric such as [[BLEU]].\n\nAn ultimate goal is how useful NLG systems are at helping people, which is the first of the above techniques. However, task-based evaluations are time-consuming and expensive, and can be difficult to carry out (especially if they require subjects with specialised expertise, such as doctors).

It can be used to produce long form content for organizations to automate custom reports, as well as produce custom content for a web or mobile application. It can also be used to generate short blurbs of text in interactive conversations (a [[chatbot]]) which might even be read out  by a [[text-to-speech]] system.\n\nAutomated NLG can be compared to the process humans use when they turn ideas into writing or speech. [[Psycholinguists]] prefer the term [[language production]] for this process, which can also be described in mathematical terms, or modeled in a computer for psychological research.  NLG systems can also be compared to [[Translator (computing)|translators]] of artificial computer languages, such as [[decompiler]]s or [[transpiler]]s, which also produce human-readable code generated from an [[intermediate representation]]. Human languages tend to be considerably more complex and allow for much more ambiguity and variety of expression than programming languages, which makes NLG more challenging.\n\nNLG may be viewed as the opposite of [[natural-language understanding]]: whereas in natural-language understanding, the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, in NLG the system needs to make decisions about how to put a concept into words.  The practical considerations in building NLU vs. NLG systems are not symmetrical.  NLU needs to deal with ambiguous or erroneous user input, whereas the ideas the system wants to express through NLG are generally known precisely. NLG needs to choose a specific, self-consistent textual representation from many potential representations, whereas NLU generally tries to produce a single, normalized representation of the idea expressed.<ref name=\"Ehud\" />\n\nNLG has existed for a long time{{when|date=March 2019}} but commercial NLG technology has only recently{{when|date=March 2019}} become widely available. NLG techniques range from simple template-based systems like a [[mail merge]] that generates [[form letter]]s, to systems that have a complex understanding of human grammar.  NLG can also be accomplished by training a statistical model using [[machine learning]], typically on a large [[Text corpus|corpus]] of human-written texts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Perera R, Nand P |title=Recent Advances in Natural Language Generation: A Survey and Classification of the Empirical Literature |journal=Computing and Informatics |volume=36 |pages=1\u201332 |year=2017 |issue=1 |doi=10.4149/cai_2017_1_1 }}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe ''Pollen Forecast for Scotland'' system<ref>R Turner, S Sripada, E Reiter, I Davy (2006). [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E06-2020 Generating Spatio-Temporal Descriptions in Pollen Forecasts.] ''Proceedings of EACL06''</ref> is a simple example of a simple NLG system that could essentially be a template.  This system takes as input six numbers, which give predicted pollen levels in different parts of Scotland.  From these numbers, the system generates a short textual summary of pollen levels as its output.\n\nFor example, using the historical data for July 1, 2005, the software produces:\n<blockquote>\nGrass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country. However, in Northern areas, pollen levels will be moderate with values of 4.\n</blockquote>\nIn contrast, the actual forecast (written by a human meteorologist) from this data was:\n<blockquote>\nPollen counts are expected to remain high at level 6 over most of Scotland, and even level 7 in the south east. The only relief is in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland with medium levels of pollen count.\n</blockquote>\nComparing these two illustrates some of the choices that NLG systems must make; these are further discussed below.\n\n==Stages==\nThe process to generate text can be as simple as keeping a list of canned text that is copied and pasted, possibly linked with some glue text. The results may be satisfactory in simple domains such as horoscope machines or generators of personalised business letters. However, a sophisticated NLG system needs to include stages of planning and merging of information to enable the generation of text that looks natural and does not become repetitive. The typical stages of natural-language generation, as proposed by Dale and Reiter,<ref name=\"Ehud\">{{cite book |title=Building natural language generation systems |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=978-0-521-02451-8 |last1=Dale |first1=Robert |last2=Reiter |first2= Ehud |year=2000}}</ref> are:\n\n'''[[Content determination]]''': Deciding what information to mention in the text.\nFor instance, in the pollen example above, deciding whether to explicitly mention that pollen\nlevel is 7 in the south east.\n\n'''[[Document structuring]]''': Overall organisation of the information to convey.  For example, deciding to\ndescribe the areas with high pollen levels first, instead of the areas with low pollen levels.\n\n'''[[Aggregation (linguistics)|Aggregation]]''': Merging of similar sentences to improve readability and naturalness.\nFor instance, merging the two following sentences:\n*''Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday'' and\n*''Grass pollen levels will be around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country'' \ninto the following single sentence:\n*''Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country''.\n\n'''[[Lexical choice]]''': Putting words to the concepts.  For example, deciding whether ''medium'' or ''moderate''\nshould be used when describing a pollen level of 4.\n\n'''[[Referring expression generation]]''': Creating [[referring expression]]s that identify objects and regions.  For example, deciding to use\n''in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland'' to refer to a certain region in Scotland.\nThis task also includes making decisions about [[pronouns]] and other types of\n[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]].\n\n'''[[realization (linguistics)|Realization]]''': Creating the actual text, which should be correct\naccording to the rules of\n[[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[orthography]].

This is called ''evaluation''. There are three basic techniques for evaluating NLG systems:\n* ''Task-based (extrinsic) evaluation'': give the generated text to a person, and assess how well it helps him perform a task (or otherwise achieves its communicative goal).  For example, a system which generates summaries of medical data can be evaluated by giving these summaries to doctors, and assessing whether the summaries helps doctors make better decisions.<ref name=portet/>\n* ''Human ratings'': give the generated text to a person, and ask him or her to rate the quality and usefulness of the text.\n* ''Metrics'': compare generated texts to texts written by people from the same input data, using an automatic metric such as [[BLEU]].\n\nAn ultimate goal is how useful NLG systems are at helping people, which is the first of the above techniques. However, task-based evaluations are time-consuming and expensive, and can be difficult to carry out (especially if they require subjects with specialised expertise, such as doctors).  Hence (as in other areas of NLP) task-based evaluations are the exception, not the norm.\n\nRecently researchers are assessing how well human-ratings and metrics correlate with (predict) task-based evaluations.  Work is being conducted in the context of Generation Challenges<ref>[http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/ Generation Challenges 2009]</ref> shared-task events.
