As of 2013, it has a population of 51,727 inhabitants, while the city of Gradi\u0161ka has a population of 14,368 inhabitants.\n\nIt is geographically located in eastern [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]] region, and the town is situated on the [[Lijev\u010de]] plain, on the right bank of the [[Sava]] river across from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Croatia]], and about {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Banja Luka]].\n\n==History==\nIn the Roman period this town was of strategic importance; a port of the Roman fleet was situated here. Among notable archaeological findings are a [[viaduct]].\n\n'''Gradi\u0161ki Brod''' is mentioned for the first time as a town in {{circa}} 1330. It had a major importance as the location where the [[Sava|Sava river]] used to be crossed. By 1537, the town and its surroundings came under Ottoman rule.\n\nThe Ottoman built a fortress, which served as the [[Bosnia Eyalet]]'s northern defense line. The town was also called '''Berbir''' because of the fortress.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804), in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (modern [[Central Serbia]]), the  ''[[Jan\u010di\u0107's Revolt]]'' broke out in the Gradi\u0161ka region against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] in the [[Bosnia Eyalet]], following the erosion of the economic, national and religious rights of Serbs. [[Hajduk]]s also arrived from Serbia, and were especially active on the [[Kozara]]. [[Jovan Jan\u010di\u0107 Sarajlija]] organized the uprising with help from Metropolitan [[Benedikt Kraljevi\u0107]]. The peasants took up arms on 23 September 1809, in the region of Gradi\u0161ka, beginning from [[Ma\u0161i\u0107i,Gradi\u0161ka|Ma\u0161i\u0107i]]. The fighting began on 25 September, and on the same night, the Ottomans captured and executed Jan\u010di\u0107. The rebels retreated to their villages, except those in Kozara and Motajica who continued, and offered strong resistance until their defeat in mid-October, after extensive looting and burning of villages by the Ottomans.<ref>\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d \u0411\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043b\u0438\u045b. \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u045b\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u043d\u0430. \u0412\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0440. 107 \u0441\u0442. 5, 1933.

[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ended in 1918, when the South Slavic Austro-Hungarian territories proclaimed the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which subsequently joined the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941 Gradi\u0161ka was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nDuring [[Yugoslavia]], the town was known as ''Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka'' (''\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430''). During the [[Bosnian War]], the town was incorporated into [[Republika Srpska]] ({{abbreviation|RS|Republika Srpska}}). After the war, the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|RS National Assembly]] changed the name, omitting ''bosanska'' (\"Bosnian\"), as was done with many other towns ([[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]], [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Dubica]], [[Novi Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Novi Grad]], [[Petrovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrovo]], [[\u0160amac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|\u0160amac]]).\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Gradi\u0161ka, the municipality includes total of 74 other settlements:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Ad\u017ei\u0107i]]\n* [[Baraji]]\n* [[Berek (Gradi\u0161ka)|Berek]]\n* [[Bistrica (Gradi\u0161ka)|Bistrica]]\n* [[Bok Jankovac]]\n* [[Brestov\u010dina]]\n* [[Bukovac (Gradi\u0161ka)|Bukovac]]\n* [[Bukvik]]\n* [[Cerovljani]]\n* [[Cimiroti]]\n* [[\u010catrnja]]\n* [[\u010celinovac]]\n* [[\u010cikule]]\n* [[Donja Dolina]]\n* [[Donja Jurkovica]]\n* [[Donji Karajzovci]]\n* [[Donji Podgradci]]\n* [[Dragelji]]\n* [[Dubrave (Gradi\u0161ka)|Dubrave]]\n* [[Du\u0161anovo]]\n* [[Elezagi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ga\u0161nica]]\n* [[Gornja Dolina]]\n* [[Gornja Jurkovica]]\n* [[Gornja Lipova\u010da]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Gornji Karajzovci]]\n* [[Gornji Podgradci]]\n* [[Grbavci (Gradi\u0161ka)|Grbavci]]\n* [[Greda (Gradi\u0161ka)|Greda]]\n* [[Jablanica (Gradi\u0161ka)|Jablanica]]\n* [[Jazovac]]\n* [[Jeli\u0107i (Gradi\u0161ka)|Jeli\u0107i]]\n* [[Kijevci, Gradi\u0161ka|Kijevci]]\n* [[Ko\u010di\u0107evo (Gradi\u0161ka)|Ko\u010di\u0107evo]]\n* [[Kozara (Gradi\u0161ka)|Kozara]]\n* [[Kozinci]]\n* [[Kraj\u010dinovci]]\n* [[Kraji\u0161nik (Gradi\u0161ka)|Kraji\u0161nik]]\n* [[Kru\u0161kik]]\n* [[Laminci Brezici]]\n* [[Laminci Dubrave]]\n* [[Laminci Jaru\u017eani]]\n* [[Laminci Sre\u0111ani]]\n* [[Liskovac (Gradi\u0161ka)|Liskovac]]\n* [[Lu\u017eani (Gradi\u0161ka)|Lu\u017eani]]\n* [[Ma\u010dkovac (Gradi\u0161ka)|Ma\u010dkovac]]\n* [[Ma\u0161i\u0107i (Gradi\u0161ka)|Ma\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Mi\u010dije]]\n* [[Milo\u0161evo Brdo]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Miljevi\u0107i (Gradi\u0161ka)|Miljevi\u0107i]]\n* [[Mokrice, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Mokrice]]\n* [[Nova Topola, Gradi\u0161ka|Nova Topola]]\n* [[Novo Selo (Gradi\u0161ka)|Novo Selo]]\n* [[Orahova]]\n* [[Orubica]]\n* [[Petrovo Selo (Gradi\u0161ka)|Petrovo Selo]]\n* [[Rogolji]]\n* [[Romanovci]]\n* [[Rovine (Gradi\u0161ka)|Rovine]]\n* [[Samard\u017eije]]\n* [[Seferovci]]\n* [[Sovjak]]\n* [[Srednja Jurkovica]]\n* [[\u0160a\u0161kinovci]]\n* [[\u0160imi\u0107i]]\n* [[Trebovljani]]\n* [[Trnovac (Gradi\u0161ka)|Trnovac]]\n* [[Tro\u0161elji]]\n* [[Turjak (Gradi\u0161ka)|Turjak]]\n* [[Uzari]]\n* [[Vakuf (Gradi\u0161ka)|Vakuf]]\n* [[Vilusi (Gradi\u0161ka)|Vilusi]]\n* [[Vrba\u0161ka]]\n* [[\u017deravica]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As of 2013, it has a population of 51,727 inhabitants, while the city of Gradi\u0161ka has a population of 14,368 inhabitants.\n\nIt is geographically located in eastern [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]] region, and the town is situated on the [[Lijev\u010de]] plain, on the right bank of the [[Sava]] river across from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Croatia]], and about {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Banja Luka]].\n\n==History==\nIn the Roman period this town was of strategic importance; a port of the Roman fleet was situated here. Among notable archaeological findings are a [[viaduct]].\n\n'''Gradi\u0161ki Brod''' is mentioned for the first time as a town in {{circa}} 1330. It had a major importance as the location where the [[Sava|Sava river]] used to be crossed. By 1537, the town and its surroundings came under Ottoman rule.\n\nThe Ottoman built a fortress, which served as the [[Bosnia Eyalet]]'s northern defense line. The town was also called '''Berbir''' because of the fortress.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804), in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (modern [[Central Serbia]]), the  ''[[Jan\u010di\u0107's Revolt]]'' broke out in the Gradi\u0161ka region against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] in the [[Bosnia Eyalet]], following the erosion of the economic, national and religious rights of Serbs. [[Hajduk]]s also arrived from Serbia, and were especially active on the [[Kozara]]. [[Jovan Jan\u010di\u0107 Sarajlija]] organized the uprising with help from Metropolitan [[Benedikt Kraljevi\u0107]]. The peasants took up arms on 23 September 1809, in the region of Gradi\u0161ka, beginning from [[Ma\u0161i\u0107i,Gradi\u0161ka|Ma\u0161i\u0107i]]. The fighting began on 25 September, and on the same night, the Ottomans captured and executed Jan\u010di\u0107. The rebels retreated to their villages, except those in Kozara and Motajica who continued, and offered strong resistance until their defeat in mid-October, after extensive looting and burning of villages by the Ottomans.<ref>\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d \u0411\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043b\u0438\u045b. \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u045b\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u043d\u0430. \u0412\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0440. 107 \u0441\u0442. 5, 1933.

[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ended in 1918, when the South Slavic Austro-Hungarian territories proclaimed the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which subsequently joined the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941 Gradi\u0161ka was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nDuring [[Yugoslavia]], the town was known as ''Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka'' (''\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430'').

Due to its outstanding elevation that nears {{cvt|3,000|m}}, the town receives larger diurnal ranges and more precipitation compared to the capital nearby [[Sanaa]]. The plentiful rainfall is a direct result to its exposed location (not shielded by any natural barriers) being on top of a mountain and its rugged terrain; both factors leading to occasional [[orographic lifts]] rising from nearby slopes. \n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n| location = Kawkaban\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 22.2 \n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 25.5\n| Apr high C = 26.3\n| May high C = 28.3\n| Jun high C = 30.0\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 27.2\n| Sep high C = 27.3\n| Oct high C = 26.2\n| Nov high C = 23.5\n| Dec high C = 22.2\n| year high C = 25.6\n\n| Jan mean C = 14.0\n| Feb mean C = 14.9\n| Mar mean C = 17.3\n| Apr mean C = 18.7\n| May mean C = 20.6\n| Jun mean C = 21.9\n| Jul mean C = 22.1\n| Aug mean C = 20.9\n| Sep mean C = 20.2\n| Oct mean C = 18.5\n| Nov mean C = 16.3\n| Dec mean C = 14.7\n| year mean C = 18.3\n\n| Jan low C = 5.9 \n| Feb low C = 6.5\n| Mar low C = 9.2\n| Apr low C = 11.1\n| May low C = 13.0\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 15.7\n| Aug low C = 14.7\n| Sep low C = 13.1\n| Oct low C = 10.9\n| Nov low C = 9.1\n| Dec low C = 7.2\n| year low C = 10.9\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm=7\n|Feb precipitation mm=8\n|Mar precipitation mm=15\n|Apr precipitation mm=38\n|May precipitation mm=46\n|Jun precipitation mm=17\n|Jul precipitation mm=82\n|Aug precipitation mm=112\n|Sep precipitation mm=41\n|Oct precipitation mm=8\n|Nov precipitation mm=6\n|Dec precipitation mm=1\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.org<ref>{{cite web\n|url = https://en.climate-data.org/location/533157/\n|title = Climate: Kawkaban -

Due to its outstanding elevation that nears {{cvt|3,000|m}}, the town receives larger diurnal ranges and more precipitation compared to the capital nearby [[Sanaa]]. The plentiful rainfall is a direct result to its exposed location (not shielded by any natural barriers) being on top of a mountain and its rugged terrain; both factors leading to occasional [[orographic lifts]] rising from nearby slopes. \n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n| location = Kawkaban\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 22.2 \n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 25.5\n| Apr high C = 26.3\n| May high C = 28.3\n| Jun high C = 30.0\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 27.2\n| Sep high C = 27.3\n| Oct high C = 26.2\n| Nov high C = 23.5\n| Dec high C = 22.2\n| year high C = 25.6\n\n| Jan mean C = 14.0\n| Feb mean C = 14.9\n| Mar mean C = 17.3\n| Apr mean C = 18.7\n| May mean C = 20.6\n| Jun mean C = 21.9\n| Jul mean C = 22.1\n| Aug mean C = 20.9\n| Sep mean C = 20.2\n| Oct mean C = 18.5\n| Nov mean C = 16.3\n| Dec mean C = 14.7\n| year mean C = 18.3\n\n| Jan low C = 5.9 \n| Feb low C = 6.5\n| Mar low C = 9.2\n| Apr low C = 11.1\n| May low C = 13.0\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 15.7\n| Aug low C = 14.7\n| Sep low C = 13.1\n| Oct low C = 10.9\n| Nov low C = 9.1\n| Dec low C = 7.2\n| year low C = 10.9\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm=7\n|Feb precipitation mm=8\n|Mar precipitation mm=15\n|Apr precipitation mm=38\n|May precipitation mm=46\n|Jun precipitation mm=17\n|Jul precipitation mm=82\n|Aug precipitation mm=112\n|Sep precipitation mm=41\n|Oct precipitation mm=8\n|Nov precipitation mm=6\n|Dec precipitation mm=1\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.org<ref>{{cite web\n|url = https://en.climate-data.org/location/533157/\n|title = Climate: Kawkaban - Climate-Data.org\n|accessdate = 3 November 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yemeni cities}}\n{{Sana'a Governorate}}\n\n{{Yemen-geo-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Sana'a Governorate]]\n", "name_user": "Leo1pard", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClimate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawkaban"}

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

Situated in the far northwest of the country, it lies across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] from the [[Croatia]]n town of [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]]. {{As of|2013||alt=According to the 2013 census|df=}}, the town has a population of 11,063 while its municipality comprises a total of 27,115 inhabitants. \n\nKnown for its scenic quay, Novi Grad lies at the confluence of the Una and [[Sana (river)|Sana]] rivers.\n\n==Geography==\nNovi Grad is located on the right bank of the Una and both banks of the Sana, between two geographic zones: the slopes of the mountains of [[Grme\u010d]] and [[Kozara]], and the alluvial land surrounding the town's two rivers. The town itself is located {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea level, at nearly 45\u00b0N; the climate is temperate-continental. Its governed municipality covers an area of {{convert|470|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\nThe town was first mentioned in 1280 under the Latin name ''Castrum Novum'' which, literally translated, means 'new fort'. It belonged to the dukes of Blagaj and in the early sixteenth century came under power of [[Nikola Zrinski]]. Croatian ban Adam Ba\u010dan conquered Novi in 1693.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106\nSTARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf\n#page=36 </ref> [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] on his journey through Bosnia mentions that Croatian nobles built Novi Grad.  <ref>Hazim \u0160abanovi\u0107, Putopis : odlomci o jugoslavenskim zemljama, 1967,\nhttps://www.academia.edu/6486045/Evlija_Celebi_Putopis #page=219</ref>  In 1895, during [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the town was officially given the name 'Bosanski Novi'. At the same time, the city included around 3,300 people with 550 households. Wooden bridges existed across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana river|Sana]] rivers which the citizens had to guard against floods in the autumn and spring. For that reason, a current-day symbol of the town was built in 1906\u2014the Una quay. \n\nIn 1872, Novi Grad was the first municipality to have a train station on the new Bosnian railway, which afforded it significant cultural and economic advantages over other [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]<ref name=\"fg\">[http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= Krajina, official name of region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607112746/http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= |date=2015-06-07 }}</ref>  municipalities. The first hospital was established around the same time.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Novi Grad was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 1995, the town was ethnically cleansed of its Bosniak and Croat inhabitants, thereby rendering it almost completely Serb-populated. In order to distance the town from its Bosnian history and its cultural roots and in tune with the war politics, the local Serb government renamed the town to Novi Grad, a change criticized by Croat and Bosniak residents. Consequently, majority of people from Bosanski Novi were misplaced and live all over Europe, the American continent, Australia and elsewhere around the globe. \n\nAfter the [[Bosnian war]], [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]] was split from the municipality.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Novi Grad, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ahmetovci]]\n* [[Blagaj Japra]]\n* [[Blagaj Rijeka]]\n* [[Blatna]]\n* [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]]\n* [[Cerovica (Novi Grad)|Cerovica]]\n* [[Crna Rijeka (Novi Grad)|Crna Rijeka]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Donja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Donja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja]]\n* [[\u0106ele]]\n* [[Devetaci (Novi Grad)|Devetaci]]\n* [[Dobrljin]]\n* [[Donje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Donji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Donji Rakani]]\n* [[Gornja Slabinja]]\n* [[Gornje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Gornji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornji Rakani]]\n* [[Graba\u0161nica]]\n* [[Grdanovac]]\n* [[Gumnjani]]\n* [[Hozi\u0107i (Novi Grad)|Hozi\u0107i]]\n* [[Johovica (Novi Grad)|Johovica]]\n* [[Jo\u0161ava]]\n* [[Kalenderi]]\n* [[Kr\u0161lje]]\n* [[Kuljani (Novi Grad)|Kuljani]]\n* [[Lje\u0161ljani]]\n* [[Mala Krupska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala Novska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Maslovare (Novi Grad)|Maslovare]]\n* [[Matavazi]]\n* [[Mazi\u0107]]\n* [[Mrakodol]]\n* [[Mraovo Polje]]\n* [[Petkovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petkovac]]\n* [[Petrinja, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrinja]]\n* [[Pobr\u0111ani (Novi Grad)|Pobr\u0111ani]]\n* [[Podo\u0161ka]]\n* [[Poljavnice]]\n* [[Prusci]]\n* [[Radomirovac]]\n* [[Rakovac (Novi Grad)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Ra\u0161\u0107e]]\n* [[Ravnice, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ravnice]]\n* [[Rudice]]\n* [[Sokoli\u0161te]]\n* [[Suha\u010da (Novi Grad)|Suha\u010da]]\n* [[Svodna]]\n* [[Tavija]]\n* [[Trgovi\u0161te, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trgovi\u0161te]]\n* [[Vedovica]]\n* [[Velika Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Velika \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Vitasavci]]\n* [[Zovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zovik]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Autumn in Novi Grad.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Autumn in Novi Grad]]\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Herzegovina]]. Situated in the far northwest of the country, it lies across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] from the [[Croatia]]n town of [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]]. {{As of|2013||alt=According to the 2013 census|df=}}, the town has a population of 11,063 while its municipality comprises a total of 27,115 inhabitants. \n\nKnown for its scenic quay, Novi Grad lies at the confluence of the Una and [[Sana (river)|Sana]] rivers. \n\n==Geography==\nNovi Grad is located on the right bank of the Una and both banks of the Sana, between two geographic zones: the slopes of the mountains of [[Grme\u010d]] and [[Kozara]], and the alluvial land surrounding the town's two rivers. The town itself is located {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea level, at nearly 45\u00b0N; the climate is temperate-continental. Its governed municipality covers an area of {{convert|470|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\nThe town was first mentioned in 1280 under the Latin name ''Castrum Novum'' which, literally translated, means 'new fort'. It belonged to the dukes of Blagaj and in the early sixteenth century came under power of [[Nikola Zrinski]]. Croatian ban Adam Ba\u010dan conquered Novi in 1693.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106\nSTARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf\n#page=36 </ref> [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] on his journey through Bosnia mentions that Croatian nobles built Novi Grad.  <ref>Hazim \u0160abanovi\u0107, Putopis : odlomci o jugoslavenskim zemljama, 1967,\nhttps://www.academia.edu/6486045/Evlija_Celebi_Putopis #page=219</ref>  In 1895, during [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the town was officially given the name 'Bosanski Novi'. At the same time, the city included around 3,300 people with 550 households. Wooden bridges existed across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana river|Sana]] rivers which the citizens had to guard against floods in the autumn and spring. For that reason, a current-day symbol of the town was built in 1906\u2014the Una quay. \n\nIn 1872, Novi Grad was the first municipality to have a train station on the new Bosnian railway, which afforded it significant cultural and economic advantages over other [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]<ref name=\"fg\">[http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= Krajina, official name of region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607112746/http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= |date=2015-06-07 }}</ref>  municipalities. The first hospital was established around the same time.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Novi Grad was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 1995, the town was ethnically cleansed of its Bosniak and Croat inhabitants, thereby rendering it almost completely Serb-populated. In order to distance the town from its Bosnian history and its cultural roots and in tune with the war politics, the local Serb government renamed the town to Novi Grad, a change criticized by Croat and Bosniak residents. Consequently, majority of people from Bosanski Novi were misplaced and live all over Europe, the American continent, Australia and elsewhere around the globe. \n\nAfter the [[Bosnian war]], [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]] was split from the municipality.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Novi Grad, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ahmetovci]]\n* [[Blagaj Japra]]\n* [[Blagaj Rijeka]]\n* [[Blatna]]\n* [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]]\n* [[Cerovica (Novi Grad)|Cerovica]]\n* [[Crna Rijeka (Novi Grad)|Crna Rijeka]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Donja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Donja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja]]\n* [[\u0106ele]]\n* [[Devetaci (Novi Grad)|Devetaci]]\n* [[Dobrljin]]\n* [[Donje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Donji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Donji Rakani]]\n* [[Gornja Slabinja]]\n* [[Gornje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Gornji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornji Rakani]]\n* [[Graba\u0161nica]]\n* [[Grdanovac]]\n* [[Gumnjani]]\n* [[Hozi\u0107i (Novi Grad)|Hozi\u0107i]]\n* [[Johovica (Novi Grad)|Johovica]]\n* [[Jo\u0161ava]]\n* [[Kalenderi]]\n* [[Kr\u0161lje]]\n* [[Kuljani (Novi Grad)|Kuljani]]\n* [[Lje\u0161ljani]]\n* [[Mala Krupska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala Novska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Maslovare (Novi Grad)|Maslovare]]\n* [[Matavazi]]\n* [[Mazi\u0107]]\n* [[Mrakodol]]\n* [[Mraovo Polje]]\n* [[Petkovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petkovac]]\n* [[Petrinja, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrinja]]\n* [[Pobr\u0111ani (Novi Grad)|Pobr\u0111ani]]\n* [[Podo\u0161ka]]\n* [[Poljavnice]]\n* [[Prusci]]\n* [[Radomirovac]]\n* [[Rakovac (Novi Grad)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Ra\u0161\u0107e]]\n* [[Ravnice, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ravnice]]\n* [[Rudice]]\n* [[Sokoli\u0161te]]\n* [[Suha\u010da (Novi Grad)|Suha\u010da]]\n* [[Svodna]]\n* [[Tavija]]\n* [[Trgovi\u0161te, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trgovi\u0161te]]\n* [[Vedovica]]\n* [[Velika Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Velika \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Vitasavci]]\n* [[Zovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zovik]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Autumn in Novi Grad.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Autumn in Novi Grad]]\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "Badan Standardisasi Nasional", "text_new": "{{2p|date=November 2019}}{{Advert|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe '''National Standardization Body''' of Indonesia ({{lang-id|Badan Nasional Standardisasi}}, BSN) is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) member body for [[Indonesia]].\n'''Badan''' '''Standardisasi''' '''Nasional''' is a non-ministerial Indonesian government agency with the main task of carrying out governmental tasks in the field of [[standardization]] and [[conformity assessment]] in Indonesia.\n\n==Tasks==\nThe following are the main tasks of BSN:\n#Facilitating stakeholders in developing and maintaining SNI. The process is carried out by the SNI Formulation Technical Committee consisting of representatives from producers, consumers, experts / universities, and the government. Determination of SNI is carried out by the Head of BSN through the Decree of the Head of BSN.\n#Actively involved in various International Organizations such as ISO, IEC, CAC, APEC, APLAC, ILAC, PAC, ASEAN, and so on. Active participation of BSN can be in the form of attending international standard formulation sessions in order to fight for the interests of Indonesia, as well as hosting the session / hosting.\n#As the secretariat of the National Accreditation Committee (KAN), which continues to develop accreditation and certification schemes and fight for mutual recognition internationally, allowing the results of certification and laboratory tests conducted by the Indonesian Conformity Assessment Agency to be recognized worldwide.\n#Encouraging the central government, regional governments, associations, industry, and universities to participate actively in developing and promoting SNI. The efforts of BSN to encourage stakeholders to jointly conduct standardization and conformity assessment activities, are formally formulated through the signing of the Cooperation Text (MOU).\n#Empowering business practitioners to implement SNI with various incentive and promotion programs as well as SNI Award for consistent and excellent business practitioners in applying SNI\n#Conducting research and testing of SNI products in the market, of which the results can be inputs for relevant Ministries that have the capacity to be market supervisors. The research activities conducted by BSN can also be included for SNI development and maintenance activities.\n#Providing standard information and sales services, both SNI and international standards\n#Organizing National Standards of Measurement Unit that enable metrological activities in Indonesia to be recognized by the world. [1]\n\n==Function==\n#Assessment and formulation of national policies in the field of national standardization;\n#Coordination of functional activities in implementing BSN tasks;\n#Facilitating and fostering the activities of government agencies in the field of national standardization;\n#Carrying out domestic and international cooperation activities in the field of standardization, and;\n#Implementation of guidance and general administrative services in the fields of general planning, administration, organization and governance, staffing, finance, filing, coding, equipment and household.\n\n==Authority==\nIn carrying out these functions, BSN has the authority of:\n\n#Macro national planning in the field;\n#Formulation of policies in its field to support macro development;\n#Determination of information systems in their fields;\n#Other authorities in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, namely:\n##formulation and implementation of certain policies in the field of national standardization;\n##formulation and stipulation of accreditation system policy of certification bodies, inspection bodies and laboratories;\n##stipulation of Indonesian National Standard (SNI);\n##conducting research and development in its fields;\n##organizing education and training in its fields.\n\n==History==\nThe establishment of BSN is inseparable from the long history of standardization in Indonesia, the development and application of standards began from the Dutch and Japanese colonial times, until after the independence proclamation which declared Indonesia to be officially sovereign. Standardization was used as a means of supporting colonial economic activities so that it could run smoothly. The official institution related to standardization activities began in 1928 in the Dutch East Indies, with the establishment of the Stichting Fonds voor de Normalisatie in Nederlands Indie (Normalization Foundation in the Indies) and the Normalization Road (Normalization Council) located in Bandung, Indonesia. Dutch engineers who were mostly civil engineers began to set standards for building materials, transportation equipment followed by electrical installation standards and requirements for external lines. During World War II and during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945) we could consider that formal standardization activities were halted. On August 17, 1945 Indonesia's independence was proclaimed. Indonesia immediately formed a government and planned development to improve the standard of living and welfare of the people towards equality with other countries.\n\nIn 1951 the amendment to the \"Raad Normalization\" statute was formed and the Indonesian Normalization Fund Foundation (YDNI) was formed. In 1955 YDNI represented Indonesia as a member of the ISO international standards organization and in 1966 YDNI successfully represented Indonesia as a member of the International Electrotechnical Commission / IEC.\n\nIn the field of standardization Law No. 10 of 1961 known as the \"Goods Act\". It turns out that this law has not been able to be a means of managing overall standardization activities. At that time, standardization activities were still sectoral, carried out by various departments, including the Ministry of Industry (Indonesian Industrial Standards), the Ministry of Trade (Trade Standards), the Ministry of Public Works (Indonesian Construction and Building Standards), the Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesian-Agriculture Agricultural Standards; Indonesian Agricultural Standards-Animal Husbandry), Ministry of Forestry (Indonesian Forestry Standards), as well as several government institutions / agencies.\n\nThe government began to place standardization as a strategic function in supporting national development. In 1973, the \"National System Development for Standardization\" program was established as a priority. In 1976, the National Standardization System Preparation Committee was formed. In 1984, with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Indonesia the National Standardization Board (DSN) was formed with the main task of establishing standardization policies, coordinating and fostering cooperation in the field of national standardization. The Chairperson of the National Standardization Board is held by the State Minister for Research and Technology, Prof. Dr. Ing. H. Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, FREng.\n\nThrough the struggle of the previous leadership, Alm. Ir. Herudi Kartowisastro, on March 27, 1997, the government dissolved the DSN which subsequently changed to the National Standardization Body. BSN itself is a Non-Ministry Government Institution (LPNK) that is given the task by the government to foster and coordinate all standardization and conformity assessment activities in Indonesia. The establishment of BSN was based on Presidential Decree No. 13 of 1997 perfected by Presidential Decree No. 166 of 2000 concerning Position, Duties, Functions, Authority, Organizational Structure and Work Procedures of Non-Departmental Government Institutions as amended several times, and the most recent by Presidential Decree No. 4 of 2018, concerning the National Standardization Agency.\n\nIn order to enhance the development of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI), the government established Government Regulation No. 102 of 2000 concerning National Standardization. On September 14, 2014, Law No. 20 of 2014 concerning Standardization and Conformity Assessment was stipulated. With the existence of this Law, the government will further strengthen the existence and role of BSN in the development process in Indonesia both in the context of physical development, efficient management of natural resources, and the development of highly competitive Indonesian people.\nWelcoming the era of globalization which demands high competitiveness, as well as the implementation of Law No. 20 of 2014, the BSN successfully reorganized itself to include a new structure namely the Deputy for the National Standard Measuring Unit (SNSU) in 2018. With the Deputy, BSN was more able to optimally implement the quality infrastructure (Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Metrology) in order to actualize a system that allows products to meet the quality and requirements of Safety, Security, Health, and Environmental Sustainability (K3L); life can be more comfortable, safe and orderly; the dignity of the nation will be lifted because Indonesia can compete more internationally.\n\n==Organization==\nThe National Standardization Agency Organization consists of the Chairman, Main Secretariat, Deputy for Standards Development, Deputy for Application of Standards and Conformity Assessment, Deputy for Accreditation, Deputy for National Standards for Measuring Units, Inspectorates, Research and Development Center for Human Resources, and Data and Systems Center Information.\n\n===Chairman of BSN===\nThe Chairman of BSN is under and directly responsible to the President of the Republic of Indonesia with the task of: \n#Leading the BSN in accordance with the legislation in force; \n#Preparing national policies and general policies in accordance with the duties of BSN; \n#Establishing technical policies for the tasks implementation of BSN as its responsibility; \n#Fostering and carrying out cooperation with other agencies and organizations.\n\n====Main Secretariat====\nThe Main Secretariat has the task of carrying out coordination of the implementation of tasks, coaching, and providing administrative support to all organizational units within the BSN.

The process is carried out by the SNI Formulation Technical Committee consisting of representatives from producers, consumers, experts / universities, and the government. Determination of SNI is carried out by the Head of BSN through the Decree of the Head of BSN.\n#Actively involved in various International Organizations such as ISO, IEC, CAC, APEC, APLAC, ILAC, PAC, ASEAN, and so on. Active participation of BSN can be in the form of attending international standard formulation sessions in order to fight for the interests of Indonesia, as well as hosting the session / hosting.\n#As the secretariat of the National Accreditation Committee (KAN), which continues to develop accreditation and certification schemes and fight for mutual recognition internationally, allowing the results of certification and laboratory tests conducted by the Indonesian Conformity Assessment Agency to be recognized worldwide.\n#Encouraging the central government, regional governments, associations, industry, and universities to participate actively in developing and promoting SNI. The efforts of BSN to encourage stakeholders to jointly conduct standardization and conformity assessment activities, are formally formulated through the signing of the Cooperation Text (MOU).\n#Empowering business practitioners to implement SNI with various incentive and promotion programs as well as SNI Award for consistent and excellent business practitioners in applying SNI\n#Conducting research and testing of SNI products in the market, of which the results can be inputs for relevant Ministries that have the capacity to be market supervisors. The research activities conducted by BSN can also be included for SNI development and maintenance activities.\n#Providing standard information and sales services, both SNI and international standards\n#Organizing National Standards of Measurement Unit that enable metrological activities in Indonesia to be recognized by the world. [1]\n\n=='''Function'''==\n#Assessment and formulation of national policies in the field of national standardization;\n#Coordination of functional activities in implementing BSN tasks;\n#Facilitating and fostering the activities of government agencies in the field of national standardization;\n#Carrying out domestic and international cooperation activities in the field of standardization, and;\n#Implementation of guidance and general administrative services in the fields of general planning, administration, organization and governance, staffing, finance, filing, coding, equipment and household.\n\n=='''Authority'''==\nIn carrying out these functions, BSN has the authority of:\n\n#Macro national planning in the field;\n#Formulation of policies in its field to support macro development;\n#Determination of information systems in their fields;\n#Other authorities in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, namely:\n##formulation and implementation of certain policies in the field of national standardization;\n##formulation and stipulation of accreditation system policy of certification bodies, inspection bodies and laboratories;\n##stipulation of Indonesian National Standard (SNI);\n##conducting research and development in its fields;\n##organizing education and training in its fields.\n\n=='''History'''==\nThe establishment of BSN is inseparable from the long history of standardization in Indonesia, the development and application of standards began from the Dutch and Japanese colonial times, until after the independence proclamation which declared Indonesia to be officially sovereign. Standardization was used as a means of supporting colonial economic activities so that it could run smoothly. The official institution related to standardization activities began in 1928 in the Dutch East Indies, with the establishment of the Stichting Fonds voor de Normalisatie in Nederlands Indie (Normalization Foundation in the Indies) and the Normalization Road (Normalization Council) located in Bandung, Indonesia. Dutch engineers who were mostly civil engineers began to set standards for building materials, transportation equipment followed by electrical installation standards and requirements for external lines. During World War II and during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945) we could consider that formal standardization activities were halted. On August 17, 1945 Indonesia's independence was proclaimed. Indonesia immediately formed a government and planned development to improve the standard of living and welfare of the people towards equality with other countries.\n\nIn 1951 the amendment to the \"Raad Normalization\" statute was formed and the Indonesian Normalization Fund Foundation (YDNI) was formed. In 1955 YDNI represented Indonesia as a member of the ISO international standards organization and in 1966 YDNI successfully represented Indonesia as a member of the International Electrotechnical Commission / IEC.\n\nIn the field of standardization Law No. 10 of 1961 known as the \"Goods Act\". It turns out that this law has not been able to be a means of managing overall standardization activities. At that time, standardization activities were still sectoral, carried out by various departments, including the Ministry of Industry (Indonesian Industrial Standards), the Ministry of Trade (Trade Standards), the Ministry of Public Works (Indonesian Construction and Building Standards), the Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesian-Agriculture Agricultural Standards; Indonesian Agricultural Standards-Animal Husbandry), Ministry of Forestry (Indonesian Forestry Standards), as well as several government institutions / agencies.\n\nThe government began to place standardization as a strategic function in supporting national development. In 1973, the \"National System Development for Standardization\" program was established as a priority. In 1976, the National Standardization System Preparation Committee was formed. In 1984, with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Indonesia the National Standardization Board (DSN) was formed with the main task of establishing standardization policies, coordinating and fostering cooperation in the field of national standardization. The Chairperson of the National Standardization Board is held by the State Minister for Research and Technology, Prof. Dr. Ing. H. Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, FREng.\n\nThrough the struggle of the previous leadership, Alm. Ir. Herudi Kartowisastro, on March 27, 1997, the government dissolved the DSN which subsequently changed to the National Standardization Body. BSN itself is a Non-Ministry Government Institution (LPNK) that is given the task by the government to foster and coordinate all standardization and conformity assessment activities in Indonesia. The establishment of BSN was based on Presidential Decree No. 13 of 1997 perfected by Presidential Decree No. 166 of 2000 concerning Position, Duties, Functions, Authority, Organizational Structure and Work Procedures of Non-Departmental Government Institutions as amended several times, and the most recent by Presidential Decree No. 4 of 2018, concerning the National Standardization Agency.\n\nIn order to enhance the development of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI), the government established Government Regulation No. 102 of 2000 concerning National Standardization. On September 14, 2014, Law No. 20 of 2014 concerning Standardization and Conformity Assessment was stipulated. With the existence of this Law, the government will further strengthen the existence and role of BSN in the development process in Indonesia both in the context of physical development, efficient management of natural resources, and the development of highly competitive Indonesian people.\nWelcoming the era of globalization which demands high competitiveness, as well as the implementation of Law No. 20 of 2014, the BSN successfully reorganized itself to include a new structure namely the Deputy for the National Standard Measuring Unit (SNSU) in 2018. With the Deputy, BSN was more able to optimally implement the quality infrastructure (Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Metrology) in order to actualize a system that allows products to meet the quality and requirements of Safety, Security, Health, and Environmental Sustainability (K3L); life can be more comfortable, safe and orderly; the dignity of the nation will be lifted because Indonesia can compete more internationally. \n\n=='''Organization'''==\nThe National Standardization Agency Organization consists of the Chairman, Main Secretariat, Deputy for Standards Development, Deputy for Application of Standards and Conformity Assessment, Deputy for Accreditation, Deputy for National Standards for Measuring Units, Inspectorates, Research and Development Center for Human Resources, and Data and Systems Center Information.\n\n==='''Chairman of BSN'''=== \nThe Chairman of BSN is under and directly responsible to the President of the Republic of Indonesia with the task of: \n#Leading the BSN in accordance with the legislation in force; \n#Preparing national policies and general policies in accordance with the duties of BSN; \n#Establishing technical policies for the tasks implementation of BSN as its responsibility; \n#Fostering and carrying out cooperation with other agencies and organizations.\n\n===='''Main Secretariat'''==== \nThe Main Secretariat has the task of carrying out coordination of the implementation of tasks, coaching, and providing administrative support to all organizational units within the BSN.

During the qualifying rounds of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], Passarella contributed to the goal which ensured Argentina's qualification in the final minutes of their match against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] by allowing teammate [[Ricardo Gareca]] to score.\n\nA bout of [[enterocolitis]] meant that he missed the 1986 World Cup in [[Mexico]]. He was replaced in the first team by defender [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]]. Passarella had a fractious relationship with captain [[Diego Maradona]] and coach [[Carlos Bilardo]] during the tournament; he later claimed Bilardo and Maradona made sure that he was sidelined.<ref name=\"Chiesa\" /> Even so, by being a part of the squad, he became the only player to feature in both Argentina's World Cup-winning teams.\n\nPrior to his departure from the 1986 squad, it was revealed by Maradona that Passarella, while playing for Fiorentina, would go to Monaco to carry on an affair with the wife of another player, then boast about it in the changing rooms.<ref>El Diego, autobiography by Diego Maradona, pgs. 120-21</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter his playing days were over, he became the coach of River Plate, where he won several national titles.\n\nAppointed as coach of the Argentine national team to replace [[Alfio Basile]], Passarella was coach during the qualification games for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and during the competition itself, which was held in France. Passarella held to close friend [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]] as assistant coach. Passarella had banned long hair, earrings and homosexuals in his squad, leading to disputes with several players.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world_cup_98/teams/argentina/players/85306.stm | title = Daniel Passarella \u2013 Argentinian manager| work=BBC News | date=2 May 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=465877|title=De vuelta en casa|work=ESPNDeportes}}</ref> [[Fernando Redondo]] and [[Claudio Caniggia]] eventually refused to play for Passarella and were excluded from the squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football:+RED+ALERT;+Two-year+agony+over+as+Milan+ace+roars+back.-a096371653|title=Football: RED ALERT; Two-year agony over as Milan ace roars back.|work=thefreelibrary.com}}</ref> Argentina's performances never reached the expected heights, and the team was eliminated in the quarter-finals after a last minute 2\u20131 defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. After the elimination, Passarella left the post and was replaced by [[Marcelo Bielsa]].\n\nPassarella then became coach of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], but he left the post during the qualifying games for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], after having problems summoning players from Uruguayan sides.\n\nAfter that episode, Passarella had a brief and unsuccessful period as coach of [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in Italy in 2001, where he was sacked after five consecutives losing matches.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 18 December 2001|title= Il Parma cambia ancora esonerato Passarella|trans-title= Parma changes again Passarella sacked|url= http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio/passare/passare/passare.html|language= italian|work= |location= |access-date= 2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, he won the Mexican football league title with the team [[C.F. Monterrey]]. In March 2004, he was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]]. He was then hired as coach of [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in Brazil, but was fired after a few months after a spell of bad results.\n\nOn 9 January 2006, he was appointed River Plate coach again after 12 years to occupy the vacancy left by [[Reinaldo Merlo]]'s sudden departure. On 15 November 2007, he resigned as coach after River was beaten by penalties by [[Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed]] in the semi-finals of the [[2007 Copa Sudamericana]].\n\nIn the summer of 2018, after publicly expressing interest in returning he was widely seen as the frontrunner to become the new manager of [[CF Monterrey]] for a second stint after the departure of [[Antonio Mohamed]] but the club ultimately decided to appoint [[Diego Alonso]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/liga-mx/si-voy-a-rayados-es-para-ser-campeon-passarella|title=Si voy a Rayados es para ser campe\u00f3n: Passarella|website=www.mediotiempo.com|access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|[[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]||[[1974 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1974]]||rowspan=\"8\"|[[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]]||22||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||22||5\n|-\n|[[1975 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1975]]||29||9||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||29||9\n|-\n|[[1976 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1976]]||35||24||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||35||24\n|-\n|[[1977 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1977]]||40||13||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||40||13\n|-\n|[[1978 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1978]]||19||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||19||4\n|-\n|[[1979 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1979]]||38||9||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||38||9\n|-\n|[[1980 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1980]]||41||12||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||0||41||12\n|-\n|[[1981 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1981]]||42||14||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||42||14\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!266||90||0||0|| ||4||||94\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]||[[1982\u201383 Serie A|1982\u201383]]||rowspan=\"4\"|[[Serie A]]||27||3||5||0||2||0||34||3\n|-\n|[[1983\u201384 Serie A|1983\u201384]]||27||7||7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||34||8\n|-\n|[[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385]]||26||5||6||3||3||1||35||9\n|-\n|[[1985\u201386 Serie A|1985\u201386]]||29||11||7||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||36||15\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!109||26||25||8||5||1||139||35\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[F.C.

He started his career at [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Sarmiento|Sarmiento]] of [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Junin]], Buenos Aires province. From there he joined [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], where he became one of the best Argentinian defenders of his period, and started to be chosen in the Argentinian national team.\n\nAfter his good performances in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|world cup]], in 1982 he joined [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] of Italy, where he scored the goal record for a defender in one season (11 in 1986) in the Italian [[Serie A]]; his record remained until 2001, when he was beaten by [[Marco Materazzi]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Bagnati|first= Giuseppe|date= 27 October 2009|title= I difensori e il vizio del gol Facchetti il top, poi Matrix|trans-title= Goals and defenders: Facchetti the best one, Materazzi just behind him|url= http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/26-10-2009/i-difensori-vizio-gol--601754131334.shtml|language= italian|work= |location= |access-date= 2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, he joined [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]], where he ended his Italian playing career in 1988. After his successful spell in the [[Serie A]], he returned to River Plate, where he played until his retirement.\n\nHe was called ''\"El Gran Capit\u00e1n\"'' (the Great Captain, nickname of Argentine independence hero [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]),''\"El Kaiser\"'' (an allusion to [[Franz Beckenbauer]]) or ''\"El Caudillo\"'' (the Chief)<ref>{{cite web |last=Ferrara |first=Benedetto|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/10/05/ecco-el-caudillo-uomo-delle-sfide.html |title= Ecco El Caudillo l' uomo delle sfide |trans-title=Tha Caudillo the man of challenges |date=5 October 2000 |website= Repubblica.it|publisher= |access-date= 2 August 2017|quote=}}</ref> because of his leadership ability, his passion, and his organisational prowess on the field. He was a defender who often joined the attack, and helped generate and finish offensive plays. He was the top scoring defender, with 134 goals in 451 matches, a record since broken by Dutch defender [[Ronald Koeman]].<ref name=\"iffhd\"/>\n\nHis aerial game was effective both defensively and in attack. He scored frequent headers in spite of his average height (1.73 m). He was an excellent free kick and penalty shooter. He was also noted for using his elbows against rivals whilst managing to avoid the referee's gaze. Passarella and Chilean [[El\u00edas Figueroa]] are considered the best defenders in the history of South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tn.com.ar/deportes/passarella-el-segundo-mejor-defensor-de-la-historia_028908|title=Passarella, el segundo mejor defensor de la historia|work=tn.com.ar}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nOne of the pillars of the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]], he eventually captained the side during the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] held in Argentina. He was the first Argentine player to hold the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], as it was handed to him first when Argentina won the final. During the qualifying rounds of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], Passarella contributed to the goal which ensured Argentina's qualification in the final minutes of their match against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] by allowing teammate [[Ricardo Gareca]] to score.\n\nA bout of [[enterocolitis]] meant that he missed the 1986 World Cup in [[Mexico]]. He was replaced in the first team by defender [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]]. Passarella had a fractious relationship with captain [[Diego Maradona]] and coach [[Carlos Bilardo]] during the tournament; he later claimed Bilardo and Maradona made sure that he was sidelined.<ref name=\"Chiesa\" /> Even so, by being a part of the squad, he became the only player to feature in both Argentina's World Cup-winning teams.\n\nPrior to his departure from the 1986 squad, it was revealed by Maradona that Passarella, while playing for Fiorentina, would go to Monaco to carry on an affair with the wife of another player, then boast about it in the changing rooms.<ref>El Diego, autobiography by Diego Maradona, pgs. 120-21</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter his playing days were over, he became the coach of River Plate, where he won several national titles.\n\nAppointed as coach of the Argentine national team to replace [[Alfio Basile]], Passarella was coach during the qualification games for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and during the competition itself, which was held in France. Passarella held to close friend [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]] as assistant coach.

After the elimination, Passarella left the post and was replaced by [[Marcelo Bielsa]].\n\nPassarella then became coach of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], but he left the post during the qualifying games for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], after having problems summoning players from Uruguayan sides.\n\nAfter that episode, Passarella had a brief and unsuccessful period as coach of [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in Italy in 2001, where he was sacked after five consecutives losing matches.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 18 December 2001|title= Il Parma cambia ancora esonerato Passarella|trans-title= Parma changes again Passarella sacked|url= http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio/passare/passare/passare.html|language= italian|work= |location= |access-date= 2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, he won the Mexican football league title with the team [[C.F.

He was then hired as coach of [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in Brazil, but was fired after a few months after a spell of bad results.\n\nOn 9 January 2006, he was appointed River Plate coach again after 12 years to occupy the vacancy left by [[Reinaldo Merlo]]'s sudden departure. On 15 November 2007, he resigned as coach after River was beaten by penalties by [[Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed]] in the semi-finals of the [[2007 Copa Sudamericana]].\n\nIn the summer of 2018, after publicly expressing interest in returning he was widely seen as the frontrunner to become the new manager of [[CF Monterrey]] for a second stint after the departure of [[Antonio Mohamed]] but the club ultimately decided to appoint [[Diego Alonso]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/liga-mx/si-voy-a-rayados-es-para-ser-campeon-passarella|title=Si voy a Rayados es para ser campe\u00f3n: Passarella|website=www.mediotiempo.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|[[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]||[[1974 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1974]]||rowspan=\"8\"|[[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]]||22||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||22||5\n|-\n|[[1975 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1975]]||29||9||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||29||9\n|-\n|[[1976 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1976]]||35||24||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||35||24\n|-\n|[[1977 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1977]]||40||13||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||40||13\n|-\n|[[1978 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1978]]||19||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||19||4\n|-\n|[[1979 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1979]]||38||9||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||38||9\n|-\n|[[1980 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1980]]||41||12||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||0||41||12\n|-\n|[[1981 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1981]]||42||14||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013|| ||1||42||14\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!266||90||0||0|| ||4||||94\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]||[[1982\u201383 Serie A|1982\u201383]]||rowspan=\"4\"|[[Serie A]]||27||3||5||0||2||0||34||3\n|-\n|[[1983\u201384 Serie A|1983\u201384]]||27||7||7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||34||8\n|-\n|[[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385]]||26||5||6||3||3||1||35||9\n|-\n|[[1985\u201386 Serie A|1985\u201386]]||29||11||7||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||36||15\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!109||26||25||8||5||1||139||35\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[F.C.

It occurs in two steps:\n\n#Formation of the \"[[Grignard reagent]]\", which is an organomagnesium compound made by the reaction an organohalide, R-X (R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]]; and X is a [[halide]], usually [[bromide]] or [[iodide]]) with [[magnesium]] metal. The Grignard reagent is usually described with the general chemical formula R-Mg-X, although its structure is more complex. \n#Addition of the [[carbonyl]], in which a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]] is added to the solution containing the Grignard reagent. The carbon atom that is bonded to Mg transfers to the carbonyl carbon atom, and the oxygen of the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the magnesium to give an [[alkoxide]]. The process is an example of a [[nucleophilic addition]] to a carbonyl.  After the addition, the reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid to give an alcohol, and the magnesium salts are subsequently discarded.\n\n== Military service ==\nGrignard was drafted into the French military as part of obligatory military service in 1892.

It occurs in two steps:\n\n#Formation of the \"[[Grignard reagent]]\", which is an organomagnesium compound made by the reaction an organohalide, R-X (R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]]; and X is a [[halide]], usually [[bromide]] or [[iodide]]) with [[magnesium]] metal. The Grignard reagent is usually described with the general chemical formula R-Mg-X, although its structure is more complex. \n#Addition of the [[carbonyl]], in which a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]] is added to the solution containing the Grignard reagent. The carbon atom that is bonded to Mg transfers to the carbonyl carbon atom, and the oxygen of the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the magnesium to give an [[alkoxide]]. The process is an example of a [[nucleophilic addition]] to a carbonyl.  After the addition, the reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid to give an alcohol, and the magnesium salts are subsequently discarded.\n\n== Military Service ==\nGrignard was drafted into the French military as part of obligatory military service in 1892.

This meeting can be seen as of central significance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. For Bishop Udo I, it provided both motivation and opportunity to arrange for a delegation of monks from the [[Walkenried]] Cistercian monastery to settle in a location in the vicinity of the bishop's town of Naumburg in 1137/1138.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenf\u00e4lschungen und die fr\u00fche Geschichte bis 1236.|date=2003|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag|language=German|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger}}</ref>\n[[File:Monastery_Pforta.jpg|thumb|Cloister]]\nThe monastery complex itself comprises the religious, as well as residential and functional buildings: the [[Minster (church)|\"minster\" (church)]], the cloister and the abbot's chapel as well as numerous functional buildings from the monastery time and the mill stream Kleine Saale which flows through the monastery property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Schulpforte.

This elaborately designed facade with its sculptural decoration symbolically expressed the meaning of the Latinised monastery name of ''Porta'', meaning ''Porta Coeli'' \u2013 i.e. \"Gate of heaven\" \u2013 through its architecture.

It is situated above the weir in K\u00f6sen and was first referred to in a papal deed of confirmation from 1138. The one-storey building that has survived is dated to the third quarter of the 12th century. The grange was run by bearded lay brothers (''conversi''), including their own [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], workshops and efficient water supply systems in order to enhance the economic independence of the Cistercians.\n\nThe Cistercians managed to enlist parts of the [[peasant]] population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage.

It was established in the 1130s and prospered in the Middle Ages. In the course of the [[Reformation]] the monastery was disbanded in 1540. Today the buildings are used by the school ''[[Pforta|Landesschule Pforta]]''. The site is located on the tourist route [[Romanesque Road]] and has been nominated by Germany for inclusion in the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Sites]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Interlanguage link multi|Udo I of Naumburg|de|3=Udo I. von Th\u00fcringen|lt=Bishop Udo I of Naumburg}} who belonged to the House of the [[Ludowinger]]s, met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for the first time at the Imperial Diet in Li\u00e8ge in March 1131. This meeting can be seen as of central significance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. For Bishop Udo I, it provided both motivation and opportunity to arrange for a delegation of monks from the [[Walkenried]] Cistercian monastery to settle in a location in the vicinity of the bishop's town of Naumburg in 1137/1138.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenf\u00e4lschungen und die fr\u00fche Geschichte bis 1236.|date=2003|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag|language=German|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger}}</ref>\n[[File:Monastery_Pforta.jpg|thumb|Cloister]]\nThe monastery complex itself comprises the religious, as well as residential and functional buildings: the [[Minster (church)|\"minster\" (church)]], the cloister and the abbot's chapel as well as numerous functional buildings from the monastery time and the mill stream Kleine Saale which flows through the monastery property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Schulpforte.

It is reminiscent of a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] triumphal arch portal. This elaborately designed facade with its sculptural decoration symbolically expressed the meaning of the Latinised monastery name of ''Porta'', meaning ''Porta Coeli'' \u2013 i.e. \"Gate of heaven\" \u2013 through its architecture. It has been described as the \u2033most brilliant example of a towerless fa\u00e7ade in Germany\u2033.<ref>{{cite book|title=Die Westfassade''In:''Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta.

It is situated above the weir in K\u00f6sen and was first referred to in a papal deed of confirmation from 1138. The one-storey building that has survived is dated to the third quarter of the 12th century. The grange was run by bearded lay brothers (''conversi''), including their own [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], workshops and efficient water supply systems in order to enhance the economic independence of the Cistercians.\n\nThe Cistercians managed to enlist parts of the [[peasant]] population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage.
