A legal challenge to this stance was taken up by four people who had been investigated and dismissed for being gay&nbsp;\u2014 a female nurse and male administrator dismissed from the [[Royal Air Force]], and a [[Lieutenant Commander]] and [[naval rating]], both males, dismissed from the [[Royal Navy]]. Their legal challenge was supported by the pressure groups [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]. After losing the case at the [[EWCA Civ|Court of Appeal]] in London, they appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. In September 1999, this court ruled that investigations by military authorities into a service person's sexuality breaches their right to privacy ([[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]). In light of the ruling (which as an ECHR ruling applies to the militaries of all member states of the [[European Union|EU]] and of the [[Council of Europe]]), the MOD subsequently lifted the ban, and began allowing gay people into the services from 2000 onwards. According to a national opinion poll published a week before the ruling, the ban had been opposed by 68% of Britons.<ref name=\"bbc\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/620178.stm UK Gays win military legal battle] BBC News, 27 September 1999</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/458752.stm|title=Head to head: Gays in the military|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-09-27|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Army career==\nHaving had a lifelong ambition to serve in the British Army, Wharton began his career aged sixteen, following three years  with the [[Army Cadet Force|Army Cadets]].

A legal challenge to this stance was taken up by four people who had been investigated and dismissed for being gay&nbsp;\u2014 a female nurse and male administrator dismissed from the [[Royal Air Force]], and a [[Lieutenant Commander]] and [[naval rating]], both males, dismissed from the [[Royal Navy]]. Their legal challenge was supported by the pressure groups [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]. After losing the case at the [[EWCA Civ|Court of Appeal]] in London, they appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. In September 1999, this court ruled that investigations by military authorities into a service person's sexuality breaches their right to privacy ([[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]). In light of the ruling (which as an ECHR ruling applies to the militaries of all member states of the [[European Union|EU]] and of the [[Council of Europe]]), the MOD subsequently lifted the ban, and began allowing gay people into the services from 2000 onwards. According to a national opinion poll published a week before the ruling, the ban had been opposed by 68% of Britons.<ref name=\"bbc\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/620178.stm UK Gays win military legal battle] BBC News, 27 September 1999</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/458752.stm|title=Head to head: Gays in the military|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-09-27|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Army career==\nHaving had a lifelong ambition to serve in the British Army, Wharton began his career aged sixteen, following three years  with the [[Army Cadet Force|Army Cadets]].
