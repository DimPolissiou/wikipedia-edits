He played defensive end for the [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State Beavers]].  In his junior season, he had 42 tackles and a team-high 6.5 sacks.  McDaniels earned 2nd team All-Pac-10 honors his senior year after finishing the season with 46 tackles and 4.5 sacks.\n\n==Professional career==\nFollowing his collegiate career, McDaniels worked for [[Procter & Gamble]] as a Health and Beauty Care representative in the [[Portland, Oregon]] area before pursuing a professional football career in the [[World League of American Football]] with the [[1991 Birmingham Fire season|Birmingham Fire]].  In 1991, McDaniels signed his first contract in the National Football League with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. After having hip surgery, he spent his recovery time coaching football defensive lineman at Sunset High School in [[Beaverton, Oregon]]. Pellom spent his evenings after practice working on his own reconditioning and strength building. He was considered one of the best coaches to have worked at Sunset High according to his students. In 1992, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] asked McDaniels to join the team\u2019s practice roster, and from 1993 to 1998, he was a part of the heralded defense that countered [[NFL]] offenses throughout the '90s.  \n\nWhile a member of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] Football organization, McDaniels became a voice for Kansas City\u2019s children and contributed the resources needed to begin the Arts for Smarts foundation.  Programs like \"Pellom and I Like Art\", Wee Art, the \"Fish Out Water\" Writing program, and Smart Starts were designed to help children and young adults recognize and realize the possibilities for their futures.  After spending two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, McDaniels retired from the NFL and began his pursuit of a graduate degree at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia where he received both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. in American Studies.  He was an assistant professor in history at the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]].

He played defensive end for the [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State Beavers]].  In his junior season, he had 42 tackles and a team-high 6.5 sacks.  McDaniels earned 2nd team All-Pac-10 honors his senior year after finishing the season with 46 tackles and 4.5 sacks.\n\n==Professional career==\nFollowing his collegiate career, McDaniels worked for [[Procter & Gamble]] as a Health and Beauty Care representative in the [[Portland, Oregon]] area before pursuing a professional football career in the [[World League of American Football]] with the [[1991 Birmingham Fire season|Birmingham Fire]].  In 1991, McDaniels signed his first contract in the National Football League with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. After having hip surgery, he spent his recovery time coaching football defensive lineman at [[Sunset High School]] in Beaverton, Oregon. Pellom spent his evenings after practice working on his own reconditioning and strength building. He was considered one of the best coaches to have worked at Sunset High according to his students. In 1992, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] asked McDaniels to join the team\u2019s practice roster, and from 1993 to 1998, he was a part of the heralded defense that countered [[NFL]] offenses throughout the '90s.  \n\nWhile a member of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] Football organization, McDaniels became a voice for Kansas City\u2019s children and contributed the resources needed to begin the Arts for Smarts foundation.  Programs like \"Pellom and I Like Art\", Wee Art, the \"Fish Out Water\" Writing program, and Smart Starts were designed to help children and young adults recognize and realize the possibilities for their futures.  After spending two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, McDaniels retired from the NFL and began his pursuit of a graduate degree at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia where he received both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. in American Studies.  He was an assistant professor in history at the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]].

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water that [[Canada Post]] objected and did not want to deliver them all.  According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the [[Rideau Valley Conservation Authority]] and the clean-up of both the Rideau River and the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith his 1967 S''ave The Centennial Flame'' Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from listeners, the iconic [[Centennial Flame]] continues to shine on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIn 1975, after the school shooting that occurred at the [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X High School]] in Ottawa, Lowell Green and thousands of his supporters joined his ''Fire Arms Safety Association''.

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water that [[Canada Post]] objected and did not want to deliver them all.  According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the [[Rideau Valley Conservation Authority]] and the clean-up of both the Rideau River and the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSince 1967, and with his S''ave The Centennial Flame'' Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from listeners, the [[Centennial Flame]] continues to shine on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIn 1975, after the school shooting that occurred at the [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X High School]] in Ottawa, Lowell Green and thousands of his supporters joined his ''Fire Arms Safety Association''.

Born in [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], he studied and practised law in [[Ottawa]] before he moved with his family to the [[North-West Territories]] in 1895. There, he began his political career, winning in his third attempt a seat in the [[North-West Legislative Assembly]]. In keeping with the territorial custom, Rutherford ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] but generally supported the territorial administration of Premier [[Frederick W.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G. Haultain]]. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].\n\nIn 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor [[George Bulyea]] asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As premier, Rutherford's first task was to win a workable majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], which he did in the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 provincial election]]. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government, and his government established everything from [[speed limit]]s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected [[Edmonton]] over rival [[Calgary]] as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the [[University of Alberta]], a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], just across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe government was faced with labour unrest in the [[coal mining]] industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network ([[Alberta Government Telephones]]) at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways.\n\nIt was in pursuit of the last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, [[William Henry Cushing]]'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign. He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but he was defeated in the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]] by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Herbert Crawford]].\n\nAfter leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became [[List of Chancellors of the University of Alberta|chancellor of the University of Alberta]], whose earlier founding had been a personal project, and stayed in that position until he died of a heart attack.\n\nA University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and [[Jasper National Park]]'s [[Mount Rutherford]] are named in his honour.

Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the [[District of Alberta]] were president of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted [[freemasonry|Masons]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\">Babcock 10</ref> He also became secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an [[unincorporated community]]. When incorporation came in 1899, as the Town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer after he had acted as returning officer in its first election.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\nThroughout that period, he practised law, from 1899 with [[Frederick C. Jamieson]], who later was elected as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].<ref name=\"Babcock 15\">Babcock 15</ref> He employed single women as secretaries in an era that.erical workers were predominantly male, and he defended a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|First Nations person]] accused of murder when most lawyers refused such cases.<ref name=\"Babcock 15\"/> As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in [[credit (finance)|moneylending]].<ref name=\"Babcock 21\">Babcock 21</ref> Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful [[real estate]] investor, and he also owned an interest in [[gold mining]] equipment situated on the [[North Saskatchewan River]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\">Babcock 16</ref>\n\n===Early political career===\nIn 1896, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], who had represented [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing [[by-election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature [[petition]] urging his candidacy was presented to him.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His only opponent was a former [[mayor of Edmonton]], [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]], who, like Rutherford, ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and (in what would become a theme of his political career) increased educational funding.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Rutherford family.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Rutherford family in 1898]]During the [[1898 Northwest Territories general election|1898 territorial election]], Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a [[redistribution (election)|redrawing]] of the territory's electoral boundaries. He believed that the current Edmonton [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] was [[gerrymander]]ed in McCauley's favour.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\">Babcock 11</ref> He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> He pledged \"independent support\" for the nonpartisan administration of Premier [[Frederick Haultain]],<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> and he supported that administration's call for the creation of a [[Province of Buffalo|single province]] from the territories following the 1901 [[census]].<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Despite this, McCauley won again but by a reduced margin.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/>\n\nRutherford was at last successful in the [[1902 Northwest Territories general election|1902 election]], when he ran in the newly-created riding of [[Strathcona (N.W.T. electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 19\">Babcock 19</ref> His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, but he now supported a two-province integration of the [[Northwest Territories]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute, local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival [[John R. Boyle]], and won an easy victory.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/>\n\nRutherford served in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a province in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> He was considered a possible member of Haultain's [[Executive Council (Canada)|executive council]], likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to [[George Bulyea]].<ref>Babcock 19\u201320</ref> He joined many of his fellow [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.<ref name=\"Roome 7\">Roome 7</ref>\n\nThough Rutherford supported Haultain's vision of nonpartisan territorial administration, federally he was an avowed [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]. In 1900, he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in [[Alberta (Provisional District)|Alberta]] for the [[1900 Canadian federal election|1900 federal election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt.<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> When the new federal constituency of [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]] was formed in advance of the [[1904 Canadian federal election|1904 election]],<ref>Not to be confused with the territorial constituency of the same name, which Rutherford was then representing, or the provincial district, which he would later represent</ref> Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination but demurred.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\">Babcock 20</ref> [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]] was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\"/>\n\n===Selection as premier===\n[[File:1905albertacabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Rutherford and his cabinet]]\nIn February 1905, the federal government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] introduced legislation to create two new provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]) from the Northwest Territories.<ref name=\"Babcock 22\">Babcock 22</ref> Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same nonpartisan basis as the Territories had been, the Liberal Laurier was expected to recommend a Liberal to serve as [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the Lieutenant-Governor was expected to call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government.<ref name=\"Thomas 15\">Thomas 15</ref> Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but he had just been named federal Minister of the Interior and was not interested in leaving Ottawa.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\">Thomas 16</ref> Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and found the latter prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\"/> Both men supported Rutherford, but neither was enthusiastic about doing so.<ref name=\"Babcock 23\">Babcock 23</ref> In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Alberta Liberals]] selected Rutherford as their first leader.<ref>Thomas 17\u201318</ref>\n\nA final barrier was removed a few days later, when Haultain, who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a [[coalition government]], announced that he would stay in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives.<ref name=\"Thomas 18\">Thomas 18</ref> On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 19\">Thomas 19</ref>\n\nAfter accepting the position of premier, Rutherford selected a geographically-diverse cabinet on September 6: [[Edmonton]]'s [[Charles Wilson Cross]] as Attorney-General, [[Calgary]]'s [[William Henry Cushing]] as Minister of Public Works, [[Medicine Hat]]'s [[William Finlay]] as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and [[Lethbridge]]'s [[Leverett DeVeber|George DeVeber]] as Minister without Portfolio.<ref>Thomas 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.<ref name=\"Thomas 21\">Thomas 21</ref>\n\n==Premier==\n\n===1905 election===\n{{main|1905 Alberta general election}}\nRutherford was now premier but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\">Babcock 27</ref> Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\"/> The [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], the young province's only other political party, had already selected [[R.

The federal legislation creating the province had fixed [[Edmonton]] as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"Thomas 13\">Thomas 13</ref> Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign,<ref name=\"Thomas 24\"/> but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members, including Rutherford, to eight.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\">Thomas 38</ref>\n\nA personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/> Though the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' opined that it would be unfair \"that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it,\" Rutherford proceeded quickly.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/>  He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high-quality nonsectarian system of postsecondary education.<ref name=\"Thomas 40\">Thomas 40</ref> A bill establishing the university was passed by the legislature but left the government to decide the location.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> Calgary felt that having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there,<ref name=\"Thomas 39\">Thomas 39</ref> and it was not pleased when, a year late the government announced the founding of the [[University of Alberta]] in Rutherford's hometown, Strathcona.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\">Thomas 50</ref>\n\n[[File:Premier Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford as Premier]]While the regionally-charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906, it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].<ref name=\"Thomas 41\">Thomas 41</ref> It also established a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection.<ref>Thomas 40\u201341</ref> Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system,<ref name=\"Thomas 36\">Thomas 36</ref> with [[Arthur Lewis Sifton]] as the province's first Chief Justice.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\">Thomas 48</ref>\n\nThough the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a [[normal school]] was set up in Calgary to train teachers.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province that were occupied primarily by Central and Eastern European immigrants.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\">Thomas 42</ref> They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as [[Mennonites]]. While the continued existence of [[Roman Catholic]] separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\"/> Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province but was criticized for commissioning the texts from a [[Toronto]] publisher, which printed them in [[New York (state)|New York]], rather than locally.<ref name=\"Babcock 35\">Babcock 35</ref>\n\n===Labour unrest===\nThe winter of 1906\u201307 was the coldest in Alberta history and was exacerbated by a shortage of coal.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\">Thomas 46</ref> One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\"/> At the beginning of April 1907, the Canada West Coal and Coke Company [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] the miners from its mine near [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]].<ref name=\"Thomas 47\">Thomas 47</ref> The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the [[Crow's Nest Pass]], where miners were refusing to sign a new contract.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> The problem spread until by April 22, all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> Miners' demands included increased wages,<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that since many miners did not report to work the day after payday, it desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Sifton2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Sifton]] chaired the commission inquiring into conditions in Alberta's coal mines and later succeeded Rutherford as Premier.]]Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It consisted of Chief Justice [[Arthur Sifton]], mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It began taking evidence in July.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay. Coal supply promptly increased, as did its price.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended for Albertans to keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of [[company store]]s (a sore point among the miners), and the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.<ref>Thomas 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe committee also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an [[eight-hour day]] anyway.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\">Thomas 49</ref> As well, Rutherford's government also passed [[workers' compensation]] legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer.<ref>Thomas 56\u201357</ref> Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers, for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while they were working on buildings more than {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, amd for exempting casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to {{convert|30|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/> In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were made exempt from the bill entirely.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/>\n\nRutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> In 1908, [[Labour parties and candidates in Canada|Labour]] candidate [[Donald McNabb]] was elected in a [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finkel |first=Alvin |date=Fall 1985 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Party in Alberta, 1917\u201342 |journal=Labour/Le Travail |volume=16 |page=63 |url=http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184337/http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Public works===\nRutherford's Liberals self-identified as the party of free enterprise, in contrast to the Conservatives, who supported public ownership<ref name=\"Thomas 2.3\">Thomas 23</ref> Still the Liberals made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which being the creation of [[Alberta Government Telephones]].<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\">Thomas 52</ref> Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> The largest private company was the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company]], which held a [[monopoly]] over service in Calgary.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely-populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907.<ref name=\"Thomas 51\">Thomas 51</ref> The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and it also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\">Thomas 53</ref>\n\nAlberta's public telephone system was financed by debt, which was unusual for a government like Rutherford's, which.was generally committed to the principle of \"[[PAYGO|pay as you go]]\".<ref>Thomas 52\u201353</ref> Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project should not.be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating [[government budget deficit|deficit]]s, acceptable.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\"/> Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be financially astute. By focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such.problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however. In the short term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]].<ref name=\"Thomas 64\">Thomas 64</ref> The Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly-expanded legislature.<ref name=\"Thomas 69\">Thomas 69</ref>\n\nOf equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic and manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\">Thomas 59</ref> Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers if sufficient charters were issued to competing companies.<ref>Thomas 43\u201344</ref> The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited.<ref>Thomas 58\u201359</ref>\n\nIn the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered [[loan guarantees]] to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\">Thomas 62</ref> Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than have railway expansion follow population growth, which would be the case without government intervention.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\"/> The Conservatives argued that the strategy did not go far enough, and they called for direct government ownership.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\"/>\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford's official portrait.]]\nWhile most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, but after the 1909 election, Rutherford named himself as the province's first Minister of Railways.<ref>Babcock 57</ref>\n\n===Railway scandal===\n{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}\n[[File:John R.

He was replaced by [[Arthur Sifton]], hitherto the province's chief judge.<ref>Thomas 87\u201390</ref>\n\nIn November, the royal commission issued its report<ref name=\"Thomas 97\">Thomas 97</ref> that found that the evidence did not show a [[conflict of interest]] on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former premier.<ref>Thomas 97\u2013104</ref> A minority report was much kinder by avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.<ref>Thomas 104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Later political career===\nBefore the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford to run against him in [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly. Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross and viewed him as a rival for dominance of the Liberal Party in Alberta,<ref name=\"Thomas 132\">Thomas 132</ref> and his ''Edmonton Bulletin'' had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, but Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Before the meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\">Babcock 69\u201370</ref> Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that to be caused by the Conservatives' nomination of [[William Antrobus Griesbach]], dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude them from opposing him.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund and had balked.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\"/> Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid [[vote splitting|splitting the vote]] on [[reciprocity (Canadian politics)|reciprocity]], which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Whatever the reason for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/>\n\nAfter resigning as premier, Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\">Babcock 69</ref> He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\">Babcock 67</ref> but the faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader.<ref name=\"Thomas 108\">Thomas 108</ref> Rutherford opposed the Sifton government's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\"/> and in 1913, he was one of only two Liberals to support a non-confidence motion against the government<ref name=\"Babcock 70\">Babcock 70\"</ref> (Cross had by now joined the Sifton cabinet, which placated most members of the Cross-Rutherford faction.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/>\n\nIn the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]], Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in [[Edmonton South (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton South]] (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/edmonton/ |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |title=Edmonton |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007230006/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002525 |archivedate=2008-10-07 }}</ref> despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\">Babcock 71</ref> At the nomination meeting, he stated that he was \"not running as a Sifton candidate\" and was \"a good independent candidate&nbsp;... and a good Liberal too\".<ref name=\"Babcock 72\">Babcock 72</ref> Despite his opposition to the government, Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated [[Herbert Crawford]] to run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\"/> After a vigorous campaign, Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes.<ref name=\"Babcock 72\"/> Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier for Rutherford to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]. He was unsuccessful, but Rutherford was made [[King's Counsel]] shortly after his electoral defeat.<ref name=\"Babcock 68\">Babcock 68</ref>\n\nRutherford took a strong line against the Sifton government and was nominated as Conservative candidate for the 1917 provincial election but stood down after being named as Alberta director of the National Service (conscription).

Boyle in particular, he offered voters the slogan \"get rid of the barnacles and the [[John R. Boyle|Boyle]]s\", a homonymic reference to the parasitic growth on the side of a ship.<ref name=\"Babcock 73\"/> He may have been thrilled to see the Liberal government fall in the election but probably less so when he saw that the triumphant [[United Farmers of Alberta]] had also whittled the Conservatives down to only one seat.<ref name=\"Thomas 204\">Thomas 204</ref>\n\n===Professional career===\nOnce out of politics, Rutherford returned to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go.<ref name=\"Babcock 75\"/> Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office that he opened in 1910.

Born in [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], he studied and practised law in [[Ottawa]] before he moved with his family to the [[North-West Territories]] in 1895. There, he began his political career, winning in his third attempt a seat in the [[North-West Legislative Assembly]]. In keeping with the territorial custom, Rutherford ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] but generally supported the territorial administration of Premier [[Frederick W.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G. Haultain]]. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].\n\nIn 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor [[George Bulyea]] asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As premier, Rutherford's first task was to win a workable majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], which he did in the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 provincial election]]. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government, and his government established everything from [[speed limit]]s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected [[Edmonton]] over rival [[Calgary]] as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the [[University of Alberta]], a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], just across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe government was faced with labour unrest in the [[coal mining]] industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network ([[Alberta Government Telephones]]) at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways.\n\nIt was in pursuit of the last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, [[William Henry Cushing]]'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign. He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but he was defeated in the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]] by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Herbert Crawford]].\n\nAfter leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became [[List of Chancellors of the University of Alberta|chancellor of the University of Alberta]], whose earlier founding had been a personal project, and stayed in that position until he died of a heart attack.\n\nA University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and [[Jasper National Park]]'s [[Mount Rutherford]] are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, [[Rutherford House]], was opened as a museum in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Rutherford articling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rutherford as an articled clerk, {{circa|1883}}]]Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], on his family's dairy farm.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\">Babcock 1</ref> His parents, James (1817&ndash;1891) and Elspet<ref name=\"pc205\" /> \"Elizabeth\" (1818&ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford,<ref name=\"pc205\">Perry, Craig 2006, p. 205.</ref> had immigrated from [[Scotland]] two years previous.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> They joined the [[Baptist Church]], and his father joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and served for a time on the [[Osgoode, Ontario|Osgoode]] village council.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a [[Metcalfe, Ontario|Metcalfe]] high school.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> After graduating in 1874, he attended the [[Canadian Literary Institute]], a Baptist college in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]].<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> He graduated from there in 1876 and taught for a year in Osgoode.\n\nHe moved to [[Montreal]] to study arts and law at [[McGill University]].<ref name=\"Roome 4\">Roome 4</ref> He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the [[Ottawa]] law firm of Scott, McTavish and McCracken, where he was [[articled clerk|articled]] for four years under the tutelage of [[Richard William Scott]].<ref>Babcock 1\u20134</ref> Called to the Ontario bar in 1885, he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodkins, Kidd and Rutherford, with responsibility for its [[Kemptville, Ontario|Kemptville]] office for ten years.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\">Babcock 4</ref> He also established a moneylending business there.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\">Babcock 5</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, his social circle grew to include [[William Cameron Edwards]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Through Edwards, Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family, which included former [[Member of Parliament]] [[Thomas Birkett]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Rutherford married Birkett's niece, [[Mattie Birkett]], in December 1888.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893),<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> and Marjorie (born in 1903 but died sixteen months later).<ref>Babcock 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles and was happy to leave most childrearing responsibilities to his wife.<ref name=\"Roome 6\">Roome 6</ref>\n\n===Move west===\nIn November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian West for the first time, when he travelled to [[British Columbia]] to investigate the disappearance of his cousin.<ref name=\"Roome 5\">Roome 5</ref> The [[Rocky Mountains]] left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate, which he found \"very agreeable\".<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Upon arriving in [[Strathcona, Alberta|South Edmonton]], he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> He resolved to settle there and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children,<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> who arrived by train June 10, 1895.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/> Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\">Babcock 8</ref> In July, the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\"/> In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/>\n\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford around the time of his move West]]Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the [[District of Alberta]] were president of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted [[freemasonry|Masons]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\">Babcock 10</ref> He also became secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an [[unincorporated community]]. When incorporation came in 1899, as the Town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer after he had acted as returning officer in its first election.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\nThroughout that period, he practised law, from 1899 with [[Frederick C. Jamieson]], who later was elected as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].<ref name=\"Babcock 15\">Babcock 15</ref> He employed single women as secretaries in an era that.erical workers were predominantly male, and he defended a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|First Nations person]] accused of murder when most lawyers refused such cases.<ref name=\"Babcock 15\"/> As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in [[credit (finance)|moneylending]].<ref name=\"Babcock 21\">Babcock 21</ref> Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful [[real estate]] investor, and he also owned an interest in [[gold mining]] equipment situated on the [[North Saskatchewan River]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\">Babcock 16</ref>\n\n===Early political career===\nIn 1896, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], who had represented [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing [[by-election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature [[petition]] urging his candidacy was presented to him.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His only opponent was a former [[mayor of Edmonton]], [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]], who, like Rutherford, ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and (in what would become a theme of his political career) increased educational funding.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Rutherford family.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Rutherford family in 1898]]During the [[1898 Northwest Territories general election|1898 territorial election]], Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a [[redistribution (election)|redrawing]] of the territory's electoral boundaries. He believed that the current Edmonton [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] was [[gerrymander]]ed in McCauley's favour.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\">Babcock 11</ref> He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> He pledged \"independent support\" for the nonpartisan administration of Premier [[Frederick Haultain]],<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> and he supported that administration's call for the creation of a [[Province of Buffalo|single province]] from the territories following the 1901 [[census]].<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Despite this, McCauley won again but by a reduced margin.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/>\n\nRutherford was at last successful in the [[1902 Northwest Territories general election|1902 election]], when he ran in the newly-created riding of [[Strathcona (N.W.T. electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 19\">Babcock 19</ref> His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, but he now supported a two-province integration of the [[Northwest Territories]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute, local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival [[John R. Boyle]], and won an easy victory.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/>\n\nRutherford served in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a province in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> He was considered a possible member of Haultain's [[Executive Council (Canada)|executive council]], likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to [[George Bulyea]].<ref>Babcock 19\u201320</ref> He joined many of his fellow [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.<ref name=\"Roome 7\">Roome 7</ref>\n\nThough Rutherford supported Haultain's vision of nonpartisan territorial administration, federally he was an avowed [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]. In 1900, he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in [[Alberta (Provisional District)|Alberta]] for the [[1900 Canadian federal election|1900 federal election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt.<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> When the new federal constituency of [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]] was formed in advance of the [[1904 Canadian federal election|1904 election]],<ref>Not to be confused with the territorial constituency of the same name, which Rutherford was then representing, or the provincial district, which he would later represent</ref> Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination but demurred.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\">Babcock 20</ref> [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]] was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\"/>\n\n===Selection as premier===\n[[File:1905albertacabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Rutherford and his cabinet]]\nIn February 1905, the federal government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] introduced legislation to create two new provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]) from the Northwest Territories.<ref name=\"Babcock 22\">Babcock 22</ref> Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same nonpartisan basis as the Territories had been, the Liberal Laurier was expected to recommend a Liberal to serve as [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the Lieutenant-Governor was expected to call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government.<ref name=\"Thomas 15\">Thomas 15</ref> Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but he had just been named federal Minister of the Interior and was not interested in leaving Ottawa.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\">Thomas 16</ref> Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and found the latter prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\"/> Both men supported Rutherford, but neither was enthusiastic about doing so.<ref name=\"Babcock 23\">Babcock 23</ref> In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Alberta Liberals]] selected Rutherford as their first leader.<ref>Thomas 17\u201318</ref>\n\nA final barrier was removed a few days later, when Haultain, who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a [[coalition government]], announced that he would stay in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives.<ref name=\"Thomas 18\">Thomas 18</ref> On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 19\">Thomas 19</ref>\n\nAfter accepting the position of premier, Rutherford selected a geographically-diverse cabinet on September 6: [[Edmonton]]'s [[Charles Wilson Cross]] as Attorney-General, [[Calgary]]'s [[William Henry Cushing]] as Minister of Public Works, [[Medicine Hat]]'s [[William Finlay]] as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and [[Lethbridge]]'s [[Leverett DeVeber|George DeVeber]] as Minister without Portfolio.<ref>Thomas 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.<ref name=\"Thomas 21\">Thomas 21</ref>\n\n==Premier==\n\n===1905 election===\n{{main|1905 Alberta general election}}\nRutherford was now premier but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\">Babcock 27</ref> Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\"/> The [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], the young province's only other political party, had already selected [[R. B. Bennett]] as their leader.<ref name=\"Thomas 18\"/> Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources in the hands of the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of [[separate school]]s.<ref name=\"Thomas 24\">Thomas 24</ref> He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]].<ref name=\"Babcock 27\"/><ref name=\"Thomas 24\"/> The Liberals responded to such.criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\"/> They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was because of their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives and for which Bennett had acted as solicitor.<ref name=\"Thomas 26\">Thomas 26</ref>\n\n[[File:Young R.

When all the votes had been counted, the Liberals won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two.<ref name=\"Thomas 28\"/> Bennett himself was defeated in his [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary riding]].<ref name=\"Thomas 28\"/> When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.<ref name=\"Babcock 28\">Babcock 28</ref>\n\n===First legislature and regional tensions===\nOne of the most contentious issues facing the newly:elected government was the decision of the province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed [[Edmonton]] as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"Thomas 13\">Thomas 13</ref> Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign,<ref name=\"Thomas 24\"/> but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members, including Rutherford, to eight.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\">Thomas 38</ref>\n\nA personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/> Though the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' opined that it would be unfair \"that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it,\" Rutherford proceeded quickly.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/>  He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high-quality nonsectarian system of postsecondary education.<ref name=\"Thomas 40\">Thomas 40</ref> A bill establishing the university was passed by the legislature but left the government to decide the location.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> Calgary felt that having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there,<ref name=\"Thomas 39\">Thomas 39</ref> and it was not pleased when, a year late the government announced the founding of the [[University of Alberta]] in Rutherford's hometown, Strathcona.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\">Thomas 50</ref>\n\n[[File:Premier Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford as Premier]]While the regionally-charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906, it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].<ref name=\"Thomas 41\">Thomas 41</ref> It also established a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection.<ref>Thomas 40\u201341</ref> Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system,<ref name=\"Thomas 36\">Thomas 36</ref> with [[Arthur Lewis Sifton]] as the province's first Chief Justice.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\">Thomas 48</ref>\n\nThough the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a [[normal school]] was set up in Calgary to train teachers.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province that were occupied primarily by Central and Eastern European immigrants.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\">Thomas 42</ref> They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as [[Mennonites]]. While the continued existence of [[Roman Catholic]] separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\"/> Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province but was criticized for commissioning the texts from a [[Toronto]] publisher, which printed them in [[New York (state)|New York]], rather than locally.<ref name=\"Babcock 35\">Babcock 35</ref>\n\n===Labour unrest===\nThe winter of 1906\u201307 was the coldest in Alberta history and was exacerbated by a shortage of coal.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\">Thomas 46</ref> One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\"/> At the beginning of April 1907, the Canada West Coal and Coke Company [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] the miners from its mine near [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]].<ref name=\"Thomas 47\">Thomas 47</ref> The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the [[Crow's Nest Pass]], where miners were refusing to sign a new contract.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> The problem spread until by April 22, all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> Miners' demands included increased wages,<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that since many miners did not report to work the day after payday, it desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Sifton2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Sifton]] chaired the commission inquiring into conditions in Alberta's coal mines and later succeeded Rutherford as Premier.]]Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It consisted of Chief Justice [[Arthur Sifton]], mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It began taking evidence in July.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay. Coal supply promptly increased, as did its price.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended for Albertans to keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of [[company store]]s (a sore point among the miners), and the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.<ref>Thomas 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe committee also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an [[eight-hour day]] anyway.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\">Thomas 49</ref> As well, Rutherford's government also passed [[workers' compensation]] legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer.<ref>Thomas 56\u201357</ref> Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers, for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while they were working on buildings more than {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, amd for exempting casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to {{convert|30|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/> In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were made exempt from the bill entirely.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/>\n\nRutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> In 1908, [[Labour parties and candidates in Canada|Labour]] candidate [[Donald McNabb]] was elected in a [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finkel |first=Alvin |date=Fall 1985 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Party in Alberta, 1917\u201342 |journal=Labour/Le Travail |volume=16 |page=63 |url=http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184337/http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Public works===\nRutherford's Liberals self-identified as the party of free enterprise, in contrast to the Conservatives, who supported public ownership<ref name=\"Thomas 2.3\">Thomas 23</ref> Still the Liberals made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which being the creation of [[Alberta Government Telephones]].<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\">Thomas 52</ref> Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> The largest private company was the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company]], which held a [[monopoly]] over service in Calgary.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely-populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907.<ref name=\"Thomas 51\">Thomas 51</ref> The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and it also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\">Thomas 53</ref>\n\nAlberta's public telephone system was financed by debt, which was unusual for a government like Rutherford's, which.was generally committed to the principle of \"[[PAYGO|pay as you go]]\".<ref>Thomas 52\u201353</ref> Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project should not.be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating [[government budget deficit|deficit]]s, acceptable.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\"/> Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be financially astute. By focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such.problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however. In the short term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]].<ref name=\"Thomas 64\">Thomas 64</ref> The Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly-expanded legislature.<ref name=\"Thomas 69\">Thomas 69</ref>\n\nOf equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic and manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\">Thomas 59</ref> Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers if sufficient charters were issued to competing companies.<ref>Thomas 43\u201344</ref> The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited.<ref>Thomas 58\u201359</ref>\n\nIn the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered [[loan guarantees]] to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\">Thomas 62</ref> Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than have railway expansion follow population growth, which would be the case without government intervention.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\"/> The Conservatives argued that the strategy did not go far enough, and they called for direct government ownership.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\"/>\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford's official portrait.]]\nWhile most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, but after the 1909 election, Rutherford named himself as the province's first Minister of Railways.<ref>Babcock 57</ref>\n\n===Railway scandal===\n{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}\n[[File:John R.

He was replaced by [[Arthur Sifton]], hitherto the province's chief judge.<ref>Thomas 87\u201390</ref>\n\nIn November, the royal commission issued its report<ref name=\"Thomas 97\">Thomas 97</ref> that found that the evidence did not show a [[conflict of interest]] on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former premier.<ref>Thomas 97\u2013104</ref> A minority report was much kinder by avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.<ref>Thomas 104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Later political career===\nBefore the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford to run against him in [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly. Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross and viewed him as a rival for dominance of the Liberal Party in Alberta,<ref name=\"Thomas 132\">Thomas 132</ref> and his ''Edmonton Bulletin'' had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, but Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Before the meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\">Babcock 69\u201370</ref> Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that to be caused by the Conservatives' nomination of [[William Antrobus Griesbach]], dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude them from opposing him.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund and had balked.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\"/> Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid [[vote splitting|splitting the vote]] on [[reciprocity (Canadian politics)|reciprocity]], which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Whatever the reason for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/>\n\nAfter resigning as premier, Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\">Babcock 69</ref> He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\">Babcock 67</ref> but the faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader.<ref name=\"Thomas 108\">Thomas 108</ref> Rutherford opposed the Sifton government's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\"/> and in 1913, he was one of only two Liberals to support a non-confidence motion against the government<ref name=\"Babcock 70\">Babcock 70\"</ref> (Cross had by now joined the Sifton cabinet, which placated most members of the Cross-Rutherford faction.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/>\n\nIn the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]], Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in [[Edmonton South (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton South]] (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/edmonton/ |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |title=Edmonton |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007230006/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002525 |archivedate=2008-10-07 }}</ref> despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\">Babcock 71</ref> At the nomination meeting, he stated that he was \"not running as a Sifton candidate\" and was \"a good independent candidate&nbsp;... and a good Liberal too\".<ref name=\"Babcock 72\">Babcock 72</ref> Despite his opposition to the government, Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated [[Herbert Crawford]] to run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\"/> After a vigorous campaign, Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes.<ref name=\"Babcock 72\"/> Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier for Rutherford to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].
