Jordan's 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry at USA garrison. Raiders captured 30 of retreating enemy and destroyed tents and stores. They took 20 wagons, 50 mules, 40 horses, sugar and coffee supplies. At Glasgow they burned supplies, then went north, raiding 16 other towns before returning to Tennessee. A folk tale is also present in the area after the mysterious death of union lieutenant Cecil L.

In 1956 [[Suez Crisis#The Israeli operation Kadesh in Sinai|Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula]] in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the [[Straits of Tiran]] that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was eventually forced to withdraw, but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. A [[United Nations Emergency Force]] was deployed along the border, but there was no [[demilitarisation]] agreement.<ref name=\"Rikhye2013\">{{cite book|author=Major General Indar Jit Rikhye|title=The Sinai Blunder: Withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force Leading....|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teHWAQAAQBAJ&pg=PR8|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-27985-0|pages=8\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the months prior to June 1967, [[Origins of the Six-Day War|tensions became dangerously heightened]]. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war (a ''[[casus belli]]''). In May Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel. On 5 June, Israel launched what it claimed were a series of [[Preemptive war|preemptive]] airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. The question of which side caused the war is one of a number of [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War|controversies relating to the conflict]].\n\nThe Egyptians were caught by surprise, and nearly the entire Egyptian air force was destroyed with few Israeli losses, giving the Israelis [[air supremacy]]. Simultaneously, the Israelis launched a ground offensive into the [[Gaza Strip]] and the Sinai, which again caught the Egyptians by surprise. After some initial resistance, Nasser ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward in pursuit of the Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and [[Israeli occupation of Sinai|conquered the Sinai]].\n\nJordan had entered into a defence pact with Egypt a week before the war began; the agreement envisaged that in the event of war Jordan would not take an offensive role but would attempt to tie down Israeli forces to prevent them making territorial gains.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=183|ps=: \u201cIt is clear that King Hussein joined forces with Egypt in the knowledge that there was no possibility of overrunning Israel. Instead he sought to preserve the status quo. He believed that he could not stand aside at a time when Arab co-operation and solidarity were vital and he was convinced that any Arab confrontation with Israel would be greatly enhanced if the Arabs fought as a unified body. The plan of action devised at his meeting with Nasser in Cairo on 30 May was established on this basis. It was envisaged that Jordan would not take an offensive role but would tie down a proportion of Israel's forces and so prevent it from using its full weight against Egypt and Syria. By forcing Israel to fight a war on three fronts simultaneously King Hussein believed that the Arabs stood a chance of preventing it from making any territorial gains while allowing the Arabs a chance of gaining a political victory, which may, eventually, lead to peace. King Hussein was also convinced that even if Jordan did not participate in the war Israel would take the opportunity to seize the West Bank once it had dealt with Syria and Egypt. He decided that for this reason the wisest course of action was to bring Jordan into the total Arab effort. This would provide his army with two elements which were essential for its efficient operation \u2013 additional troops and air cover. When King Hussein met Nasser in Cairo it was agreed that these requirements would be met.\u201d}} About an hour after the Israeli air attack, the Egyptian commander of the Jordanian army was ordered by Cairo to begin attacks on Israel; in the initially confused situation, the Jordanians were told that Egypt had repelled the Israeli air strikes.\n\nEgypt and Jordan agreed to a ceasefire on 8 June, and Syria agreed on 9 June; a ceasefire was signed with Israel on 11 June. In the aftermath of the war, Israel had crippled the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian militaries, having killed over 20,000 troops while only losing fewer than 1,000 of its own. The Israeli success was the result of a well-prepared and enacted strategy, the poor leadership of the Arab states, and their poor military leadership and strategy. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel's international standing greatly improved in the following years. Its victory humiliated Egypt, Jordan and Syria, leading Nasser to resign in shame; he was later reinstated after protests in Egypt against his resignation. The speed and ease of Israel's victory would later lead to a dangerous overconfidence within the ranks of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), contributing to initial Arab successes in the subsequent 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], although ultimately Israeli forces were successful and defeated the Arab militaries. The displacement of civilian populations resulting from the war would have long-term consequences, as 300,000 [[Palestinians]] fled the West Bank and about 100,000 Syrians left the Golan Heights. Across the Arab world, Jewish minority communities fled or were expelled, with refugees going mainly to Israel or Europe.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Origins of the Six-Day War}}\n[[File:Nasser and Egyptian pilots pre-1967.gif|thumb|On 22 May 1967, President Nasser addressed his pilots at [[Bir Gifgafa Airfield]] in Sinai: \"The Jews are threatening war \u2013 we say to them [[wikt:\u0623\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627|ahlan wa-sahlan]] (welcome)!\"<ref name=\"Gluska2007p152\" />]]\n<!--\nPLEASE DO NOT ADD TEXT TO THE BACKGROUND SECTION WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING CONSENSUS AGREEMENT ON THE TALK PAGE.

The following day, at Jordan's invitation, the Iraqi army began deploying troops and armoured units in Jordan.<ref>Churchill po. 52 and 77</ref> They were later reinforced by an Egyptian contingent. On 1 June, Israel formed a [[National Unity Government]] by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched [[Operation Focus]], a large-scale, surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six-Day War.\n\n=== Military preparation ===\nBefore the war, Israeli pilots and ground crews had trained extensively in rapid refitting of aircraft returning from [[sortie]]s, enabling a single aircraft to sortie up to four times a day (as opposed to the norm in Arab air forces of one or two sorties per day). This enabled the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) to send several attack waves against Egyptian airfields on the first day of the war, overwhelming the Egyptian Air Force, and allowed it to knock out other Arab air forces on the same day. This has contributed to the Arab belief that the IAF was helped by foreign air forces (see [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War#Combat support|Controversies relating to the Six-Day War]]). Pilots were extensively schooled about their targets, and were forced to memorise every single detail, and rehearsed the operation multiple times on dummy runways in total secrecy.\n\nThe Egyptians had constructed fortified defences in the Sinai. These designs were based on the assumption that an attack would come along the few roads leading through the desert, rather than through the difficult desert terrain. The Israelis chose not to risk attacking the Egyptian defences head-on, and instead surprised them from an unexpected direction.\n\nJames Reston, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 23 May 1967, noted, \"In discipline, training, morale, equipment and general competence his [Nasser's] army and the other Arab forces, without the direct assistance of the Soviet Union, are no match for the Israelis. ... Even with 50,000 troops and the best of his generals and air force in Yemen, he has not been able to work his way in that small and primitive country, and even his effort to help the Congo rebels was a flop.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Reston, James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/24/archives/washington-nassers-reckless-maneuvers-cairo-and-moscow-the-us.html |title=Washington: Nasser's Reckless Maneuvers; Cairo and Moscow The U.S. Commitment The Staggering Economy Moscow's Role |work=The New York Times |date=24 May 1967 |page=46 |access-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706021950/https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/24/archives/washington-nassers-reckless-maneuvers-cairo-and-moscow-the-us.html |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the war, Israel believed it could win a war in 3\u20134 days.

In addition, there were uprisings by discontented elements of the Syrian population, less than satisfactory encounters with Israeli forces, and lukewarm Soviet support...

They also had 12 battalions of artillery, six batteries of 81&nbsp;mm and 120&nbsp;mm mortars,<ref name=segevs /> a [[paratrooper]] battalion trained in the new U.S.-built school and a new battalion of [[mechanized infantry]]. The [[Jordanian Army]], then known as the [[Arab Legion]], was a long-term-service, professional army, relatively well-equipped and well-trained. Israeli post-war briefings said that the Jordanian staff acted professionally, but was always left \"half a step\" behind by the Israeli moves. The small [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]] consisted of only 24 British-made [[Hawker Hunter]] fighters, six transports, and two helicopters. According to the Israelis, the Hawker Hunter was essentially on par with the French-built [[Dassault Mirage III]] \u2013 the IAF's best plane.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|pp=293\u201394}}\n\n100 Iraqi tanks and an infantry division were readied near the Jordanian border.

They were also aided by volunteer pilots from the [[Pakistan Air Force]] acting in an independent capacity.

Operation Focus was mainly conducted using French built aircraft.]]\nThe first and most critical move of the conflict was a surprise Israeli attack on the [[Egyptian Air Force]]. Initially, both Egypt and Israel announced that they had been attacked by the other country.<ref name=Quigley/>\n\nOn 5 June at 7:45 Israeli time, as [[civil defence siren]]s sounded all over Israel, the IAF launched [[Operation Focus]] (''Moked''). All but 12 of its nearly 200 operational jets<ref>Oren 2002, p. 172</ref> launched a mass attack against Egypt's [[airfield]]s.<ref>Bowen 2003, p. 99 (author interview with Moredechai Hod, 7 May 2002).</ref> The Egyptian defensive infrastructure was extremely poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter|hardened aircraft shelters]] capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes. Most of the Israeli warplanes headed out over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], flying low to avoid radar detection, before turning toward Egypt. Others flew over the [[Red Sea]].<ref name=\"Oren 2002\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"The War: Day One, June 5\".</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defence by effectively shutting down their entire air defence system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In any event, it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian [[radar]] cover and well below the lowest point at which its [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.<ref>Bowen 2003, pp. 114\u201315 (author interview with General Salahadeen Hadidi who presided over the first court martial of the heads of the air force and the air defence system after the war).</ref>\n\nAlthough the powerful Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] detected waves of aircraft approaching Egypt and reported the code word for \"war\" up the Egyptian command chain, Egyptian command and communications problems prevented the warning from reaching the targeted airfields.<ref name=\"Oren 2002\" /> The Israelis employed a mixed-attack strategy: bombing and [[strafing]] runs against planes parked on the ground, and bombing to disable runways with special [[tarmac-shredding penetration bomb]]s developed jointly with France, leaving surviving aircraft unable to take off. The runway at the [[Arish]] airfield was spared, as the Israelis expected to turn it into a military airport for their transports after the war. Surviving aircraft were taken out by later attack waves. The operation was more successful than expected, catching the Egyptians by surprise and destroying virtually all of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground, with few Israeli losses. Only four unarmed Egyptian training flights were in the air when the strike began.<ref>Oren 2002 p.&nbsp;171</ref> A total of 338 Egyptian aircraft were destroyed and 100 pilots were killed,{{sfn|Pollack|2005|p=474}} although the number of aircraft lost by the Egyptians is disputed.<ref>Oren, 176, says 282 out of 420. Morris, 318, says 304 out of 419. Mark Tessler, ''A History of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian Conflict'' (Indiana, 1994), p. 396, says over 350 planes were destroyed.</ref>\n\nAmong the Egyptian planes lost were all 30 [[Tu-16]] bombers, 27 out of 40 [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bombers, 12 [[Su-7]] fighter-bombers, over 90 [[MiG-21]]s, 20 [[MiG-19]]s, 25 [[MiG-17]] fighters, and around 32 assorted transport planes and helicopters. In addition, Egyptian radars and SAM missiles were also attacked and destroyed. The Israelis lost 19 planes, including two destroyed in air-to-air combat and 13 downed by anti-aircraft artillery.<ref>Long 1984, p. 19, Table 1.</ref> One Israeli plane, which was damaged and unable to break radio silence, was shot down by Israeli [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missiles]] after it strayed over the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]].<ref name=\"Oren178\">Oren, p. 178</ref> Another was destroyed by an exploding Egyptian bomber.<ref>Oren, p. 175</ref>\n\nThe attack guaranteed Israeli [[air supremacy]] for the rest of the war. Attacks on other Arab air forces by Israel took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts.\n\nThe large numbers of Arab aircraft claimed destroyed by Israel on that day were at first regarded as \"greatly exaggerated\" by the Western press. However, the fact that the Egyptian Air Force, along with other Arab air forces attacked by Israel, made practically no appearance for the remaining days of the conflict proved that the numbers were most likely authentic. Throughout the war, Israeli aircraft continued strafing Arab airfield runways to prevent their return to usability. Meanwhile, Egyptian state-run radio had reported an Egyptian victory, falsely claiming that 70 Israeli planes had been downed on the first day of fighting.<ref name=npr />\n\n=== Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula ===\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - conquest of Sinai 5-6 June.jpg|thumb|350px|Conquest of Sinai. 5\u20136 June 1967]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16401 Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|People in a bomb shelter at [[Kfar Maimon]]]]\n\nThe Egyptian forces consisted of seven [[division (military)|divisions]]: four [[Division (military)#Armored division|armoured]], two [[Division (military)#Armored division|infantry]], and one [[mechanized infantry]]. Overall, Egypt had around 100,000 troops and 900\u2013950 [[tank]]s in the Sinai, backed by 1,100 [[Armored personnel carrier|APCs]] and 1,000 [[artillery]] pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=59}} This arrangement was thought to be based on the Soviet doctrine, where mobile armour units at [[strategic depth]] provide a dynamic defense while infantry units engage in defensive battles.\n\nIsraeli forces concentrated on the border with Egypt included six armoured [[brigade]]s, one infantry brigade, one mechanized infantry brigade, three [[paratrooper]] brigades, giving a total of around 70,000 men and 700 tanks, who were organized in three armoured divisions. They had massed on the border the night before the war, camouflaging themselves and observing radio silence before being ordered to advance.\n\nThe Israeli plan was to surprise the Egyptian forces in both timing (the attack exactly coinciding with the IAF strike on Egyptian airfields), location (attacking via northern and central Sinai routes, as opposed to the Egyptian expectations of a repeat of the 1956 war, when the IDF attacked via the central and southern routes) and method (using a combined-force flanking approach, rather than direct tank assaults).\n\n==== Northern (El Arish) Israeli division ====\nOn 5 June, at 7:50&nbsp;a.m., the northernmost Israeli division, consisting of three brigades and commanded by Major General [[Israel Tal]], one of Israel's most prominent armour commanders, crossed the border at two points, opposite [[Nahal Oz]] and south of [[Khan Yunis]]. They advanced swiftly, holding fire to prolong the element of surprise. Tal's forces assaulted the \"Rafah Gap\", a seven-mile stretch containing the shortest of three main routes through the Sinai towards [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. The Egyptians had four divisions in the area, backed by minefields, pillboxes, underground bunkers, hidden gun emplacements and trenches. The terrain on either side of the route was impassable. The Israeli plan was to hit the Egyptians at selected key points with concentrated armour.<ref name=\"Oren178\" />\n\nTal's advance was led by the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Shmuel Gonen]]. The Israeli plan called for the 7th Brigade to outflank Khan Yunis from the north and the 60th Armored Brigade under Colonel Menachem Aviram would advance from the south. The two brigades would link up and surround Khan Yunis, while the paratroopers would take [[Rafah]]. Gonen entrusted the breakthrough to a single battalion of his brigade.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\">Oren, p. 180</ref>\n\nInitially, the advance was met with light resistance, as Egyptian intelligence had concluded that it was a diversion for the main attack. However, as Gonen's lead battalion advanced, it suddenly came under intense fire and took heavy losses. A second battalion was brought up, but was also pinned down. Meanwhile, the 60th Brigade became bogged down in the sand, while the paratroopers had trouble navigating through the dunes. The Israelis continued to press their attack, and despite heavy losses, cleared the Egyptian positions and reached the [[Khan Yunis]] railway junction in little over four hours.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\nGonen's brigade then advanced nine miles to Rafah in twin columns. Rafah itself was circumvented, and the Israelis attacked [[Sheikh Zuweid]], eight miles to the southwest, which was defended by two brigades. Though inferior in numbers and equipment, the Egyptians were deeply entrenched and camouflaged. The Israelis were pinned down by fierce Egyptian resistance, and called in air and artillery support to enable their lead elements to advance. Many Egyptians abandoned their positions after their commander and several of his staff were killed.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\nThe Israelis broke through with tank-led assaults. However, Aviram's forces misjudged the Egyptians' flank, and were pinned between strongholds before they were extracted after several hours. By nightfall, the Israelis had finished mopping up resistance. Israeli forces had taken significant losses, with Colonel Gonen later telling reporters that \"we left many of our dead soldiers in Rafah, and many burnt-out tanks.\" The Egyptians suffered some 2,000 casualties and lost 40 tanks.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\n==== Advance on Arish ====\n[[File:6 Day War-Amos.jpg|thumb|Israeli reconnaissance forces from the \"Shaked\" unit in Sinai during the war.]]\n\nOn 5 June, with the road open, Israeli forces continued advancing towards [[Arish]]. Already by late afternoon, elements of the 79th Armored Battalion had charged through the seven-mile long Jiradi defile, a narrow pass defended by well-emplaced troops of the Egyptian 112th Infantry Brigade. In fierce fighting, which saw the pass change hands several times, the Israelis charged through the position. The Egyptians suffered heavy casualties and tank losses, while Israeli losses stood at 66 dead, 93 wounded and 28 tanks. Emerging at the western end, Israeli forces advanced to the outskirts of Arish.<ref>Oren, p. 181</ref> As it reached the outskirts of Arish, Tal's division also consolidated its hold on Rafah and Khan Yunis.\n\nThe following day, 6 June, the Israeli forces on the outskirts of Arish were reinforced by the 7th Brigade, which fought its way through the Jiradi pass. After receiving supplies via an airdrop, the Israelis entered the city and captured the airport at 7:50&nbsp;am. The Israelis entered the city at 8:00&nbsp;am. Company commander [[Yossi Peled]] recounted that \"Al-Arish was totally quiet, desolate. Suddenly, the city turned into a madhouse. Shots came at us from every alley, every corner, every window and house.\" An IDF record stated that \"clearing the city was hard fighting. The Egyptians fired from the rooftops, from balconies and windows. They dropped grenades into our half-tracks and blocked the streets with trucks. Our men threw the grenades back and crushed the trucks with their tanks.\"<ref name=\"Oren202\">Oren, p. 202</ref><ref name=\"iweapons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/six_day_war/SixDayWar.html|title=Six Day War|publisher=Israeli-weapons|accessdate=1 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206185516/http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/six_day_war/SixDayWar.html|archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gonen sent additional units to Arish, and the city was eventually taken.\n\nBrigadier-General [[Avraham Yoffe]]'s assignment was to penetrate Sinai south of Tal's forces and north of Sharon's. Yoffe's attack allowed Tal to complete the capture of the Jiradi defile, Khan Yunis. All of them were taken after fierce fighting. Gonen subsequently dispatched a force of tanks, infantry and engineers under Colonel Yisrael Granit to continue down the Mediterranean coast towards the [[Suez Canal]], while a second force led by Gonen himself turned south and captured Bir Lahfan and Jabal Libni.\n\n==== Mid-front (Abu-Ageila) Israeli division ====\n[[File:Sharon ageila.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Major General [[Ariel Sharon]] during the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Battle of Abu-Ageila]]]]\n\nFurther south, on 6 June, the Israeli 38th Armored Division under Major-General [[Ariel Sharon]] assaulted [[Um-Katef]], a heavily fortified area defended by the Egyptian [[2nd Infantry Division (Egypt)|2nd Infantry Division]] under Major-General Sa'adi Naguib (though Naguib was actially absent{{Citation needed|reason=Major General's absence neither referenced here, nor in [[2nd Infantry Division (Egypt)]] article. Recommend adding reference to both articles.|date=April 2020}}) and consisting of some 16,000 troops. The Egyptians also had a [[battalion]] of [[tank destroyer]]s and a tank regiment, formed of Soviet World War II armour, which included 90 [[T-34 tank|T-34-85]] tanks, 22 [[SU-100]] tank destroyers, and about 16,000 men. The Israelis had about 14,000 men and 150 post-World War II tanks including the [[AMX-13]], [[Centurion tank|Centurions]], and [[M50 Super Sherman]]s (modified [[M-4 Sherman]] tanks).\n\nTwo armoured brigades in the meantime, under Avraham Yoffe, slipped across the border through sandy wastes that Egypt had left undefended because they were considered impassable. Simultaneously, Sharon's tanks from the west were to engage Egyptian forces on Um-Katef ridge and block any reinforcements. Israeli infantry would clear the three trenches, while heliborne paratroopers would land behind Egyptian lines and silence their artillery. An armoured thrust would be made at al-Qusmaya to unnerve and isolate its garrison.\n\n[[File:AMX-13-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|Israeli Armor of the Six Day War: pictured here the [[AMX 13]]]]\nAs Sharon's division advanced into the Sinai, Egyptian forces staged successful delaying actions at Tarat Umm, Umm Tarfa, and Hill 181. An Israeli jet was downed by anti-aircraft fire, and Sharon's forces came under heavy shelling as they advanced from the north and west. The Israeli advance, which had to cope with extensive minefields, took a large number of casualties. A column of Israeli tanks managed to penetrate the northern flank of Abu Ageila, and by dusk, all units were in position. The Israelis then brought up ninety 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm artillery guns for a preparatory barrage, while civilian buses brought reserve infantrymen under Colonel [[Yekutiel Adam]] and helicopters arrived to ferry the paratroopers. These movements were unobserved by the Egyptians, who were preoccupied with Israeli probes against their perimeter.<ref>Oren, p. 182</ref>\n\nAs night fell, the Israeli assault troops lit flashlights, each battalion a different color, to prevent [[friendly fire]] incidents. At 10:00&nbsp;pm, Israeli artillery began a barrage on Um-Katef, firing some 6,000 shells in less than twenty minutes, the most concentrated artillery barrage in Israel's history.<ref>Simon Dunstan,[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESv1lwg537AC&pg=PT125 ''The Six Day War 1967: Sinai''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101175251/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESv1lwg537AC&pg=PT125 |date=1 January 2016 }}, Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 125</ref><ref>Leslie Stein,[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT181 ''The Making of Modern Israel: 1948\u20131967''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101175251/https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT181 |date=1 January 2016 }}, Polity Press, 2013 p. 181.</ref> Israeli tanks assaulted the northernmost Egyptian defenses and were largely successful, though an entire armoured brigade was stalled by mines, and had only one mine-clearance tank. Israeli infantrymen assaulted the triple line of trenches in the east. To the west, paratroopers commanded by Colonel [[Danny Matt]] landed behind Egyptian lines, though half the helicopters got lost and never found the battlefield, while others were unable to land due to mortar fire.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 201\">Oren, p. 201</ref><ref name=\"Hammel 1992, p. 239\">Hammel 1992, p.&nbsp;239</ref> Those that successfully landed on target destroyed Egyptian artillery and ammunition dumps and separated gun crews from their batteries, sowing enough confusion to significantly reduce Egyptian artillery fire. Egyptian reinforcements from Jabal Libni advanced towards Um-Katef to counterattack, but failed to reach their objective, being subjected to heavy air attacks and encountering Israeli lodgements on the roads. Egyptian commanders then called in artillery attacks on their own positions. The Israelis accomplished and sometimes exceeded their overall plan, and had largely succeeded by the following day. The Egyptians took heavy casualties, while the Israelis lost 40 dead and 140 wounded.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 201\" /><ref name=\"Hammel 1992, p. 239\" />\n\nYoffe's attack allowed Sharon to complete the capture of the Um-Katef, after fierce fighting. The main thrust at Um-Katef was stalled due to mines and craters. After IDF engineers had cleared a path by 4:00&nbsp;pm, Israeli and Egyptian tanks engaged in fierce combat, often at ranges as close as ten yards. The battle ended in an Israeli victory, with 40 Egyptian and 19 Israeli tanks destroyed. Meanwhile, Israeli infantry finished clearing out the Egyptian trenches, with Israeli casualties standing at 14 dead and 41 wounded and Egyptian casualties at 300 dead and 100 taken prisoner.<ref>Oren, p. 212</ref>\n\n==== Other Israeli forces ====\nFurther south, on 5 June, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], initially positioned as a ruse to draw off Egyptian forces from the real invasion routes, attacked the fortified bunkers at Kuntilla, a strategically valuable position whose capture would enable Mandler to block reinforcements from reaching Um-Katef and to join Sharon's upcoming attack on [[Nekhel|Nakhl]]. The defending Egyptian battalion, outnumbered and outgunned, fiercely resisted the attack, hitting a number of Israeli tanks. However, most of the defenders were killed, and only three Egyptian tanks, one of them damaged, survived. By nightfall, Mendler's forces had taken Kuntilla.<ref name=\"Oren202\" />\n\nWith the exceptions of Rafah and Khan Yunis, Israeli forces had initially avoided entering the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] had expressly forbidden entry into the area. After Palestinian positions in Gaza opened fire on the Negev settlements of [[Nirim]] and [[Kissufim]], IDF Chief of Staff [[Yitzhak Rabin]] overrode Dayan's instructions and ordered the 11th Mechanized Brigade under Colonel Yehuda Reshef to enter the Strip. The force was immediately met with heavy artillery fire and fierce resistance from Palestinian forces and remnants of the Egyptian forces from Rafah.\n\nBy sunset, the Israelis had taken the strategically vital Ali Muntar ridge, overlooking [[Gaza City]], but were beaten back from the city itself. Some 70 Israelis were killed, along with Israeli journalist Ben Oyserman and American journalist [[Paul Schutzer]]. Twelve members of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] were also killed. On the war's second day, 6 June, the Israelis were bolstered by the 35th Paratroopers Brigade under Colonel [[Rafael Eitan]], and took Gaza City along with the entire Strip. The fighting was fierce, and accounted for nearly half of all Israeli casualties on the southern front. However, Gaza rapidly fell to the Israelis.\n\nMeanwhile, on 6 June, two Israeli reserve brigades under Yoffe, each equipped with 100 tanks, penetrated the Sinai south of Tal's division and north of Sharon's, capturing the road junctions of Abu Ageila, Bir Lahfan, and Arish, taking all of them before midnight. Two Egyptian armoured brigades counterattacked, and a fierce battle took place until the following morning. The Egyptians were beaten back by fierce resistance coupled with airstrikes, sustaining heavy tank losses. They fled west towards Jabal Libni.<ref>Oren, p. 211</ref>\n\n==== The Egyptian Army ====\nDuring the ground fighting, remnants of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] attacked Israeli ground forces, but took losses from the Israeli Air Force and from Israeli anti-aircraft units. Throughout the last four days, Egyptian aircraft flew 150 sorties against Israeli units in the Sinai.\n\nMany of the Egyptian units remained intact and could have tried to prevent the Israelis from reaching the [[Suez Canal]], or engaged in combat in the attempt to reach the canal. However, when the Egyptian Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] heard about the fall of [[Abu-Ageila]], he panicked and ordered all units in the Sinai to retreat. This order effectively meant the defeat of Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], having learned of the results of the Israeli air strikes, decided together with Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer|Amer]] to order a general retreat from the Sinai within 24 hours. No detailed instructions were given concerning the manner and sequence of withdrawal.<ref name=\"ahram1\">{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2007/848/sc1.htm |title=The road to Naksa |work=Al-Ahram |author=Mubasher, Abdou |date=7\u201313 June 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524214942/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2007/848/sc1.htm |archive-date=24 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Next fighting days ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - conquest of Sinai 7-8 June.jpg|thumb|350px|Conquest of Sinai. 7\u20138 June 1967]]\n[[File:1967-06-06 Mid-East.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:56|Newsreel from 6 June about the first Israeli-Egyptian fighting.]]\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Israeli Gun Boat.jpg|thumb|An Israeli gunboat passes through the Straits of Tiran near Sharm El Sheikh.]]\nAs Egyptian columns retreated, Israeli aircraft and artillery attacked them. Israeli jets used [[napalm]] bombs during their sorties. The attacks destroyed hundreds of vehicles and caused heavy casualties. At Jabal Libni, retreating Egyptian soldiers were fired upon by their own artillery. At Bir Gafgafa, the Egyptians fiercely resisted advancing Israeli forces, knocking out three tanks and eight half-tracks, and killing 20 soldiers. Due to the Egyptians' retreat, the Israeli High Command decided not to pursue the Egyptian units but rather to bypass and destroy them in the mountainous passes of West Sinai.\n\nTherefore, in the following two days ( 6 and 7 June), all three Israeli divisions (Sharon and Tal were reinforced by an armoured brigade each) rushed westwards and reached the passes. Sharon's division first went southward then westward, via [[An-Nakhl Fortress|An-Nakhl]], to [[Mitla Pass]] with air support. It was joined there by parts of Yoffe's division, while its other units blocked the [[Gidi Pass]]. These passes became killing grounds for the Egyptians, who ran right into waiting Israeli positions and suffered heavy losses in both soldiers and vehicles. According to Egyptian diplomat [[Mahmoud Riad]], 10,000 men were killed in one day alone, and many others died from hunger and thirst. Tal's units stopped at various points to the length of the Suez Canal.\n\nIsrael's blocking action was partially successful. Only the Gidi pass was captured before the Egyptians approached it, but at other places, Egyptian units managed to pass through and cross the canal to safety. Due to the haste of the Egyptian retreat, soldiers often abandoned weapons, military equipment, and hundreds of vehicles. Many Egyptian soldiers were cut off from their units had to walk about 200 kilometers on foot before reaching the Suez Canal with limited supplies of food and water and were exposed to intense heat. Thousands of soldiers died as a result. Many Egyptian soldiers chose instead to surrender to the Israelis. However, the Israelis eventually exceeded their capabilities to provide for prisoners. As a result, they began directing soldiers towards the Suez Canal and only taking prisoner high-ranking officers, who were expected to be exchanged for captured Israeli pilots.\n\nAccording to some accounts, during the Egyptian retreat from the Sinai, a unit of [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Soviet Marines]] based on a Soviet warship in [[Port Said]] at the time came ashore and attempted to cross the Suez Canal eastward. The Soviet force was reportedly decimated by an Israeli air attack and lost 17 dead and 34 wounded. Among the wounded was the commander, Lt. Col. Victor Shevchenko.<ref name=ginor>Ginor, Isabella and Remez, Gideon: ''The Soviet-Israeli War, 1967\u20131973: The USSR's Military Intervention in the Egyptian-Israeli Conflict'', p. 23</ref>\n\nDuring the offensive, the [[Israeli Navy]] landed six [[frogman|combat divers]] from the [[Shayetet 13]] naval commando unit to infiltrate [[Alexandria]] harbour. The divers sank an Egyptian [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] before being taken prisoner. Shayetet 13 commandos also infiltrated into [[Port Said]] harbour, but found no ships there. A planned commando raid against the [[Syrian Navy]] never materialized. Both Egyptian and Israeli warships made movements at sea to intimidate the other side throughout the war, but did not engage each other. However, Israeli warships and aircraft did hunt for Egyptian submarines throughout the war.\n\nOn 7 June, Israel began the conquest of [[Sharm el-Sheikh]]. The [[Israeli Navy]] started the operation with a probe of Egyptian naval defenses. An aerial reconnaissance flight found that the area was less defended than originally thought. At about 4:30&nbsp;am, three Israeli [[missile boat]]s opened fire on Egyptian shore batteries, while paratroopers and commandos boarded helicopters and [[Nord Noratlas]] transport planes for an assault on Al-Tur, as Chief of Staff Rabin was convinced it was too risky to land them directly in Sharm el-Sheikh.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 248\">Oren, p. 248</ref> However, the city had been largely abandoned the day before, and reports from air and naval forces finally convinced Rabin to divert the aircraft to Sharm el-Sheikh. There, the Israelis engaged in a pitched battle with the Egyptians and took the city, killing 20 Egyptian soldiers and taking 8 prisoner. At 12:15&nbsp;pm, Defense Minister Dayan announced that the Straits of Tiran constituted an international waterway open to all ships without restriction.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 248\" />\n\nOn 8 June, Israel completed the capture of the Sinai by sending infantry units to [[Ras Sudar]] on the western coast of the peninsula.\n\nSeveral tactical elements made the swift Israeli advance possible: first, the surprise attack that quickly gave the [[Israeli Air Force]] complete air superiority over the [[Egyptian Air Force]]; second, the determined implementation of an innovative battle plan; third, the lack of coordination among Egyptian troops. These factors would prove to be decisive elements on Israel's other fronts as well.\n\n=== West Bank ===\n{{See also|Jordanian campaign (1967)}}\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - The Jordan salient.jpg|thumb|400px|The Jordan [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]], 5\u20137 June.]]\n\n====Egyptian-control of Jordanian forces====\nKing Hussein had given control of his army to Egypt in 1 June, on which date Egyptian General Riad arrived in [[Amman]] to take control of the Jordanian military.{{efn|Shlaim writes: \u201cTo understand Hussein\u2019s conduct during the June 1967 War it is essential to recall that he had handed over command of his army to Egypt under the terms of his pact with Nasser. On 1 June, General Riad arrived in Amman and assumed command of the Jordanian armed forces.\u201d<ref>Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 112</ref>}}\n\nEgyptian Field Marshal Amer used the [[Fog of war|confusion]] of the first hours of the conflict to send a cable to Amman that he was victorious; he claimed as evidence a radar sighting of a squadron of Israeli aircraft returning from bombing raids in Egypt, which he said was an Egyptian aircraft en route to attack Israel.<ref>Oren 2002, pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185.</ref> In this cable, sent shortly before 9:00am, Riad was ordered to attack.{{efn|On the initial Jordanian attack, Shlaim writes: \u201cThe cable was from First Vice-President and Deputy Supreme Commander Field Marshal Abd al-Hakim Amer. Amer was a nincompoop who largely owed his rapid promotion to his friendship with Nasser... He was inexperienced in military affairs, impulsive, and prone to wishful thinking... Amer\u2019s cable to Riad was a pack of lies... On the basis of these alleged successes, Amer ordered Riad to open a new front against the enemy and launch offensive operations. By the time Hussein arrived at the headquarters, Riad had already given the orders for the artillery to move to the front lines and bombard Israeli air bases and other targets; an infantry brigade to occupy the Israeli enclave on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem; the two Egyptian commando battalions to infiltrate enemy territory from the West Bank at dusk; and the air force to be put on combat alert and commence air strikes immediately. Although these decisions were made in his absence, Hussein made no attempt to cancel them or to delay the opening of fire until the information from Cairo could be checked. Jordan was thus committed to war by the decision of an Egyptian general who was acting on the orders of a serial blunderer in Cairo.\u201d<ref>Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 113</ref>}}\n\n====Initial attack====\nOne of the Jordanian brigades stationed in the [[West Bank]] was sent to the [[Hebron]] area in order to link with the Egyptians.\n\nThe IDF's strategic plan was to remain on the defensive along the Jordanian front, to enable focus in the expected campaign against Egypt.\n\nIntermittent machine-gun exchanges began taking place in Jerusalem at 9:30&nbsp;am, and the fighting gradually escalated as the Jordanians introduced mortar and recoilless rifle fire. Under the orders from General Narkis, the Israelis responded only with small-arms fire, firing in a flat trajectory to avoid hitting civilians, holy sites or the Old City. At 10:00&nbsp;am on 5 June, the [[Jordanian Army]] began shelling Israel. Two batteries of 155&nbsp;mm [[155 mm Long Tom|Long Tom]] cannons opened fire on the suburbs of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The commanders of these batteries were instructed to lay a two-hour barrage against military and civilian settlements in central Israel. Some shells hit the outskirts of [[Tel Aviv]].<ref name=\"Washington Institute for Near East Policy 2002\">\"On June 5, Israel sent a message to Hussein urging him not to open fire.

The Jordanians initially targeted [[kibbutz]] [[Ramat Rachel]] in the south and [[Mount Scopus]] in the north, then ranged into the city center and outlying neighborhoods. Military installations, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the [[Knesset]] compound were also targeted. Israeli civilian casualties totalled 20 dead and about 1,000 wounded. Some 900 buildings were damaged, including [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital]].<ref name=\"Oren, p. 185-187\">Oren, pp. 185\u201387</ref>\n\nAt 11:50&nbsp;am, sixteen Jordanian Hawker Hunters attacked [[Netanya]], [[Kfar Sirkin]] and [[Kfar Saba]], killing one civilian, wounding seven and destroying a transport plane. Three Iraqi Hawker Hunters strafed civilian settlements in the Jezreel Valley, and an Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-16]] attacked [[Afula]], and was shot down near the Megiddo airfield. The attack caused minimal material damage, hitting only a senior citizens' home and several chicken coops, but sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed, most of them when the Tupolev crashed.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 185-187\" />\n\n==== Israeli cabinet meets ====\nWhen the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] convened to decide what to do, [[Yigal Allon]] and [[Menahem Begin]] argued that this was an opportunity to take the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], but [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]] decided to defer any decision until [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] could be consulted.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\">Shlaim, 2001, p.&nbsp;244.</ref> [[Uzi Narkiss]] made a number of proposals for military action, including the capture of [[Latrun]], but the cabinet turned him down.\nDayan rejected multiple requests from Narkiss for permission to mount an infantry assault towards Mount Scopus. However, Dayan sanctioned a number of more limited retaliatory actions.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 187-188\">Oren, pp. 187\u201388</ref>\n\n==== Initial response ====\nShortly before 12:30&nbsp;pm, the [[Israeli Air Force]] attacked Jordan's two airbases. The Hawker Hunters were refueling at the time of the attack. The Israeli aircraft attacked in two waves, the first of which cratered the runways and knocked out the control towers, and the second wave destroyed all 21 of Jordan's Hawker Hunter fighters, along with six transport aircraft and two helicopters. One Israeli jet was shot down by ground fire.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 187-188\" />\n\nIsraeli aircraft also attacked H-3, an [[Iraqi Air Force]] base in western Iraq. During the attack, 12 MiG-21s, 2 MiG-17s, 5 Hunter F6s, and 3 Il-28 bombers were destroyed or shot down. A [[Saiful Azam|Pakistani pilot stationed at the base]] shot down an Israeli fighter and a bomber during the raid. The Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli [[Fouga Magister]] jets attacked the Jordanian 40th Brigade with rockets as it moved south from the [[Damia Bridge|Damiya Bridge]]. Dozens of tanks were knocked out, and a convoy of 26 trucks carrying ammunition was destroyed. In Jerusalem, Israel responded to Jordanian shelling with a missile strike that devastated Jordanian positions. The Israelis used the L missile, a [[surface-to-surface]] missile developed jointly with [[France]] in secret.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 187-188\" />\n\n==== Jordanian battalion at Government House ====\n{{Further|Battle of Ammunition Hill}}\nA Jordanian battalion advanced up Government House ridge and dug in at the perimeter of Government House, the headquarters of the United Nations observers,<ref name=\"UNISPAL1347\">{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |title=United Nations June 5, 1967 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226202011/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>Oren, p. 187</ref><ref name=\"Shlaim p245\">Shlaim 2001, p.&nbsp;245.</ref> and opened fire on Ramat Rachel, the Allenby Barracks and the Jewish section of [[Abu Tor]] with mortars and recoilless rifles. UN observers fiercely protested the incursion into the neutral zone, and several manhandled a Jordanian machine gun out of Government House after the crew had set it up in a second-floor window. After the Jordanians occupied [[Jabel Mukaber]], an advance patrol was sent out and approached Ramat Rachel, where they came under fire from four civilians, including the wife of the director, who were armed with old Czech-made weapons.<ref>Oren, p. 188\u201389</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificamilitary.com/books/f-sixDaysInJune.html |title=Pacifica Military History \u2013 Free Samples |publisher=Pacificamilitary.com |date=5 June 1967 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308234307/http://www.pacificamilitary.com/books/f-sixDaysInJune.html |archive-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010036.JPG|thumb|Israeli paratroopers flush out Jordanian soldiers from trenches during the [[Battle of Ammunition Hill]].]]\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010039.JPG|thumb|Silhouette of Israeli paratroops advancing on Ammunition Hill.]]\nThe immediate Israeli response was an offensive to retake Government House and its ridge. The Jerusalem Brigade's Reserve Battalion 161, under Lieutenant-Colonel Asher Dreizin, was given the task. Dreizin had two infantry companies and eight tanks under his command, several of which broke down or became stuck in the mud at Ramat Rachel, leaving three for the assault. The Jordanians mounted fierce resistance, knocking out two tanks.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 191-192\">Oren, pp. 191\u201392</ref>\n\nThe Israelis broke through the compound's western gate and began clearing the building with grenades, before General [[Odd Bull]], commander of the UN observers, compelled the Israelis to hold their fire, telling them that the Jordanians had already fled. The Israelis proceeded to take the Antenna Hill, directly behind Government House, and clear out a series of bunkers to the west and south. The fighting, often conducted hand-to-hand, continued for nearly four hours before the surviving Jordanians fell back to trenches held by the Hittin Brigade, which were steadily overwhelmed. By 6:30&nbsp;pm, the Jordanians had retreated to [[Bethlehem]], having suffered about 100 casualties. All but ten of Dreizin's soldiers were casualties, and Dreizin himself was wounded three times.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 191-192\" />\n\n==== Israeli invasion ====\nDuring the late afternoon of 5 June, the Israelis launched an offensive to [[Six-Day War#West_Bank|encircle Jerusalem]], which lasted into the following day. During the night, they were supported by intense tank, artillery and mortar fire to soften up Jordanian positions. Searchlights placed atop the Labor Federation building, then the tallest in Israeli Jerusalem, exposed and blinded the Jordanians. The Jerusalem Brigade moved south of Jerusalem, while the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] and [[55th Paratroopers Brigade]] under [[Mordechai Gur]] encircled it from the north.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\">Oren, p. 222</ref>\n\nA combined force of tanks and paratroopers crossed no-man's land near the [[Mandelbaum Gate]]. One of Gur's paratroop battalions approached the fortified Police Academy. The Israelis used [[bangalore torpedo]]es to blast their way through barbed wire leading up to the position while exposed and under heavy fire. With the aid of two tanks borrowed from the Jerusalem Brigade, they captured the Police Academy. After receiving reinforcements, they moved up to attack [[Ammunition hill|Ammunition Hill]].<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\">http://www.sixdaywar.org/contest/easternfront.asp{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Jordanian defenders, who were heavily dug-in, fiercely resisted the attack. All of the Israeli officers except for two company commanders were killed, and the fighting was mostly led by individual soldiers. The fighting was conducted at close quarters in trenches and bunkers, and was often hand-to-hand. The Israelis captured the position after four hours of heavy fighting. During the battle, 36 Israeli and 71 Jordanian soldiers were killed.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\" />\n\nThe battalion subsequently drove east, and linked up with the Israeli enclave on [[Mount Scopus]] and its [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] campus. Gur's other battalions captured the other Jordanian positions around the [[American Colony, Jerusalem|American Colony]], despite being short on men and equipment and having come under a Jordanian mortar bombardment while waiting for the signal to advance.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\" />\n\nAt the same time, the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] attacked the fortress at [[Latrun]], which the Jordanians had abandoned due to heavy Israeli tank fire. The brigade attacked [[Har Adar]], but seven tanks were knocked out by mines, forcing the infantry to mount an assault without armoured cover. The Israeli soldiers advanced under heavy fire, jumping between stones to avoid mines. The fighting was conducted at close-quarters, often with knives and bayonets.\n\nThe Jordanians fell back after a battle that left two Israeli and eight Jordanian soldiers dead, and Israeli forces advanced through [[Beth-Horon|Beit Horon]] towards [[Ramallah]], taking four fortified villages along the way. By the evening, the brigade arrived in Ramallah. Meanwhile, the 163rd Infantry Battalion secured [[Abu Tor]] following a fierce battle, severing the Old City from Bethlehem and Hebron.\n\nMeanwhile, 600 Egyptian commandos stationed in the West Bank moved to attack Israeli airfields. Led by Jordanian intelligence scouts, they crossed the border and began infiltrating through Israeli settlements towards [[Ramla]] and [[Hatzor]]. They were soon detected and sought shelter in nearby fields, which the Israelis set on fire. Some 450 commandos were killed, and the remainder escaped to Jordan.<ref name=\"Oren203\">Oren, p. 203</ref>\n\nFrom the American Colony, the paratroopers moved towards the Old City. Their plan was to approach it via the lightly defended Salah al-Din Street. However, they made a wrong turn onto the heavily defended Nablus Road. The Israelis ran into fierce resistance. Their tanks fired at point-blank range down the street, while the paratroopers mounted repeated charges. Despite repelling repeated Israeli charges, the Jordanians gradually gave way to Israeli firepower and momentum. The Israelis suffered some 30 casualties \u2013 half the original force \u2013 while the Jordanians lost 45 dead and 142 wounded.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 222-223\">Oren, pp. 222\u201323</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli 71st Battalion breached barbed wire and minefields and emerged near Wadi Joz, near the base of Mount Scopus, from where the Old City could be cut off from Jericho and East Jerusalem from Ramallah. Israeli artillery targeted the one remaining route from Jerusalem to the West Bank, and shellfire deterred the Jordanians from counterattacking from their positions at Augusta-Victoria. An Israeli detachment then captured the [[Rockefeller Museum]] after a brief skirmish.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 222-223\" />\n\nAfterwards, the Israelis broke through to the Jerusalem-Ramallah road. At Tel al-Ful, the Israelis fought a running battle with up to thirty Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians stalled the advance and destroyed a number of half-tracks, but the Israelis launched air attacks and exploited the vulnerability of the external fuel tanks mounted on the Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians lost half their tanks, and retreated towards [[Jericho]]. Joining up with the 4th Brigade, the Israelis then descended through [[Shuafat]] and the site of what is now [[French Hill]], through Jordanian defenses at Mivtar, emerging at Ammunition Hill.<ref>Oren, p. 224</ref>\n\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010035.JPG|thumb|An Israeli airstrike near the Augusta-Victoria Hospital]]\nWith Jordanian defenses in Jerusalem crumbling, elements of the Jordanian 60th Brigade and an infantry battalion were sent from Jericho to reinforce Jerusalem. Its original orders were to repel the Israelis from the Latrun corridor, but due to the worsening situation in Jerusalem, the brigade was ordered to proceed to Jerusalem's Arab suburbs and attack [[Mount Scopus]]. Parallel to the brigade were infantrymen from the Imam Ali Brigade, who were approaching [[Al-Issawiya|Issawiya]]. The brigades were spotted by Israeli aircraft and decimated by rocket and cannon fire. Other Jordanian attempts to reinforce Jerusalem were beaten back, either by armoured ambushes or airstrikes.\n\nFearing damage to holy sites and the prospect of having to fight in built-up areas, Dayan ordered his troops not to enter the Old City.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\" /> He also feared that Israel would be subjected to a fierce international backlash and the outrage of Christians worldwide if it forced its way into the Old City. Privately, he told [[David Ben-Gurion]] that he was also concerned over the prospect of Israel capturing Jerusalem's holy sites, only to be forced to give them up under the threat of international sanctions.\n\n==== The West Bank ====\nIsrael was to gain almost total control of the West Bank by the evening of 7 June,{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}} and began its [[military occupation]] of the West Bank on that day, issuing a military order, the \"Proclamation Regarding Law and Administration (The West Bank Area) (No. 2)\u20141967\", which established the military government in the West Bank and granted the commander of the area full legislative, executive, and judicial power.<ref name=\"Weill2014\">{{citation|author=Sharon Weill|title=The Role of National Courts in Applying International Humanitarian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDnnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA19|date=February 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968542-4|page=19}}</ref><ref name=weill2007 /> Jordan had realised that it had no hope of defence as early as the morning of 6 June, just a day after the conflict had begun.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138-139}} At Nasser's request, Egypt's [[Abdul Munim Riad]] sent a situation update at midday on 6 June:{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}}\n<blockquote>The situation on the West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. A concentrated attack has been launched on all axes, together with heavy fire, day and night. Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi air forces in position H3 have been virtually destroyed. Upon consultation with King Hussein I have been asked to convey to you the following choices:\n:1. A political decision to cease fighting to be imposed by a third party (the USA, the Soviet Union or the Security Council).\n:2. To vacate the West Bank tonight.\n:3. To go on fighting for one more day, resulting in the isolation and destruction of the entire Jordanian Army.\nKing Hussein has asked me to refer this matter to you for an immediate reply.\"</blockquote>\n\nAn Egyptian order for Jordanian forces to withdraw across the Jordan River was issued at 10am on June 6; however that afternoon King Hussein learned of the impending [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 233]] and decided instead to hold out in the hope that a ceasefire would be implemented soon. It was already too late, as the counter-order caused confusion and in many cases it was not possible to regain positions which had previously been left.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=139}}\n\nOn 7 June, Dayan had ordered his troops not to enter the Old City; however, upon hearing that the UN was about to declare a ceasefire, he changed his mind, and without cabinet clearance, decided to capture it.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\" /> Two paratroop battalions attacked Augusta-Victoria Hill, high ground overlooking the Old City from the east. One battalion attacked from Mount Scopus, and another attacked from the valley between it and the Old City. Another paratroop battalion, personally led by Gur, broke into the Old City, and was joined by the other two battalions after their missions were complete. The paratroopers met little resistance. The fighting was conducted solely by the paratroopers; the Israelis did not use armour during the battle out of fear of severe damage to the Old City.\n\nIn the north, one battalion from Peled's division was sent to check Jordanian defenses in the Jordan Valley. A brigade belonging to Peled's division captured the western part of the West Bank. One brigade attacked Jordanian artillery positions around [[Jenin]], which were shelling [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The Jordanian 12th Armored Battalion, which outnumbered the Israelis, held off repeated attempts to capture Jenin. However, Israeli air attacks took their toll, and the Jordanian [[M48 Patton]]s, with their external fuel tanks, proved vulnerable at short distances, even to the Israeli-modified Shermans. Twelve Jordanian tanks were destroyed, and only six remained operational.<ref name=\"Oren203\" />\n\n[[File:Soldiers Western Wall 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[David Rubinger]]'s famed photograph of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] paratroopers at [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]] shortly after its capture. From left to right: Zion Karasenti, Yitzhak Yifat, and Haim Oshri.{{ref label|reference_name_A|a|none}}]]\nJust after dusk, Israeli reinforcements arrived. The Jordanians continued to fiercely resist, and the Israelis were unable to advance without artillery and air support. One Israeli jet attacked the Jordanian commander's tank, wounding him and killing his radio operator and intelligence officer. The surviving Jordanian forces then withdrew to Jenin, where they were reinforced by the 25th Infantry Brigade. The Jordanians were effectively surrounded in Jenin.<ref name=\"Oren203\" />\n\nJordanian infantry and their three remaining tanks managed to hold off the Israelis until 4:00&nbsp;am, when three battalions arrived to reinforce them in the afternoon. The Jordanian tanks charged, and knocked out multiple Israeli vehicles, and the tide began to shift. After sunrise, Israeli jets and artillery conducted a two-hour bombardment against the Jordanians. The Jordanians lost 10 dead and 250 wounded, and had only seven tanks left, including two without gas, and sixteen APCs. The Israelis then fought their way into Jenin, and captured the city after fierce fighting.<ref>Oren, p. 219</ref>\n\nAfter the Old City fell, the Jerusalem Brigade reinforced the paratroopers, and continued to the south, capturing [[Judea]] and [[Gush Etzion]]. [[Hebron]] was taken without any resistance. Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the [[1929 Hebron massacre|1929 massacre]] of the city's Jewish community, Hebron's residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops, and voluntarily gave up their weapons. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Harel Brigade proceeded eastward, descending to the [[Jordan River]].\n\nOn 7 June, Israeli forces seized [[Bethlehem]], taking the city after a brief battle that left some 40 Jordanian soldiers dead, with the remainder fleeing. On the same day, one of Peled's brigades seized [[Nablus]]; then it joined one of Central Command's armoured brigades to fight the Jordanian forces; as the Jordanians held the advantage of superior equipment and were equal in numbers to the Israelis.\n\nAgain, the air superiority of the IAF proved paramount as it immobilized the Jordanians, leading to their defeat. One of Peled's brigades joined with its Central Command counterparts coming from Ramallah, and the remaining two blocked the Jordan river crossings together with the Central Command's 10th. [[Combat Engineering Corps|Engineering Corps]] sappers blew up the Abdullah and Hussein bridges with captured Jordanian mortar shells, while elements of the Harel Brigade crossed the river and occupied positions along the east bank to cover them, but quickly pulled back due to American pressure. The Jordanians, anticipating an Israeli offensive deep into Jordan, assembled the remnants of their army and Iraqi units in Jordan to protect the western approaches to [[Amman]] and the southern slopes of the [[Golan Heights]].\n\nAs Israel continued its offensive on 7 June, taking no account of the UN ceasefire resolution, the Egyptian-Jordanian command ordered a full Jordanian withdrawal for the second time, in order to avoid an annihilation of the Jordanian army.<ref name=Mutawi140>{{harvnb|Mutawi|2002|p=140}}: \"Shortly after the order for the withdrawal had been issued [10.00 a.m. on 6 June], the Jordanians were informed that the UN Security Council was meeting to consider a resolution for an unconditional ceasefire. On learning of this the Jordanian command decided that the order for withdrawal had been premature, since if a ceasefire went into effect that day they would still be in possession of the West Bank. Consequently, the order was countermanded and those forces which had already withdrawn were asked to return to their original positions... The Security Council ceasefire resolution was passed unanimously at 11.00 p.m. on 6 June. However, Jordan's hope that this would enable it to hold the West Bank was destroyed when Israel continued its offensive. On learning of this Riad once again ordered a complete withdrawal from the West Bank as he feared that failure to do so would result in the annihilation of the remains of the Jordanian Army. By nightfall on 7 June most elements of the army had withdrawn to the East Bank and by mid-day on 8 June Jordan was once again the Transjordan of King Abdullah, while Israel completed total occupation of historical Palestine.\"</ref> This was complete by nightfall on 7 June.<ref name=Mutawi140/>\n\nAfter the Old City was captured, Dayan told his troops to \"dig in\" to hold it. When an armoured brigade commander entered the West Bank on his own initiative, and stated that he could see [[Jericho]], Dayan ordered him back. It was only after intelligence reports indicated that Hussein had withdrawn his forces across the Jordan River that Dayan ordered his troops to capture the West Bank.<ref name=\"Shlaim p245\" /> According to Narkis:\n\n<blockquote>First, the Israeli government had no intention of capturing the West Bank. On the contrary, it was opposed to it. Second, there was not any provocation on the part of the IDF. Third, the rein was only loosened when a real threat to Jerusalem's security emerged.

Syria had supported pre-war raids that had helped raise tensions and had routinely shelled Israel from the Heights, so some Israeli leaders wanted to see Syria punished.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"The War: Day Five, June 9\".</ref> Military opinion was that the attack would be extremely costly, since it would entail an uphill battle against a strongly fortified enemy. The western side of the Golan Heights consists of a rock escarpment that rises 500 meters (1,700&nbsp;ft) from the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]], and then flattens to a gently sloping plateau. Dayan opposed the operation bitterly at first, believing such an undertaking would result in losses of 30,000 and might trigger Soviet intervention. Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]], on the other hand, was more open to the possibility, as was the head of the Northern Command, [[David Elazar]], whose unbridled enthusiasm for and confidence in the operation may have eroded Dayan's reluctance.\n\nEventually, the situation on the Southern and Central fronts cleared up, intelligence estimated that the likelihood of Soviet intervention had been reduced, [[reconnaissance]] showed some Syrian defenses in the Golan region collapsing, and an intercepted cable revealed that Nasser was urging the President of Syria to immediately accept a cease-fire. At 3&nbsp;am on 9 June, Syria announced its acceptance of the cease-fire. Despite this announcement, Dayan became more enthusiastic about the idea and four hours later at 7&nbsp;am, \"gave the order to go into action against Syria\"{{ref label|reference_name_H1|i|none}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> without consultation or government authorisation.<ref>Morris, 2001, p. 325</ref>\n\nThe Syrian army consisted of about 75,000 men grouped in nine brigades, supported by an adequate amount of artillery and armour. Israeli forces used in combat consisted of two brigades (the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] and the [[Golani Brigade]]) in the northern part of the front at [[Givat HaEm]], and another two (infantry and one of Peled's brigades summoned from Jenin) in the center. The Golan Heights' unique terrain (mountainous slopes crossed by parallel streams every several kilometers running east to west), and the general lack of roads in the area channeled both forces along east-west axes of movement and restricted the ability of units to support those on either flank. Thus the Syrians could move north-south on the plateau itself, and the Israelis could move north-south at the base of the Golan escarpment. An advantage Israel possessed was the excellent intelligence collected by [[Mossad]] operative [[Eli Cohen]] (who was captured and executed in Syria in 1965) regarding the Syrian battle positions. Syria had built extensive defensive fortifications in depths up to 15 kilometers,<ref>Hammel 1992, p.&nbsp;387</ref> comparable to the [[Maginot Line]].\n\nAs opposed to all the other campaigns, IAF was only partially effective in the Golan because the fixed fortifications were so effective. However, the Syrian forces proved unable to put up effective defense largely because the officers were poor leaders and treated their soldiers badly; often officers would retreat from danger, leaving their men confused and ineffective. The Israelis also had the upper hand during close combat that took place in the numerous Syrian bunkers along the Golan Heights, as they were armed with the [[Uzi]], a [[submachine gun]] designed for close combat, while Syrian soldiers were armed with the heavier [[AK-47]] assault rifle, designed for combat in more open areas.\n\n==== Israeli attack: first day (9 June)====\n[[File:Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967. D327-098.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967]]\nOn the morning of 9 June, Israeli jets began carrying out dozens of sorties against Syrian positions from Mount Hermon to Tawfiq, using rockets salvaged from captured Egyptian stocks. The airstrikes knocked out artillery batteries and storehouses and forced transport columns off the roads. The Syrians suffered heavy casualties and a drop in morale, with a number of senior officers and troops deserting. The attacks also provided time as Israeli forces cleared paths through Syrian minefields. However, the airstrikes did not seriously damage the Syrians' bunkers and trench systems, and the bulk of Syrian forces on the Golan remained in their positions.<ref>Oren, p.280</ref>\n\nAbout two hours after the airstrikes began, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]], led by Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], advanced into the Golan Heights from [[Givat HaEm]]. Its advance was spearheaded by [[Engineering Corps (Israel)|Engineering Corps]] sappers and eight bulldozers, which cleared away barbed wire and mines. As they advanced, the force came under fire, and five bulldozers were immediately hit. The Israeli tanks, with their maneuverability sharply reduced by the terrain, advanced slowly under fire toward the fortified village of Sir al-Dib, with their ultimate objective being the fortress at Qala. Israeli casualties steadily mounted. Part of the attacking force lost its way and emerged opposite Za'ura, a redoubt manned by Syrian reservists. With the situation critical, Colonel Mandler ordered simultaneous assaults on Za'ura and Qala. Heavy and confused fighting followed, with Israeli and Syrian tanks struggling around obstacles and firing at extremely short ranges. Mandler recalled that \"the Syrians fought well and bloodied us. We beat them only by crushing them under our treads and by blasting them with our cannons at very short range, from 100 to 500 meters.\" The first three Israeli tanks to enter Qala were stopped by a Syrian bazooka team, and a relief column of seven Syrian tanks arrived to repel the attackers. The Israelis took heavy fire from the houses, but could not turn back, as other forces were advancing behind them, and they were on a narrow path with mines on either side. The Israelis continued pressing forward, and called for air support. A pair of Israeli jets destroyed two of the Syrian tanks, and the remainder withdrew. The surviving defenders of Qala retreated after their commander was killed. Meanwhile, Za'ura fell in an Israeli assault, and the Israelis also captured the 'Ein Fit fortress.<ref>Oren, pp. 281\u201382</ref>\n\nIn the central sector, the Israeli 181st Battalion captured the strongholds of Dardara and Tel Hillal after fierce fighting. Desperate fighting also broke out along the operation's northern axis, where [[Golani Brigade]] attacked thirteen Syrian positions, including the formidable Tel Fakhr position. Navigational errors placed the Israelis directly under the Syrians' guns. In the fighting that followed, both sides took heavy casualties, with the Israelis losing all nineteen of their tanks and half-tracks.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\">Oren, p. 283</ref> The Israeli battalion commander then ordered his twenty-five remaining men to dismount, divide into two groups, and charge the northern and southern flanks of Tel Fakhr. The first Israelis to reach the perimeter of the southern approach laid bodily down on the barbed wire, allowing their comrades to vault over them. From there, they assaulted the fortified Syrian positions. The fighting was waged at extremely close quarters, often hand-to-hand.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\" />\n\nOn the northern flank, the Israelis broke through within minutes and cleared out the trenches and bunkers. During the seven-hour battle, the Israelis lost 31 dead and 82 wounded, while the Syrians lost 62 dead and 20 captured. Among the dead was the Israeli battalion commander. The Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion took Tel 'Azzaziat, and Darbashiya also fell to Israeli forces.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\" />\n\n[[File:1967-06-09 Egypt Accepts UN Cease-Fire.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1:16|[[Universal Newsreel]] from 9 June about the war and UN reactions.]]\nBy the evening of 9 June, the four Israeli brigades had all broken through to the plateau, where they could be reinforced and replaced. Thousands of reinforcements began reaching the front, those tanks and half-tracks that had survived the previous day's fighting were refueled and replenished with ammunition, and the wounded were evacuated. By dawn, the Israelis had eight brigades in the sector.\n\nSyria's first line of defense had been shattered, but the defenses beyond that remained largely intact. Mount Hermon and the Banias in the north, and the entire sector between Tawfiq and Customs House Road in the south remained in Syrian hands. In a meeting early on the night of 9 June, Syrian leaders decided to reinforce those positions as quickly as possible, and to maintain a steady barrage on Israeli civilian settlements.\n\n==== Israeli attack: the next day (10 June)====\nThroughout the night, the Israelis continued their advance. Though it was slowed by fierce resistance, an anticipated Syrian counterattack never materialized. At the fortified village of Jalabina, a garrison of Syrian reservists, leveling their anti-aircraft guns, held off the Israeli 65th Paratroop Battalion for four hours before a small detachment managed to penetrate the village and knock out the heavy guns.\n\nMeanwhile, the 8th Brigade's tanks moved south from Qala, advancing six miles to Wasit under heavy artillery and tank bombardment. At the Banias in the north, Syrian mortar batteries opened fire on advancing Israeli forces only after Golani Brigade sappers cleared a path through a minefield, killing sixteen Israeli soldiers and wounding four.\n\nOn the next day, 10 June, the central and northern groups joined in a [[pincer movement]] on the plateau, but that fell mainly on empty territory as the Syrian forces retreated. At 8:30&nbsp;am, the Syrians began blowing up their own bunkers, burning documents and retreating. Several units joined by Elad Peled's troops climbed to the Golan from the south, only to find the positions mostly empty. When the 8th Brigade reached Mansura, five miles from Wasit, the Israelis met no opposition and found abandoned equipment, including tanks, in perfect working condition. In the fortified Banias village, Golani Brigade troops found only several Syrian soldiers chained to their positions.<ref>Oren, p. 295</ref>\n\nDuring the day, the Israeli units stopped after obtaining manoeuvre room between their positions and a line of volcanic hills to the west. In some locations, Israeli troops advanced after an agreed-upon cease-fire<ref>{{cite video|year=1960|title=Video: Cease-Fire.

Israel's strategic depth grew to at least 300 kilometers in the south, 60 kilometers in the east, and 20 kilometers of extremely rugged terrain in the north, a security asset that would prove useful in the [[Yom Kippur War]] six years later.\n\nSpeaking three weeks after the war ended, as he accepted an honorary degree from Hebrew University, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] gave his reasoning behind the success of Israel:\n\n:Our airmen, who struck the enemies' planes so accurately that no one in the world understands how it was done and people seek technological explanations or secret weapons; our armoured troops who beat the enemy even when their equipment was inferior to his; our soldiers in all other branches \u2026 who overcame our enemies everywhere, despite the latter's superior numbers and fortifications\u2014all these revealed not only coolness and courage in the battle but \u2026 an understanding that only their personal stand against the greatest dangers would achieve victory for their country and for their families, and that if victory was not theirs the alternative was annihilation.<ref>Sachar 1976. p.&nbsp;660.</ref>\n\nIn recognition of contributions, Rabin was given the honour of naming the war for the Israelis. From the suggestions proposed, including the \"War of Daring\", \"War of Salvation\", and \"War of the Sons of Light\", he \"chose the least ostentatious, the Six-Day War, evoking the days of creation\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"Aftershocks\".</ref>\n\nDayan's final report on the war to the Israeli general staff listed several shortcomings in Israel's actions, including misinterpretation of Nasser's intentions, overdependence on the United States, and reluctance to act when Egypt closed the Straits. He also credited several factors for Israel's success: Egypt did not appreciate the advantage of striking first and their adversaries did not accurately gauge Israel's strength and its willingness to use it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn Egypt, according to [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal|Heikal]], Nasser had admitted his responsibility for the military defeat in June 1967.<ref name=\"PodehWinckler2004p110\" /> According to historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan, Nasser's mistaken decisions to expel the international peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and close the Straits of Tiran in 1967 led to a state of war with Israel, despite Egypt's lack of military preparedness.<ref name=\"PodehWinckler2004p105\" />\n\nAfter the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Egypt reviewed the causes of its loss of the 1967 war.

The Golans would have to be demilitarized and special arrangement would be negotiated for the Straits of Tiran. The government also resolved to open negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan regarding the Eastern border.<ref>Herzog 1989, p.&nbsp;253.</ref>}}\n\nThe 19 June Israeli cabinet decision did not include the [[Gaza Strip]], and left open the possibility of Israel permanently acquiring parts of the [[West Bank]]. On 25\u201327 June, Israel incorporated [[East Jerusalem]] together with areas of the West Bank to the north and south into Jerusalem's new municipal boundaries.\n\nThe Israeli decision was to be conveyed to the Arab nations by the United States. The U.S. was informed of the decision, but not that it was to transmit it. There is no evidence of receipt from Egypt or Syria, and some historians claim that they may never have received the offer.<ref>Shlaim 2001, p.&nbsp;254.</ref>\n\nIn September, the [[Khartoum Resolution|Khartoum Arab Summit]] resolved that there would be \"no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel\". However, as [[Avraham Sela]] notes, the Khartoum conference effectively marked a shift in the perception of the conflict by the Arab states away from one centered on the question of Israel's legitimacy, toward one focusing on territories and boundaries. This was shown on 22 November when Egypt and Jordan accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]].<ref>Sela 1997, p.&nbsp;108.</ref> [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel.

Resolution 242 recognized the right of \"every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.\" Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1978, after the [[Camp David Accords]]. In the summer of 2005, Israel [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|withdrew all military forces]] and evacuated all civilians from the Gaza Strip.

The vast majority of the populations in both territories declined to take citizenship. See also [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and [[Golan Heights]].\n\nIn his book ''Righteous Victims'' (1999), Israeli \"[[New Historian]]\" [[Benny Morris]] writes:\n{{quote|In three villages southwest of Jerusalem and at Qalqilya, houses were destroyed \"not in battle, but as punishment ... and in order to chase away the inhabitants ... contrary to government ... policy,\" Dayan wrote in his memoirs. In Qalqilya, about a third of the homes were razed and about 12,000 inhabitants were evicted, though many then camped out in the environs. The evictees in both areas were allowed to stay and later were given cement and tools by the Israeli authorities to rebuild at least some of their dwellings.\n\nBut many thousands of other Palestinians now took to the roads. Perhaps as many as seventy thousand, mostly from the Jericho area, fled during the fighting; tens of thousands more left over the following months. Altogether, about one-quarter of the population of the West Bank, about 200\u2013250,000 people, went into exile. ... They simply walked to the Jordan River crossings and made their way on foot to the East Bank. It is unclear how many were intimidated or forced out by the Israeli troops and how many left voluntarily, in panic and fear. There is some evidence of IDF soldiers going around with loudspeakers ordering West Bankers to leave their homes and cross the Jordan. Some left because they had relatives or sources of livelihood on the East Bank and feared being permanently cut off.\n\nThousands of Arabs were taken by bus from East Jerusalem to the [[Allenby Bridge]], though there is no evidence of coercion. The free Israeli-organized transportation, which began on June 11, 1967, went on for about a month. At the bridge they had to sign a document stating that they were leaving of their own free will. Perhaps as many as 70,000 people emigrated from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.\n\nOn July 2, the Israeli government announced that it would allow the return of those 1967 refugees who desired to do so, but no later than August 10, later extended to September 13. The Jordanian authorities probably pressured many of the refugees, who constituted an enormous burden, to sign up to return. In practice only 14,000 of the 120,000 who applied were allowed by Israel back into the West Bank by the beginning of September. After that, only a trickle of \"special cases\" were allowed back, perhaps 3,000 in all. (328\u201329)}}\n\nIn addition, between 80,000 and 110,000 Syrians fled the Golan Heights,<ref>Morris (2001) p.&nbsp;327</ref> of which about 20,000 were from the city of Quneitra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487614/al-Qunaytirah |title=Al-Qunay\u1e6dirah |accessdate=18 July 2010 |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |year=2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927074414/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487614/al-Qunaytirah |archive-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to more recent research by the Israeli daily ''[[Haaretz]]'', a total of 130,000 Syrian inhabitants fled or were expelled from the territory, most of them pushed out by the Israeli army.<ref>Shay Fogelman, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-disinherited-1.304959 \"The disinherited\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919203211/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-disinherited-1.304959 |date=19 September 2010 }}, ''Haaretz'', 30 July 2010</ref>\n\n=== Long term ===\nIsrael made peace with Egypt following the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978 and completed a staged withdrawal from the Sinai in 1982. However, the position of the other [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] has been a long-standing and bitter cause of conflict for decades between Israel and the Palestinians, and the Arab world in general. Jordan and Egypt eventually withdrew their claims to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, respectively. Israel and Jordan signed a [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty in 1994]].\n\nAfter the Israeli occupation of these territories, the [[Gush Emunim]] movement launched a [[Israeli settlement|large settlement effort]] in these areas to secure a permanent foothold. There are now hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in the West Bank. They are a matter of controversy within Israel, both among the general population and within different political administrations, supporting them to varying degrees. Palestinians consider them a provocation. The Israeli settlements in Gaza were evacuated in August 2005 as a part of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel's disengagement from Gaza]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abba Eban]], Israeli Foreign Minister\n* [[Hafez al-Assad]], Syrian Defense Minister\n* ''[[Catch 67]]'', a 2017 Israeli philosophy book on the West Bank occupation that launched a public dialogue on the war's 50th anniversary\n* [[Israeli MIAs]]\n* [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Soviet leader\n* [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East]]\n* [[Robert McNamara]], U.S. Defense Secretary\n* [[Syrian towns and villages depopulated in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]\n* [[U Thant]], Secretary General of the United Nations\n\n== Notes ==\n1. {{note label|reference_name_A|a|none|&nbsp;Photograph:}}\n:It was twenty minutes after the capture of the Western Wall that [[David Rubinger]] shot his \"signature\" photograph of three Israeli paratroopers gazing in wonder up at the wall [{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0003/arm01.htm |title=June 10, 1967 \u2013 Israeli paratroopers reach the Western Wall |publisher=The Digital Journalist |first=Yoram |last=Kaniuk |accessdate=2 December 2008}}].

However, should Jordan open hostilities, we shall react with all our might, and the king will have to bear the full responsibility of the consequences.\" King Hussein told General Bull that it was too late; the die was cast.\"}}</ref>\n\n<!--ref name=Shlaim2012p106>{{cite book |last=Shlaim |first=Avi |title=The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YhNPNeBh8IC&pg=PA106 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |page=106 |isbn=978-1-107-00236-4 |quote=Nasser responded by taking three successive steps that made war virtually inevitable: he deployed his troops in Sinai near Israel's border on 14 May; expelled the UNEF from the Gaza Strip and Sinai on 19 May; and closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping on 22 May.}}</ref-->\n\n<!--ref name=SchiffHaber1976p11>''Israel, Army and defense \u2013 A dictionary'', [[Zeev Schiff]] & [[Eitan Haber]], editors, Zmora, Bitan, Modan, 1976, Tel Aviv [[Hebrew]]</ref-->\n\n<!--ref name=\"Rubin\">{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Barry M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbQKILIgAwQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1994|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-76803-1|page=11|title=Revolution Until Victory?: The Politics and History of the PLO}}</ref-->\n\n<!--ref name=\"TimeSamu1\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843082,00.html#ixzz0c1lwqMPn Middle East: Incident at Samu], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 25 November 1966</ref-->\n\n<ref name=Tessler1994p378>{{cite book|last=Tessler|first=Mark|title=A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-253-20873-6|page=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kbU4BIAcrQC&pg=PA378|quote=Towards the War of June 1967: Growing tensions in the region were clearly visible long before Israel's November attack on Samu and two other West Bank towns.

Most infiltrations to Israel after 1965 originated from the Syrian border. Syria also increased its own military actions against Israel by shelling Israeli settlements in the border area. These actions entailed significant costs, as Israeli artillery and air force repeatedly pounded Syrian positions on the Golan Height. Yet, as long as Israel's responses were limited and did not involve any raids on Syrian positions, this was an acceptable price for the struggling regime in Damascus.<P>By the fall of 1966 and spring of 1967, things seemed to be getting out of hand. Israeli-initiated encroachments into the demilitarized zones (DMZ) along the Syrian border became more frequent and intense. Israeli leaders made repeated statements to the effect that the Syrian regime was directly responsible for the border clashes and that Israel may act directly against the Syrian regime}}</ref-->\n\n<!-- <ref name=\"CIAestimate1967\">{{cite web|author1=Sherman Kent for the Central Intelligence Agency's Board of National Estimates|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964\u20131968 Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Document 79 79.

As of the moment he has vastly enhanced his own prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world, diminished the standing of Israel and, at least for the moment, administered a serious setback to the US. Moreover, by simply standing where he is he places the Israelis in an extremely difficult position. He keeps the crisis at high pitch, and as long as this continues the Israelis must remain mobilized. This they cannot do for long without adverse effects upon their economy. 5. The Israelis face dismaying choices. Surprised and shaken by Nasser's action, they failed to take the instant military counteraction which might have been most effective. If they attack now they will face far more formidable opposition than in the rapid campaign of 1956. We believe that they would still be able to drive the Egyptians away from the entrance to the Strait of Tiran, but it would certainly cost them heavy losses of men and materiel. We are not sure that they have sufficient stockpiles of ammunition and equipment for a war lasting more than three or four weeks, and it is possible that they would not embark upon a major campaign without prior assurances from the US of adequate resupply.|access-date=14 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627044650/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d79|archive-date=27 June 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=Colonomos2013p25>{{cite book |last=Colonomos |first=Ariel |title=The Gamble of War: Is it Possible to Justify Preventive War? |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_YSWUQvAIEUC&pg=PA25&dq=Egypt+carried+out+mass+mobilization+of+its+troops+on+the+Israeli+border+and+during+the+night+of+May+22%E2%80%9323,+Nasser+decided+to+close+the+Straits+of+Tiran,+which+control+access+to+the+Red+Sea,+to+Israeli+shipping#v=onepage&q=Egypt%20carried%20out%20mass%20mobilization%20of%20its%20troops%20on%20the%20Israeli%20border%20and%20during%20the%20night%20of%20May%2022%E2%80%9323%2C%20Nasser%20decided%20to%20close%20the%20Straits%20of%20Tiran%2C%20which%20control%20access%20to%20the%20Red%20Sea%2C%20to%20Israeli%20shipping&f=false |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2013 |page=25 |isbn=978-1-137-01894-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gat2003p202>{{cite book |last=Gat |first=Moshe |title=Britain and the Conflict in the Middle East, 1964\u20131967: The Coming of the Six-Day War |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ntLdA8QIgXIC&pg=PA202&dq=On+the+night+of+May+22-23,+Nasser+declared+the+Gulf+of+Aqaba+closed+to+Israeli+shipping#v=onepage&q=On%20the%20night%20of%20May%2022-23%2C%20Nasser%20declared%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Aqaba%20closed%20to%20Israeli%20shipping&f=false |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=202 |isbn=978-0-275-97514-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MeirStraitsSpeech\">\"Interference, by armed force, with ships of Israeli flag exercising free and innocent passage in the Gulf of Aqaba and through the Straits of Tiran will be regarded by Israel as an attack entitling it to exercise its inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter and to take all such measures as are necessary to ensure the free and innocent passage of its ships in the Gulf and in the Straits.\" {{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/26+Statement+to+the+General+Assembly+by+Foreign+Mi.htm |title=Statement to the General Assembly by Foreign Minister Meir, 1 March 1957 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2013 The State of Israel |access-date=13 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013232255/http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/26+Statement+to+the+General+Assembly+by+Foreign+Mi.htm |archive-date=13 October 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* al-Qusi, Abdallah Ahmad Hamid.

In 1956 [[Suez Crisis#The Israeli operation Kadesh in Sinai|Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula]] in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the [[Straits of Tiran]] that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was eventually forced to withdraw, but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. A [[United Nations Emergency Force]] was deployed along the border, but there was no [[demilitarisation]] agreement.<ref name=\"Rikhye2013\">{{cite book|author=Major General Indar Jit Rikhye|title=The Sinai Blunder: Withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force Leading....|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teHWAQAAQBAJ&pg=PR8|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-27985-0|pages=8\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the months prior to June 1967, [[Origins of the Six-Day War|tensions became dangerously heightened]]. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war (a ''[[casus belli]]''). In May Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel. On 5 June, Israel launched what it claimed were a series of [[Preemptive war|preemptive]] airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. The question of which side caused the war is one of a number of [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War|controversies relating to the conflict]].\n\nThe Egyptians were caught by surprise, and nearly the entire Egyptian air force was destroyed with few Israeli losses, giving the Israelis [[air supremacy]]. Simultaneously, the Israelis launched a ground offensive into the [[Gaza Strip]] and the Sinai, which again caught the Egyptians by surprise. After some initial resistance, Nasser ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward in pursuit of the Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and [[Israeli occupation of Sinai|conquered the Sinai]].\n\nJordan had entered into a defence pact with Egypt a week before the war began; the agreement envisaged that in the event of war Jordan would not take an offensive role but would attempt to tie down Israeli forces to prevent them making territorial gains.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=183|ps=: \u201cIt is clear that King Hussein joined forces with Egypt in the knowledge that there was no possibility of overrunning Israel. Instead he sought to preserve the status quo. He believed that he could not stand aside at a time when Arab co-operation and solidarity were vital and he was convinced that any Arab confrontation with Israel would be greatly enhanced if the Arabs fought as a unified body. The plan of action devised at his meeting with Nasser in Cairo on 30 May was established on this basis. It was envisaged that Jordan would not take an offensive role but would tie down a proportion of Israel's forces and so prevent it from using its full weight against Egypt and Syria. By forcing Israel to fight a war on three fronts simultaneously King Hussein believed that the Arabs stood a chance of preventing it from making any territorial gains while allowing the Arabs a chance of gaining a political victory, which may, eventually, lead to peace. King Hussein was also convinced that even if Jordan did not participate in the war Israel would take the opportunity to seize the West Bank once it had dealt with Syria and Egypt. He decided that for this reason the wisest course of action was to bring Jordan into the total Arab effort. This would provide his army with two elements which were essential for its efficient operation \u2013 additional troops and air cover. When King Hussein met Nasser in Cairo it was agreed that these requirements would be met.\u201d}} About an hour after the Israeli air attack, the Egyptian commander of the Jordanian army was ordered by Cairo to begin attacks on Israel; in the initially confused situation, the Jordanians were told that Egypt had repelled the Israeli air strikes.\n\nEgypt and Jordan agreed to a ceasefire on 8 June, and Syria agreed on 9 June; a ceasefire was signed with Israel on 11 June. In the aftermath of the war, Israel had crippled the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian militaries, having killed over 20,000 troops while only losing fewer than 1,000 of its own. The Israeli success was the result of a well-prepared and enacted strategy, the poor leadership of the Arab states, and their poor military leadership and strategy. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel's international standing greatly improved in the following years. Its victory humiliated Egypt, Jordan and Syria, leading Nasser to resign in shame; he was later reinstated after protests in Egypt against his resignation. The speed and ease of Israel's victory would later lead to a dangerous overconfidence within the ranks of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), contributing to initial Arab successes in the subsequent 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], although ultimately Israeli forces were successful and defeated the Arab militaries. The displacement of civilian populations resulting from the war would have long-term consequences, as 300,000 [[Palestinians]] fled the West Bank and about 100,000 Syrians left the Golan Heights. Across the Arab world, Jewish minority communities fled or were expelled, with refugees going mainly to Israel or Europe.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Origins of the Six-Day War}}\n[[File:Nasser and Egyptian pilots pre-1967.gif|thumb|On 22 May 1967, President Nasser addressed his pilots at [[Bir Gifgafa Airfield]] in Sinai: \"The Jews are threatening war \u2013 we say to them [[wikt:\u0623\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627|ahlan wa-sahlan]] (welcome)!\"<ref name=\"Gluska2007p152\" />]]\n<!--\nPLEASE DO NOT ADD TEXT TO THE BACKGROUND SECTION WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING CONSENSUS AGREEMENT ON THE TALK PAGE.

The following day, at Jordan's invitation, the Iraqi army began deploying troops and armoured units in Jordan.<ref>Churchill po. 52 and 77</ref> They were later reinforced by an Egyptian contingent. On 1 June, Israel formed a [[National Unity Government]] by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched [[Operation Focus]], a large-scale, surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six-Day War.\n\n=== Military preparation ===\nBefore the war, Israeli pilots and ground crews had trained extensively in rapid refitting of aircraft returning from [[sortie]]s, enabling a single aircraft to sortie up to four times a day (as opposed to the norm in Arab air forces of one or two sorties per day). This enabled the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) to send several attack waves against Egyptian airfields on the first day of the war, overwhelming the Egyptian Air Force, and allowed it to knock out other Arab air forces on the same day. This has contributed to the Arab belief that the IAF was helped by foreign air forces (see [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War#Combat support|Controversies relating to the Six-Day War]]). Pilots were extensively schooled about their targets, and were forced to memorise every single detail, and rehearsed the operation multiple times on dummy runways in total secrecy.\n\nThe Egyptians had constructed fortified defences in the Sinai. These designs were based on the assumption that an attack would come along the few roads leading through the desert, rather than through the difficult desert terrain. The Israelis chose not to risk attacking the Egyptian defences head-on, and instead surprised them from an unexpected direction.\n\nJames Reston, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 23 May 1967, noted, \"In discipline, training, morale, equipment and general competence his [Nasser's] army and the other Arab forces, without the direct assistance of the Soviet Union, are no match for the Israelis. ... Even with 50,000 troops and the best of his generals and air force in Yemen, he has not been able to work his way in that small and primitive country, and even his effort to help the Congo rebels was a flop.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Reston, James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/24/archives/washington-nassers-reckless-maneuvers-cairo-and-moscow-the-us.html |title=Washington: Nasser's Reckless Maneuvers; Cairo and Moscow The U.S. Commitment The Staggering Economy Moscow's Role |work=The New York Times |date=24 May 1967 |page=46 |access-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706021950/https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/24/archives/washington-nassers-reckless-maneuvers-cairo-and-moscow-the-us.html |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the war, Israel believed it could win a war in 3\u20134 days.

The Israeli Northern Command comprised a division of three brigades led by Major General [[Elad Peled]] which was stationed in the [[Jezreel Valley]] to the north of the West Bank.\n\nOn the eve of the war, Egypt massed approximately 100,000 of its 160,000 troops in the Sinai, including all seven of its divisions (four infantry, two armoured and one mechanized), four independent infantry brigades and four independent armoured brigades. Over a third of these soldiers were veterans of Egypt's continuing intervention into the [[North Yemen Civil War]] and another third were reservists.

Despite the bombastic and jingoistic rhetoric, the Bathist regime viewed its actions against Israel as low-level warfare that was not meant to lead to all-out war. The months and years prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war were filled with military purges associated with actual and attempted coups that decimated and further fractured the military and party, resulting in an inexperienced officer corps as well as a deep distrust between the rank and file and officers in the army. In addition, there were uprisings by discontented elements of the Syrian population, less than satisfactory encounters with Israeli forces, and lukewarm Soviet support...

Operation Focus was mainly conducted using French built aircraft.]]\nThe first and most critical move of the conflict was a surprise Israeli attack on the [[Egyptian Air Force]]. Initially, both Egypt and Israel announced that they had been attacked by the other country.<ref name=Quigley/>\n\nOn 5 June at 7:45 Israeli time, as [[civil defence siren]]s sounded all over Israel, the IAF launched [[Operation Focus]] (''Moked''). All but 12 of its nearly 200 operational jets<ref>Oren 2002, p. 172</ref> launched a mass attack against Egypt's [[airfield]]s.<ref>Bowen 2003, p. 99 (author interview with Moredechai Hod, 7 May 2002).</ref> The Egyptian defensive infrastructure was extremely poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter|hardened aircraft shelters]] capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes. Most of the Israeli warplanes headed out over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], flying low to avoid radar detection, before turning toward Egypt. Others flew over the [[Red Sea]].<ref name=\"Oren 2002\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"The War: Day One, June 5\".</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defence by effectively shutting down their entire air defence system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In any event, it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian [[radar]] cover and well below the lowest point at which its [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.<ref>Bowen 2003, pp. 114\u201315 (author interview with General Salahadeen Hadidi who presided over the first court martial of the heads of the air force and the air defence system after the war).</ref>\n\nAlthough the powerful Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] detected waves of aircraft approaching Egypt and reported the code word for \"war\" up the Egyptian command chain, Egyptian command and communications problems prevented the warning from reaching the targeted airfields.<ref name=\"Oren 2002\" /> The Israelis employed a mixed-attack strategy: bombing and [[strafing]] runs against planes parked on the ground, and bombing to disable runways with special [[tarmac-shredding penetration bomb]]s developed jointly with France, leaving surviving aircraft unable to take off. The runway at the [[Arish]] airfield was spared, as the Israelis expected to turn it into a military airport for their transports after the war. Surviving aircraft were taken out by later attack waves. The operation was more successful than expected, catching the Egyptians by surprise and destroying virtually all of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground, with few Israeli losses. Only four unarmed Egyptian training flights were in the air when the strike began.<ref>Oren 2002 p.&nbsp;171</ref> A total of 338 Egyptian aircraft were destroyed and 100 pilots were killed,{{sfn|Pollack|2005|p=474}} although the number of aircraft lost by the Egyptians is disputed.<ref>Oren, 176, says 282 out of 420. Morris, 318, says 304 out of 419. Mark Tessler, ''A History of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian Conflict'' (Indiana, 1994), p. 396, says over 350 planes were destroyed.</ref>\n\nAmong the Egyptian planes lost were all 30 [[Tu-16]] bombers, 27 out of 40 [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bombers, 12 [[Su-7]] fighter-bombers, over 90 [[MiG-21]]s, 20 [[MiG-19]]s, 25 [[MiG-17]] fighters, and around 32 assorted transport planes and helicopters. In addition, Egyptian radars and SAM missiles were also attacked and destroyed. The Israelis lost 19 planes, including two destroyed in air-to-air combat and 13 downed by anti-aircraft artillery.<ref>Long 1984, p. 19, Table 1.</ref> One Israeli plane, which was damaged and unable to break radio silence, was shot down by Israeli [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missiles]] after it strayed over the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]].<ref name=\"Oren178\">Oren, p. 178</ref> Another was destroyed by an exploding Egyptian bomber.<ref>Oren, p. 175</ref>\n\nThe attack guaranteed Israeli [[air supremacy]] for the rest of the war. Attacks on other Arab air forces by Israel took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts.\n\nThe large numbers of Arab aircraft claimed destroyed by Israel on that day were at first regarded as \"greatly exaggerated\" by the Western press. However, the fact that the Egyptian Air Force, along with other Arab air forces attacked by Israel, made practically no appearance for the remaining days of the conflict proved that the numbers were most likely authentic. Throughout the war, Israeli aircraft continued strafing Arab airfield runways to prevent their return to usability. Meanwhile, Egyptian state-run radio had reported an Egyptian victory, falsely claiming that 70 Israeli planes had been downed on the first day of fighting.<ref name=npr />\n\n=== Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula ===\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - conquest of Sinai 5-6 June.jpg|thumb|350px|Conquest of Sinai. 5\u20136 June 1967]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16401 Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|People in a bomb shelter at [[Kfar Maimon]]]]\n\nThe Egyptian forces consisted of seven [[division (military)|divisions]]: four [[Division (military)#Armored division|armoured]], two [[Division (military)#Armored division|infantry]], and one [[mechanized infantry]]. Overall, Egypt had around 100,000 troops and 900\u2013950 [[tank]]s in the Sinai, backed by 1,100 [[Armored personnel carrier|APCs]] and 1,000 [[artillery]] pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=59}} This arrangement was thought to be based on the Soviet doctrine, where mobile armour units at [[strategic depth]] provide a dynamic defense while infantry units engage in defensive battles.\n\nIsraeli forces concentrated on the border with Egypt included six armoured [[brigade]]s, one infantry brigade, one mechanized infantry brigade, three [[paratrooper]] brigades, giving a total of around 70,000 men and 700 tanks, who were organized in three armoured divisions. They had massed on the border the night before the war, camouflaging themselves and observing radio silence before being ordered to advance.\n\nThe Israeli plan was to surprise the Egyptian forces in both timing (the attack exactly coinciding with the IAF strike on Egyptian airfields), location (attacking via northern and central Sinai routes, as opposed to the Egyptian expectations of a repeat of the 1956 war, when the IDF attacked via the central and southern routes) and method (using a combined-force flanking approach, rather than direct tank assaults).\n\n==== Northern (El Arish) Israeli division ====\nOn 5 June, at 7:50&nbsp;a.m., the northernmost Israeli division, consisting of three brigades and commanded by Major General [[Israel Tal]], one of Israel's most prominent armour commanders, crossed the border at two points, opposite [[Nahal Oz]] and south of [[Khan Yunis]]. They advanced swiftly, holding fire to prolong the element of surprise. Tal's forces assaulted the \"Rafah Gap\", a seven-mile stretch containing the shortest of three main routes through the Sinai towards [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. The Egyptians had four divisions in the area, backed by minefields, pillboxes, underground bunkers, hidden gun emplacements and trenches. The terrain on either side of the route was impassable. The Israeli plan was to hit the Egyptians at selected key points with concentrated armour.<ref name=\"Oren178\" />\n\nTal's advance was led by the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Shmuel Gonen]]. The Israeli plan called for the 7th Brigade to outflank Khan Yunis from the north and the 60th Armored Brigade under Colonel Menachem Aviram would advance from the south. The two brigades would link up and surround Khan Yunis, while the paratroopers would take [[Rafah]]. Gonen entrusted the breakthrough to a single battalion of his brigade.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\">Oren, p. 180</ref>\n\nInitially, the advance was met with light resistance, as Egyptian intelligence had concluded that it was a diversion for the main attack. However, as Gonen's lead battalion advanced, it suddenly came under intense fire and took heavy losses. A second battalion was brought up, but was also pinned down. Meanwhile, the 60th Brigade became bogged down in the sand, while the paratroopers had trouble navigating through the dunes. The Israelis continued to press their attack, and despite heavy losses, cleared the Egyptian positions and reached the [[Khan Yunis]] railway junction in little over four hours.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\nGonen's brigade then advanced nine miles to Rafah in twin columns. Rafah itself was circumvented, and the Israelis attacked [[Sheikh Zuweid]], eight miles to the southwest, which was defended by two brigades. Though inferior in numbers and equipment, the Egyptians were deeply entrenched and camouflaged. The Israelis were pinned down by fierce Egyptian resistance, and called in air and artillery support to enable their lead elements to advance. Many Egyptians abandoned their positions after their commander and several of his staff were killed.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\nThe Israelis broke through with tank-led assaults. However, Aviram's forces misjudged the Egyptians' flank, and were pinned between strongholds before they were extracted after several hours. By nightfall, the Israelis had finished mopping up resistance. Israeli forces had taken significant losses, with Colonel Gonen later telling reporters that \"we left many of our dead soldiers in Rafah, and many burnt-out tanks.\" The Egyptians suffered some 2,000 casualties and lost 40 tanks.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 180\" />\n\n==== Advance on Arish ====\n[[File:6 Day War-Amos.jpg|thumb|Israeli reconnaissance forces from the \"Shaked\" unit in Sinai during the war.]]\n\nOn 5 June, with the road open, Israeli forces continued advancing towards [[Arish]]. Already by late afternoon, elements of the 79th Armored Battalion had charged through the seven-mile long Jiradi defile, a narrow pass defended by well-emplaced troops of the Egyptian 112th Infantry Brigade. In fierce fighting, which saw the pass change hands several times, the Israelis charged through the position. The Egyptians suffered heavy casualties and tank losses, while Israeli losses stood at 66 dead, 93 wounded and 28 tanks. Emerging at the western end, Israeli forces advanced to the outskirts of Arish.<ref>Oren, p. 181</ref> As it reached the outskirts of Arish, Tal's division also consolidated its hold on Rafah and Khan Yunis.\n\nThe following day, 6 June, the Israeli forces on the outskirts of Arish were reinforced by the 7th Brigade, which fought its way through the Jiradi pass. After receiving supplies via an airdrop, the Israelis entered the city and captured the airport at 7:50&nbsp;am. The Israelis entered the city at 8:00&nbsp;am. Company commander [[Yossi Peled]] recounted that \"Al-Arish was totally quiet, desolate. Suddenly, the city turned into a madhouse. Shots came at us from every alley, every corner, every window and house.\" An IDF record stated that \"clearing the city was hard fighting. The Egyptians fired from the rooftops, from balconies and windows. They dropped grenades into our half-tracks and blocked the streets with trucks. Our men threw the grenades back and crushed the trucks with their tanks.\"<ref name=\"Oren202\">Oren, p. 202</ref><ref name=\"iweapons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/six_day_war/SixDayWar.html|title=Six Day War|publisher=Israeli-weapons|accessdate=1 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206185516/http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/six_day_war/SixDayWar.html|archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gonen sent additional units to Arish, and the city was eventually taken.\n\nBrigadier-General [[Avraham Yoffe]]'s assignment was to penetrate Sinai south of Tal's forces and north of Sharon's. Yoffe's attack allowed Tal to complete the capture of the Jiradi defile, Khan Yunis. All of them were taken after fierce fighting. Gonen subsequently dispatched a force of tanks, infantry and engineers under Colonel Yisrael Granit to continue down the Mediterranean coast towards the [[Suez Canal]], while a second force led by Gonen himself turned south and captured Bir Lahfan and Jabal Libni.\n\n==== Mid-front (Abu-Ageila) Israeli division ====\n[[File:Sharon ageila.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Major General [[Ariel Sharon]] during the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Battle of Abu-Ageila]]]]\n\nFurther south, on 6 June, the Israeli 38th Armored Division under Major-General [[Ariel Sharon]] assaulted [[Um-Katef]], a heavily fortified area defended by the Egyptian [[2nd Infantry Division (Egypt)|2nd Infantry Division]] under Major-General Sa'adi Naguib (though Naguib was actially absent{{Citation needed|reason=Major General's absence neither referenced here, nor in [[2nd Infantry Division (Egypt)]] article. Recommend adding reference to both articles.|date=April 2020}}) and consisting of some 16,000 troops. The Egyptians also had a [[battalion]] of [[tank destroyer]]s and a tank regiment, formed of Soviet World War II armour, which included 90 [[T-34 tank|T-34-85]] tanks, 22 [[SU-100]] tank destroyers, and about 16,000 men. The Israelis had about 14,000 men and 150 post-World War II tanks including the [[AMX-13]], [[Centurion tank|Centurions]], and [[M50 Super Sherman]]s (modified [[M-4 Sherman]] tanks).\n\nTwo armoured brigades in the meantime, under Avraham Yoffe, slipped across the border through sandy wastes that Egypt had left undefended because they were considered impassable. Simultaneously, Sharon's tanks from the west were to engage Egyptian forces on Um-Katef ridge and block any reinforcements. Israeli infantry would clear the three trenches, while heliborne paratroopers would land behind Egyptian lines and silence their artillery. An armoured thrust would be made at al-Qusmaya to unnerve and isolate its garrison.\n\n[[File:AMX-13-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|Israeli Armor of the Six Day War: pictured here the [[AMX 13]]]]\nAs Sharon's division advanced into the Sinai, Egyptian forces staged successful delaying actions at Tarat Umm, Umm Tarfa, and Hill 181. An Israeli jet was downed by anti-aircraft fire, and Sharon's forces came under heavy shelling as they advanced from the north and west. The Israeli advance, which had to cope with extensive minefields, took a large number of casualties. A column of Israeli tanks managed to penetrate the northern flank of Abu Ageila, and by dusk, all units were in position. The Israelis then brought up ninety 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm artillery guns for a preparatory barrage, while civilian buses brought reserve infantrymen under Colonel [[Yekutiel Adam]] and helicopters arrived to ferry the paratroopers. These movements were unobserved by the Egyptians, who were preoccupied with Israeli probes against their perimeter.<ref>Oren, p. 182</ref>\n\nAs night fell, the Israeli assault troops lit flashlights, each battalion a different color, to prevent [[friendly fire]] incidents. At 10:00&nbsp;pm, Israeli artillery began a barrage on Um-Katef, firing some 6,000 shells in less than twenty minutes, the most concentrated artillery barrage in Israel's history.<ref>Simon Dunstan,[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESv1lwg537AC&pg=PT125 ''The Six Day War 1967: Sinai''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101175251/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESv1lwg537AC&pg=PT125 |date=1 January 2016 }}, Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 125</ref><ref>Leslie Stein,[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT181 ''The Making of Modern Israel: 1948\u20131967''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101175251/https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT181 |date=1 January 2016 }}, Polity Press, 2013 p. 181.</ref> Israeli tanks assaulted the northernmost Egyptian defenses and were largely successful, though an entire armoured brigade was stalled by mines, and had only one mine-clearance tank. Israeli infantrymen assaulted the triple line of trenches in the east. To the west, paratroopers commanded by Colonel [[Danny Matt]] landed behind Egyptian lines, though half the helicopters got lost and never found the battlefield, while others were unable to land due to mortar fire.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 201\">Oren, p. 201</ref><ref name=\"Hammel 1992, p. 239\">Hammel 1992, p.&nbsp;239</ref> Those that successfully landed on target destroyed Egyptian artillery and ammunition dumps and separated gun crews from their batteries, sowing enough confusion to significantly reduce Egyptian artillery fire. Egyptian reinforcements from Jabal Libni advanced towards Um-Katef to counterattack, but failed to reach their objective, being subjected to heavy air attacks and encountering Israeli lodgements on the roads. Egyptian commanders then called in artillery attacks on their own positions. The Israelis accomplished and sometimes exceeded their overall plan, and had largely succeeded by the following day. The Egyptians took heavy casualties, while the Israelis lost 40 dead and 140 wounded.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 201\" /><ref name=\"Hammel 1992, p. 239\" />\n\nYoffe's attack allowed Sharon to complete the capture of the Um-Katef, after fierce fighting. The main thrust at Um-Katef was stalled due to mines and craters. After IDF engineers had cleared a path by 4:00&nbsp;pm, Israeli and Egyptian tanks engaged in fierce combat, often at ranges as close as ten yards. The battle ended in an Israeli victory, with 40 Egyptian and 19 Israeli tanks destroyed. Meanwhile, Israeli infantry finished clearing out the Egyptian trenches, with Israeli casualties standing at 14 dead and 41 wounded and Egyptian casualties at 300 dead and 100 taken prisoner.<ref>Oren, p. 212</ref>\n\n==== Other Israeli forces ====\nFurther south, on 5 June, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], initially positioned as a ruse to draw off Egyptian forces from the real invasion routes, attacked the fortified bunkers at Kuntilla, a strategically valuable position whose capture would enable Mandler to block reinforcements from reaching Um-Katef and to join Sharon's upcoming attack on [[Nekhel|Nakhl]]. The defending Egyptian battalion, outnumbered and outgunned, fiercely resisted the attack, hitting a number of Israeli tanks. However, most of the defenders were killed, and only three Egyptian tanks, one of them damaged, survived. By nightfall, Mendler's forces had taken Kuntilla.<ref name=\"Oren202\" />\n\nWith the exceptions of Rafah and Khan Yunis, Israeli forces had initially avoided entering the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] had expressly forbidden entry into the area. After Palestinian positions in Gaza opened fire on the Negev settlements of [[Nirim]] and [[Kissufim]], IDF Chief of Staff [[Yitzhak Rabin]] overrode Dayan's instructions and ordered the 11th Mechanized Brigade under Colonel Yehuda Reshef to enter the Strip. The force was immediately met with heavy artillery fire and fierce resistance from Palestinian forces and remnants of the Egyptian forces from Rafah.\n\nBy sunset, the Israelis had taken the strategically vital Ali Muntar ridge, overlooking [[Gaza City]], but were beaten back from the city itself. Some 70 Israelis were killed, along with Israeli journalist Ben Oyserman and American journalist [[Paul Schutzer]]. Twelve members of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] were also killed. On the war's second day, 6 June, the Israelis were bolstered by the 35th Paratroopers Brigade under Colonel [[Rafael Eitan]], and took Gaza City along with the entire Strip. The fighting was fierce, and accounted for nearly half of all Israeli casualties on the southern front. However, Gaza rapidly fell to the Israelis.\n\nMeanwhile, on 6 June, two Israeli reserve brigades under Yoffe, each equipped with 100 tanks, penetrated the Sinai south of Tal's division and north of Sharon's, capturing the road junctions of Abu Ageila, Bir Lahfan, and Arish, taking all of them before midnight. Two Egyptian armoured brigades counterattacked, and a fierce battle took place until the following morning. The Egyptians were beaten back by fierce resistance coupled with airstrikes, sustaining heavy tank losses. They fled west towards Jabal Libni.<ref>Oren, p. 211</ref>\n\n==== The Egyptian Army ====\nDuring the ground fighting, remnants of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] attacked Israeli ground forces, but took losses from the Israeli Air Force and from Israeli anti-aircraft units. Throughout the last four days, Egyptian aircraft flew 150 sorties against Israeli units in the Sinai.\n\nMany of the Egyptian units remained intact and could have tried to prevent the Israelis from reaching the [[Suez Canal]], or engaged in combat in the attempt to reach the canal. However, when the Egyptian Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] heard about the fall of [[Abu-Ageila]], he panicked and ordered all units in the Sinai to retreat. This order effectively meant the defeat of Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], having learned of the results of the Israeli air strikes, decided together with Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer|Amer]] to order a general retreat from the Sinai within 24 hours. No detailed instructions were given concerning the manner and sequence of withdrawal.<ref name=\"ahram1\">{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2007/848/sc1.htm |title=The road to Naksa |work=Al-Ahram |author=Mubasher, Abdou |date=7\u201313 June 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524214942/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2007/848/sc1.htm |archive-date=24 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Next fighting days ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - conquest of Sinai 7-8 June.jpg|thumb|350px|Conquest of Sinai. 7\u20138 June 1967]]\n[[File:1967-06-06 Mid-East.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:56|Newsreel from 6 June about the first Israeli-Egyptian fighting.]]\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Israeli Gun Boat.jpg|thumb|An Israeli gunboat passes through the Straits of Tiran near Sharm El Sheikh.]]\nAs Egyptian columns retreated, Israeli aircraft and artillery attacked them. Israeli jets used [[napalm]] bombs during their sorties. The attacks destroyed hundreds of vehicles and caused heavy casualties. At Jabal Libni, retreating Egyptian soldiers were fired upon by their own artillery. At Bir Gafgafa, the Egyptians fiercely resisted advancing Israeli forces, knocking out three tanks and eight half-tracks, and killing 20 soldiers. Due to the Egyptians' retreat, the Israeli High Command decided not to pursue the Egyptian units but rather to bypass and destroy them in the mountainous passes of West Sinai.\n\nTherefore, in the following two days ( 6 and 7 June), all three Israeli divisions (Sharon and Tal were reinforced by an armoured brigade each) rushed westwards and reached the passes. Sharon's division first went southward then westward, via [[An-Nakhl Fortress|An-Nakhl]], to [[Mitla Pass]] with air support. It was joined there by parts of Yoffe's division, while its other units blocked the [[Gidi Pass]]. These passes became killing grounds for the Egyptians, who ran right into waiting Israeli positions and suffered heavy losses in both soldiers and vehicles. According to Egyptian diplomat [[Mahmoud Riad]], 10,000 men were killed in one day alone, and many others died from hunger and thirst. Tal's units stopped at various points to the length of the Suez Canal.\n\nIsrael's blocking action was partially successful. Only the Gidi pass was captured before the Egyptians approached it, but at other places, Egyptian units managed to pass through and cross the canal to safety. Due to the haste of the Egyptian retreat, soldiers often abandoned weapons, military equipment, and hundreds of vehicles. Many Egyptian soldiers were cut off from their units had to walk about 200 kilometers on foot before reaching the Suez Canal with limited supplies of food and water and were exposed to intense heat. Thousands of soldiers died as a result. Many Egyptian soldiers chose instead to surrender to the Israelis. However, the Israelis eventually exceeded their capabilities to provide for prisoners. As a result, they began directing soldiers towards the Suez Canal and only taking prisoner high-ranking officers, who were expected to be exchanged for captured Israeli pilots.\n\nAccording to some accounts, during the Egyptian retreat from the Sinai, a unit of [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Soviet Marines]] based on a Soviet warship in [[Port Said]] at the time came ashore and attempted to cross the Suez Canal eastward. The Soviet force was reportedly decimated by an Israeli air attack and lost 17 dead and 34 wounded. Among the wounded was the commander, Lt. Col. Victor Shevchenko.<ref name=ginor>Ginor, Isabella and Remez, Gideon: ''The Soviet-Israeli War, 1967\u20131973: The USSR's Military Intervention in the Egyptian-Israeli Conflict'', p. 23</ref>\n\nDuring the offensive, the [[Israeli Navy]] landed six [[frogman|combat divers]] from the [[Shayetet 13]] naval commando unit to infiltrate [[Alexandria]] harbour. The divers sank an Egyptian [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] before being taken prisoner. Shayetet 13 commandos also infiltrated into [[Port Said]] harbour, but found no ships there. A planned commando raid against the [[Syrian Navy]] never materialized. Both Egyptian and Israeli warships made movements at sea to intimidate the other side throughout the war, but did not engage each other. However, Israeli warships and aircraft did hunt for Egyptian submarines throughout the war.\n\nOn 7 June, Israel began the conquest of [[Sharm el-Sheikh]]. The [[Israeli Navy]] started the operation with a probe of Egyptian naval defenses. An aerial reconnaissance flight found that the area was less defended than originally thought. At about 4:30&nbsp;am, three Israeli [[missile boat]]s opened fire on Egyptian shore batteries, while paratroopers and commandos boarded helicopters and [[Nord Noratlas]] transport planes for an assault on Al-Tur, as Chief of Staff Rabin was convinced it was too risky to land them directly in Sharm el-Sheikh.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 248\">Oren, p. 248</ref> However, the city had been largely abandoned the day before, and reports from air and naval forces finally convinced Rabin to divert the aircraft to Sharm el-Sheikh. There, the Israelis engaged in a pitched battle with the Egyptians and took the city, killing 20 Egyptian soldiers and taking 8 prisoner. At 12:15&nbsp;pm, Defense Minister Dayan announced that the Straits of Tiran constituted an international waterway open to all ships without restriction.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 248\" />\n\nOn 8 June, Israel completed the capture of the Sinai by sending infantry units to [[Ras Sudar]] on the western coast of the peninsula.\n\nSeveral tactical elements made the swift Israeli advance possible: first, the surprise attack that quickly gave the [[Israeli Air Force]] complete air superiority over the [[Egyptian Air Force]]; second, the determined implementation of an innovative battle plan; third, the lack of coordination among Egyptian troops. These factors would prove to be decisive elements on Israel's other fronts as well.\n\n=== West Bank ===\n{{See also|Jordanian campaign (1967)}}\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - The Jordan salient.jpg|thumb|400px|The Jordan [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]], 5\u20137 June.]]\n\n====Egyptian-control of Jordanian forces====\nKing Hussein had given control of his army to Egypt in 1 June, on which date Egyptian General Riad arrived in [[Amman]] to take control of the Jordanian military.{{efn|Shlaim writes: \u201cTo understand Hussein\u2019s conduct during the June 1967 War it is essential to recall that he had handed over command of his army to Egypt under the terms of his pact with Nasser. On 1 June, General Riad arrived in Amman and assumed command of the Jordanian armed forces.\u201d<ref>Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 112</ref>}}\n\nEgyptian Field Marshal Amer used the [[Fog of war|confusion]] of the first hours of the conflict to send a cable to Amman that he was victorious; he claimed as evidence a radar sighting of a squadron of Israeli aircraft returning from bombing raids in Egypt, which he said was an Egyptian aircraft en route to attack Israel.<ref>Oren 2002, pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185.</ref> In this cable, sent shortly before 9:00am, Riad was ordered to attack.{{efn|On the initial Jordanian attack, Shlaim writes: \u201cThe cable was from First Vice-President and Deputy Supreme Commander Field Marshal Abd al-Hakim Amer. Amer was a nincompoop who largely owed his rapid promotion to his friendship with Nasser... He was inexperienced in military affairs, impulsive, and prone to wishful thinking... Amer\u2019s cable to Riad was a pack of lies... On the basis of these alleged successes, Amer ordered Riad to open a new front against the enemy and launch offensive operations. By the time Hussein arrived at the headquarters, Riad had already given the orders for the artillery to move to the front lines and bombard Israeli air bases and other targets; an infantry brigade to occupy the Israeli enclave on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem; the two Egyptian commando battalions to infiltrate enemy territory from the West Bank at dusk; and the air force to be put on combat alert and commence air strikes immediately. Although these decisions were made in his absence, Hussein made no attempt to cancel them or to delay the opening of fire until the information from Cairo could be checked. Jordan was thus committed to war by the decision of an Egyptian general who was acting on the orders of a serial blunderer in Cairo.\u201d<ref>Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 113</ref>}}\n\n====Initial attack====\nOne of the Jordanian brigades stationed in the [[West Bank]] was sent to the [[Hebron]] area in order to link with the Egyptians.\n\nThe IDF's strategic plan was to remain on the defensive along the Jordanian front, to enable focus in the expected campaign against Egypt.\n\nIntermittent machine-gun exchanges began taking place in Jerusalem at 9:30&nbsp;am, and the fighting gradually escalated as the Jordanians introduced mortar and recoilless rifle fire. Under the orders from General Narkis, the Israelis responded only with small-arms fire, firing in a flat trajectory to avoid hitting civilians, holy sites or the Old City. At 10:00&nbsp;am on 5 June, the [[Jordanian Army]] began shelling Israel. Two batteries of 155&nbsp;mm [[155 mm Long Tom|Long Tom]] cannons opened fire on the suburbs of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The commanders of these batteries were instructed to lay a two-hour barrage against military and civilian settlements in central Israel.

The Jordanians initially targeted [[kibbutz]] [[Ramat Rachel]] in the south and [[Mount Scopus]] in the north, then ranged into the city center and outlying neighborhoods. Military installations, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the [[Knesset]] compound were also targeted. Israeli civilian casualties totalled 20 dead and about 1,000 wounded. Some 900 buildings were damaged, including [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital]].<ref name=\"Oren, p. 185-187\">Oren, pp. 185\u201387</ref>\n\nAt 11:50&nbsp;am, sixteen Jordanian Hawker Hunters attacked [[Netanya]], [[Kfar Sirkin]] and [[Kfar Saba]], killing one civilian, wounding seven and destroying a transport plane. Three Iraqi Hawker Hunters strafed civilian settlements in the Jezreel Valley, and an Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-16]] attacked [[Afula]], and was shot down near the Megiddo airfield. The attack caused minimal material damage, hitting only a senior citizens' home and several chicken coops, but sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed, most of them when the Tupolev crashed.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 185-187\" />\n\n==== Israeli cabinet meets ====\nWhen the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] convened to decide what to do, [[Yigal Allon]] and [[Menahem Begin]] argued that this was an opportunity to take the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], but [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]] decided to defer any decision until [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] could be consulted.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\">Shlaim, 2001, p.&nbsp;244.</ref> [[Uzi Narkiss]] made a number of proposals for military action, including the capture of [[Latrun]], but the cabinet turned him down.\nDayan rejected multiple requests from Narkiss for permission to mount an infantry assault towards Mount Scopus.

The Hawker Hunters were refueling at the time of the attack. The Israeli aircraft attacked in two waves, the first of which cratered the runways and knocked out the control towers, and the second wave destroyed all 21 of Jordan's Hawker Hunter fighters, along with six transport aircraft and two helicopters. One Israeli jet was shot down by ground fire.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 187-188\" />\n\nIsraeli aircraft also attacked H-3, an [[Iraqi Air Force]] base in western Iraq. During the attack, 12 MiG-21s, 2 MiG-17s, 5 Hunter F6s, and 3 Il-28 bombers were destroyed or shot down. A [[Saiful Azam|Pakistani pilot stationed at the base]] shot down an Israeli fighter and a bomber during the raid. The Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli [[Fouga Magister]] jets attacked the Jordanian 40th Brigade with rockets as it moved south from the [[Damia Bridge|Damiya Bridge]]. Dozens of tanks were knocked out, and a convoy of 26 trucks carrying ammunition was destroyed. In Jerusalem, Israel responded to Jordanian shelling with a missile strike that devastated Jordanian positions. The Israelis used the L missile, a [[surface-to-surface]] missile developed jointly with [[France]] in secret.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 187-188\" />\n\n==== Jordanian battalion at Government House ====\n{{Further|Battle of Ammunition Hill}}\nA Jordanian battalion advanced up Government House ridge and dug in at the perimeter of Government House, the headquarters of the United Nations observers,<ref name=\"UNISPAL1347\">{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |title=United Nations June 5, 1967 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226202011/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>Oren, p. 187</ref><ref name=\"Shlaim p245\">Shlaim 2001, p.&nbsp;245.</ref> and opened fire on Ramat Rachel, the Allenby Barracks and the Jewish section of [[Abu Tor]] with mortars and recoilless rifles. UN observers fiercely protested the incursion into the neutral zone, and several manhandled a Jordanian machine gun out of Government House after the crew had set it up in a second-floor window. After the Jordanians occupied [[Jabel Mukaber]], an advance patrol was sent out and approached Ramat Rachel, where they came under fire from four civilians, including the wife of the director, who were armed with old Czech-made weapons.<ref>Oren, p. 188\u201389</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificamilitary.com/books/f-sixDaysInJune.html |title=Pacifica Military History \u2013 Free Samples |publisher=Pacificamilitary.com |date=5 June 1967 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308234307/http://www.pacificamilitary.com/books/f-sixDaysInJune.html |archive-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010036.JPG|thumb|Israeli paratroopers flush out Jordanian soldiers from trenches during the [[Battle of Ammunition Hill]].]]\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010039.JPG|thumb|Silhouette of Israeli paratroops advancing on Ammunition Hill.]]\nThe immediate Israeli response was an offensive to retake Government House and its ridge. The Jerusalem Brigade's Reserve Battalion 161, under Lieutenant-Colonel Asher Dreizin, was given the task. Dreizin had two infantry companies and eight tanks under his command, several of which broke down or became stuck in the mud at Ramat Rachel, leaving three for the assault. The Jordanians mounted fierce resistance, knocking out two tanks.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 191-192\">Oren, pp. 191\u201392</ref>\n\nThe Israelis broke through the compound's western gate and began clearing the building with grenades, before General [[Odd Bull]], commander of the UN observers, compelled the Israelis to hold their fire, telling them that the Jordanians had already fled. The Israelis proceeded to take the Antenna Hill, directly behind Government House, and clear out a series of bunkers to the west and south. The fighting, often conducted hand-to-hand, continued for nearly four hours before the surviving Jordanians fell back to trenches held by the Hittin Brigade, which were steadily overwhelmed. By 6:30&nbsp;pm, the Jordanians had retreated to [[Bethlehem]], having suffered about 100 casualties. All but ten of Dreizin's soldiers were casualties, and Dreizin himself was wounded three times.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 191-192\" />\n\n==== Israeli invasion ====\nDuring the late afternoon of 5 June, the Israelis launched an offensive to [[Six-Day War#West_Bank|encircle Jerusalem]], which lasted into the following day. During the night, they were supported by intense tank, artillery and mortar fire to soften up Jordanian positions. Searchlights placed atop the Labor Federation building, then the tallest in Israeli Jerusalem, exposed and blinded the Jordanians. The Jerusalem Brigade moved south of Jerusalem, while the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] and [[55th Paratroopers Brigade]] under [[Mordechai Gur]] encircled it from the north.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\">Oren, p. 222</ref>\n\nA combined force of tanks and paratroopers crossed no-man's land near the [[Mandelbaum Gate]]. One of Gur's paratroop battalions approached the fortified Police Academy. The Israelis used [[bangalore torpedo]]es to blast their way through barbed wire leading up to the position while exposed and under heavy fire. With the aid of two tanks borrowed from the Jerusalem Brigade, they captured the Police Academy. After receiving reinforcements, they moved up to attack [[Ammunition hill|Ammunition Hill]].<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\">http://www.sixdaywar.org/contest/easternfront.asp{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Jordanian defenders, who were heavily dug-in, fiercely resisted the attack. All of the Israeli officers except for two company commanders were killed, and the fighting was mostly led by individual soldiers. The fighting was conducted at close quarters in trenches and bunkers, and was often hand-to-hand. The Israelis captured the position after four hours of heavy fighting. During the battle, 36 Israeli and 71 Jordanian soldiers were killed.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\" />\n\nThe battalion subsequently drove east, and linked up with the Israeli enclave on [[Mount Scopus]] and its [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] campus. Gur's other battalions captured the other Jordanian positions around the [[American Colony, Jerusalem|American Colony]], despite being short on men and equipment and having come under a Jordanian mortar bombardment while waiting for the signal to advance.<ref name=\"Oren, p.222\" /><ref name=\"Jordanian Front\" />\n\nAt the same time, the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] attacked the fortress at [[Latrun]], which the Jordanians had abandoned due to heavy Israeli tank fire. The brigade attacked [[Har Adar]], but seven tanks were knocked out by mines, forcing the infantry to mount an assault without armoured cover. The Israeli soldiers advanced under heavy fire, jumping between stones to avoid mines. The fighting was conducted at close-quarters, often with knives and bayonets.\n\nThe Jordanians fell back after a battle that left two Israeli and eight Jordanian soldiers dead, and Israeli forces advanced through [[Beth-Horon|Beit Horon]] towards [[Ramallah]], taking four fortified villages along the way. By the evening, the brigade arrived in Ramallah. Meanwhile, the 163rd Infantry Battalion secured [[Abu Tor]] following a fierce battle, severing the Old City from Bethlehem and Hebron.\n\nMeanwhile, 600 Egyptian commandos stationed in the West Bank moved to attack Israeli airfields. Led by Jordanian intelligence scouts, they crossed the border and began infiltrating through Israeli settlements towards [[Ramla]] and [[Hatzor]]. They were soon detected and sought shelter in nearby fields, which the Israelis set on fire. Some 450 commandos were killed, and the remainder escaped to Jordan.<ref name=\"Oren203\">Oren, p. 203</ref>\n\nFrom the American Colony, the paratroopers moved towards the Old City. Their plan was to approach it via the lightly defended Salah al-Din Street. However, they made a wrong turn onto the heavily defended Nablus Road. The Israelis ran into fierce resistance. Their tanks fired at point-blank range down the street, while the paratroopers mounted repeated charges. Despite repelling repeated Israeli charges, the Jordanians gradually gave way to Israeli firepower and momentum. The Israelis suffered some 30 casualties \u2013 half the original force \u2013 while the Jordanians lost 45 dead and 142 wounded.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 222-223\">Oren, pp. 222\u201323</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli 71st Battalion breached barbed wire and minefields and emerged near Wadi Joz, near the base of Mount Scopus, from where the Old City could be cut off from Jericho and East Jerusalem from Ramallah. Israeli artillery targeted the one remaining route from Jerusalem to the West Bank, and shellfire deterred the Jordanians from counterattacking from their positions at Augusta-Victoria. An Israeli detachment then captured the [[Rockefeller Museum]] after a brief skirmish.<ref name=\"Oren, p. 222-223\" />\n\nAfterwards, the Israelis broke through to the Jerusalem-Ramallah road. At Tel al-Ful, the Israelis fought a running battle with up to thirty Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians stalled the advance and destroyed a number of half-tracks, but the Israelis launched air attacks and exploited the vulnerability of the external fuel tanks mounted on the Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians lost half their tanks, and retreated towards [[Jericho]]. Joining up with the 4th Brigade, the Israelis then descended through [[Shuafat]] and the site of what is now [[French Hill]], through Jordanian defenses at Mivtar, emerging at Ammunition Hill.<ref>Oren, p. 224</ref>\n\n[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010035.JPG|thumb|An Israeli airstrike near the Augusta-Victoria Hospital]]\nWith Jordanian defenses in Jerusalem crumbling, elements of the Jordanian 60th Brigade and an infantry battalion were sent from Jericho to reinforce Jerusalem. Its original orders were to repel the Israelis from the Latrun corridor, but due to the worsening situation in Jerusalem, the brigade was ordered to proceed to Jerusalem's Arab suburbs and attack [[Mount Scopus]]. Parallel to the brigade were infantrymen from the Imam Ali Brigade, who were approaching [[Al-Issawiya|Issawiya]]. The brigades were spotted by Israeli aircraft and decimated by rocket and cannon fire. Other Jordanian attempts to reinforce Jerusalem were beaten back, either by armoured ambushes or airstrikes.\n\nFearing damage to holy sites and the prospect of having to fight in built-up areas, Dayan ordered his troops not to enter the Old City.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\" /> He also feared that Israel would be subjected to a fierce international backlash and the outrage of Christians worldwide if it forced its way into the Old City. Privately, he told [[David Ben-Gurion]] that he was also concerned over the prospect of Israel capturing Jerusalem's holy sites, only to be forced to give them up under the threat of international sanctions.\n\n==== The West Bank ====\nIsrael was to gain almost total control of the West Bank by the evening of 7 June,{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}} and began its [[military occupation]] of the West Bank on that day, issuing a military order, the \"Proclamation Regarding Law and Administration (The West Bank Area) (No. 2)\u20141967\", which established the military government in the West Bank and granted the commander of the area full legislative, executive, and judicial power.<ref name=\"Weill2014\">{{citation|author=Sharon Weill|title=The Role of National Courts in Applying International Humanitarian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDnnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA19|date=February 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968542-4|page=19}}</ref><ref name=weill2007 /> Jordan had realised that it had no hope of defence as early as the morning of 6 June, just a day after the conflict had begun.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138-139}} At Nasser's request, Egypt's [[Abdul Munim Riad]] sent a situation update at midday on 6 June:{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}}\n<blockquote>The situation on the West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. A concentrated attack has been launched on all axes, together with heavy fire, day and night. Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi air forces in position H3 have been virtually destroyed. Upon consultation with King Hussein I have been asked to convey to you the following choices:\n:1. A political decision to cease fighting to be imposed by a third party (the USA, the Soviet Union or the Security Council).\n:2. To vacate the West Bank tonight.\n:3. To go on fighting for one more day, resulting in the isolation and destruction of the entire Jordanian Army.\nKing Hussein has asked me to refer this matter to you for an immediate reply.\"</blockquote>\n\nAn Egyptian order for Jordanian forces to withdraw across the Jordan River was issued at 10am on June 6; however that afternoon King Hussein learned of the impending [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 233]] and decided instead to hold out in the hope that a ceasefire would be implemented soon. It was already too late, as the counter-order caused confusion and in many cases it was not possible to regain positions which had previously been left.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=139}}\n\nOn 7 June, Dayan had ordered his troops not to enter the Old City; however, upon hearing that the UN was about to declare a ceasefire, he changed his mind, and without cabinet clearance, decided to capture it.<ref name=\"Shlaim p244\" /> Two paratroop battalions attacked Augusta-Victoria Hill, high ground overlooking the Old City from the east. One battalion attacked from Mount Scopus, and another attacked from the valley between it and the Old City. Another paratroop battalion, personally led by Gur, broke into the Old City, and was joined by the other two battalions after their missions were complete. The paratroopers met little resistance. The fighting was conducted solely by the paratroopers; the Israelis did not use armour during the battle out of fear of severe damage to the Old City.\n\nIn the north, one battalion from Peled's division was sent to check Jordanian defenses in the Jordan Valley. A brigade belonging to Peled's division captured the western part of the West Bank. One brigade attacked Jordanian artillery positions around [[Jenin]], which were shelling [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The Jordanian 12th Armored Battalion, which outnumbered the Israelis, held off repeated attempts to capture Jenin. However, Israeli air attacks took their toll, and the Jordanian [[M48 Patton]]s, with their external fuel tanks, proved vulnerable at short distances, even to the Israeli-modified Shermans. Twelve Jordanian tanks were destroyed, and only six remained operational.<ref name=\"Oren203\" />\n\n[[File:Soldiers Western Wall 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[David Rubinger]]'s famed photograph of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] paratroopers at [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]] shortly after its capture. From left to right: Zion Karasenti, Yitzhak Yifat, and Haim Oshri.{{ref label|reference_name_A|a|none}}]]\nJust after dusk, Israeli reinforcements arrived. The Jordanians continued to fiercely resist, and the Israelis were unable to advance without artillery and air support. One Israeli jet attacked the Jordanian commander's tank, wounding him and killing his radio operator and intelligence officer. The surviving Jordanian forces then withdrew to Jenin, where they were reinforced by the 25th Infantry Brigade. The Jordanians were effectively surrounded in Jenin.<ref name=\"Oren203\" />\n\nJordanian infantry and their three remaining tanks managed to hold off the Israelis until 4:00&nbsp;am, when three battalions arrived to reinforce them in the afternoon. The Jordanian tanks charged, and knocked out multiple Israeli vehicles, and the tide began to shift. After sunrise, Israeli jets and artillery conducted a two-hour bombardment against the Jordanians. The Jordanians lost 10 dead and 250 wounded, and had only seven tanks left, including two without gas, and sixteen APCs. The Israelis then fought their way into Jenin, and captured the city after fierce fighting.<ref>Oren, p. 219</ref>\n\nAfter the Old City fell, the Jerusalem Brigade reinforced the paratroopers, and continued to the south, capturing [[Judea]] and [[Gush Etzion]]. [[Hebron]] was taken without any resistance. Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the [[1929 Hebron massacre|1929 massacre]] of the city's Jewish community, Hebron's residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops, and voluntarily gave up their weapons. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Harel Brigade proceeded eastward, descending to the [[Jordan River]].\n\nOn 7 June, Israeli forces seized [[Bethlehem]], taking the city after a brief battle that left some 40 Jordanian soldiers dead, with the remainder fleeing. On the same day, one of Peled's brigades seized [[Nablus]]; then it joined one of Central Command's armoured brigades to fight the Jordanian forces; as the Jordanians held the advantage of superior equipment and were equal in numbers to the Israelis.\n\nAgain, the air superiority of the IAF proved paramount as it immobilized the Jordanians, leading to their defeat. One of Peled's brigades joined with its Central Command counterparts coming from Ramallah, and the remaining two blocked the Jordan river crossings together with the Central Command's 10th. [[Combat Engineering Corps|Engineering Corps]] sappers blew up the Abdullah and Hussein bridges with captured Jordanian mortar shells, while elements of the Harel Brigade crossed the river and occupied positions along the east bank to cover them, but quickly pulled back due to American pressure. The Jordanians, anticipating an Israeli offensive deep into Jordan, assembled the remnants of their army and Iraqi units in Jordan to protect the western approaches to [[Amman]] and the southern slopes of the [[Golan Heights]].\n\nAs Israel continued its offensive on 7 June, taking no account of the UN ceasefire resolution, the Egyptian-Jordanian command ordered a full Jordanian withdrawal for the second time, in order to avoid an annihilation of the Jordanian army.<ref name=Mutawi140>{{harvnb|Mutawi|2002|p=140}}: \"Shortly after the order for the withdrawal had been issued [10.00 a.m. on 6 June], the Jordanians were informed that the UN Security Council was meeting to consider a resolution for an unconditional ceasefire. On learning of this the Jordanian command decided that the order for withdrawal had been premature, since if a ceasefire went into effect that day they would still be in possession of the West Bank. Consequently, the order was countermanded and those forces which had already withdrawn were asked to return to their original positions... The Security Council ceasefire resolution was passed unanimously at 11.00 p.m. on 6 June. However, Jordan's hope that this would enable it to hold the West Bank was destroyed when Israel continued its offensive. On learning of this Riad once again ordered a complete withdrawal from the West Bank as he feared that failure to do so would result in the annihilation of the remains of the Jordanian Army. By nightfall on 7 June most elements of the army had withdrawn to the East Bank and by mid-day on 8 June Jordan was once again the Transjordan of King Abdullah, while Israel completed total occupation of historical Palestine.\"</ref> This was complete by nightfall on 7 June.<ref name=Mutawi140/>\n\nAfter the Old City was captured, Dayan told his troops to \"dig in\" to hold it. When an armoured brigade commander entered the West Bank on his own initiative, and stated that he could see [[Jericho]], Dayan ordered him back. It was only after intelligence reports indicated that Hussein had withdrawn his forces across the Jordan River that Dayan ordered his troops to capture the West Bank.<ref name=\"Shlaim p245\" /> According to Narkis:\n\n<blockquote>First, the Israeli government had no intention of capturing the West Bank. On the contrary, it was opposed to it. Second, there was not any provocation on the part of the IDF. Third, the rein was only loosened when a real threat to Jerusalem's security emerged. This is truly how things happened on June 5, although it is difficult to believe. The end result was something that no one had planned.<ref>Shlaim 2001, p.&nbsp;246.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Golan Heights ===\n[[File:1967 Six Day War - Battle of Golan Heights.svg|thumb|400px|The Battle of Golan Heights, 9\u201310 June.]]\n\nIn May\u2013June 1967, in preparation for conflict, the Israeli government planned to confine the confrontation to the Egyptian front, whilst taking into account the possibility of some fighting on the Syrian front.<ref name=\"Shlaim2000p243\" />\n\n==== Syrian front 5\u20138 June ====\nSyria largely stayed out of the conflict for the first four days.<ref name=Shlaim9293>Shlaim; Louis (2012) pp. 92\u201393: \"Except for some sporadic Syrian shelling of Israeli settlements along the border, Syria stayed pretty much out of the war for the first four days... the Syrians were confused by what they slowly learned was the scale of the destruction on the Egyptian front.

The Syrian aircraft that survived the attack retreated to distant bases and played no further role in the war. Following the attack, Syria realised that the news it had received from Egypt of the near-total destruction of the Israeli military could not have been true.<ref name=\"Knopf642\" />\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7250 Kids in the shelter kibbutz Dan.JPG|thumb|People in a bomb shelter at [[Dan, Israel|Kibbutz Dan]]]]\nOn June 6, a minor Syrian force tried to capture the water plants at [[Tel Dan]] (the subject of a fierce escalation two years earlier), [[Dan, Israel|Dan]], and [[She'ar Yashuv]]. These attacks were repulsed with the loss of twenty soldiers and seven tanks. An Israeli officer was also killed. But a broader Syrian offensive quickly failed. Syrian reserve units were broken up by Israeli air attacks, and several tanks were reported to have sunk in the Jordan River.<ref name=\"Knopf642\" />\n\nOther problems included tanks being too wide for bridges, lack of radio communications between tanks and infantry, and units ignoring orders to advance. A post-war Syrian army report concluded:\n\n<blockquote>Our forces did not go on the offensive either because they did not arrive or were not wholly prepared or because they could not find shelter from the enemy's planes.

The Syrian bombardment killed two civilians, hit 205 houses as well as farming installations.

Syria had supported pre-war raids that had helped raise tensions and had routinely shelled Israel from the Heights, so some Israeli leaders wanted to see Syria punished.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"The War: Day Five, June 9\".</ref> Military opinion was that the attack would be extremely costly, since it would entail an uphill battle against a strongly fortified enemy. The western side of the Golan Heights consists of a rock escarpment that rises 500 meters (1,700&nbsp;ft) from the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]], and then flattens to a gently sloping plateau. Dayan opposed the operation bitterly at first, believing such an undertaking would result in losses of 30,000 and might trigger Soviet intervention. Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]], on the other hand, was more open to the possibility, as was the head of the Northern Command, [[David Elazar]], whose unbridled enthusiasm for and confidence in the operation may have eroded Dayan's reluctance.\n\nEventually, the situation on the Southern and Central fronts cleared up, intelligence estimated that the likelihood of Soviet intervention had been reduced, [[reconnaissance]] showed some Syrian defenses in the Golan region collapsing, and an intercepted cable revealed that Nasser was urging the President of Syria to immediately accept a cease-fire. At 3&nbsp;am on 9 June, Syria announced its acceptance of the cease-fire. Despite this announcement, Dayan became more enthusiastic about the idea and four hours later at 7&nbsp;am, \"gave the order to go into action against Syria\"{{ref label|reference_name_H1|i|none}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> without consultation or government authorisation.<ref>Morris, 2001, p. 325</ref>\n\nThe Syrian army consisted of about 75,000 men grouped in nine brigades, supported by an adequate amount of artillery and armour. Israeli forces used in combat consisted of two brigades (the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] and the [[Golani Brigade]]) in the northern part of the front at [[Givat HaEm]], and another two (infantry and one of Peled's brigades summoned from Jenin) in the center. The Golan Heights' unique terrain (mountainous slopes crossed by parallel streams every several kilometers running east to west), and the general lack of roads in the area channeled both forces along east-west axes of movement and restricted the ability of units to support those on either flank. Thus the Syrians could move north-south on the plateau itself, and the Israelis could move north-south at the base of the Golan escarpment. An advantage Israel possessed was the excellent intelligence collected by [[Mossad]] operative [[Eli Cohen]] (who was captured and executed in Syria in 1965) regarding the Syrian battle positions. Syria had built extensive defensive fortifications in depths up to 15 kilometers,<ref>Hammel 1992, p.&nbsp;387</ref> comparable to the [[Maginot Line]].\n\nAs opposed to all the other campaigns, IAF was only partially effective in the Golan because the fixed fortifications were so effective. However, the Syrian forces proved unable to put up effective defense largely because the officers were poor leaders and treated their soldiers badly; often officers would retreat from danger, leaving their men confused and ineffective. The Israelis also had the upper hand during close combat that took place in the numerous Syrian bunkers along the Golan Heights, as they were armed with the [[Uzi]], a [[submachine gun]] designed for close combat, while Syrian soldiers were armed with the heavier [[AK-47]] assault rifle, designed for combat in more open areas.\n\n==== Israeli attack: first day (9 June)====\n[[File:Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967. D327-098.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967]]\nOn the morning of 9 June, Israeli jets began carrying out dozens of sorties against Syrian positions from Mount Hermon to Tawfiq, using rockets salvaged from captured Egyptian stocks. The airstrikes knocked out artillery batteries and storehouses and forced transport columns off the roads. The Syrians suffered heavy casualties and a drop in morale, with a number of senior officers and troops deserting. The attacks also provided time as Israeli forces cleared paths through Syrian minefields. However, the airstrikes did not seriously damage the Syrians' bunkers and trench systems, and the bulk of Syrian forces on the Golan remained in their positions.<ref>Oren, p.280</ref>\n\nAbout two hours after the airstrikes began, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]], led by Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], advanced into the Golan Heights from [[Givat HaEm]]. Its advance was spearheaded by [[Engineering Corps (Israel)|Engineering Corps]] sappers and eight bulldozers, which cleared away barbed wire and mines. As they advanced, the force came under fire, and five bulldozers were immediately hit. The Israeli tanks, with their maneuverability sharply reduced by the terrain, advanced slowly under fire toward the fortified village of Sir al-Dib, with their ultimate objective being the fortress at Qala. Israeli casualties steadily mounted. Part of the attacking force lost its way and emerged opposite Za'ura, a redoubt manned by Syrian reservists. With the situation critical, Colonel Mandler ordered simultaneous assaults on Za'ura and Qala. Heavy and confused fighting followed, with Israeli and Syrian tanks struggling around obstacles and firing at extremely short ranges. Mandler recalled that \"the Syrians fought well and bloodied us. We beat them only by crushing them under our treads and by blasting them with our cannons at very short range, from 100 to 500 meters.\" The first three Israeli tanks to enter Qala were stopped by a Syrian bazooka team, and a relief column of seven Syrian tanks arrived to repel the attackers. The Israelis took heavy fire from the houses, but could not turn back, as other forces were advancing behind them, and they were on a narrow path with mines on either side. The Israelis continued pressing forward, and called for air support. A pair of Israeli jets destroyed two of the Syrian tanks, and the remainder withdrew. The surviving defenders of Qala retreated after their commander was killed. Meanwhile, Za'ura fell in an Israeli assault, and the Israelis also captured the 'Ein Fit fortress.<ref>Oren, pp. 281\u201382</ref>\n\nIn the central sector, the Israeli 181st Battalion captured the strongholds of Dardara and Tel Hillal after fierce fighting. Desperate fighting also broke out along the operation's northern axis, where [[Golani Brigade]] attacked thirteen Syrian positions, including the formidable Tel Fakhr position. Navigational errors placed the Israelis directly under the Syrians' guns. In the fighting that followed, both sides took heavy casualties, with the Israelis losing all nineteen of their tanks and half-tracks.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\">Oren, p. 283</ref> The Israeli battalion commander then ordered his twenty-five remaining men to dismount, divide into two groups, and charge the northern and southern flanks of Tel Fakhr. The first Israelis to reach the perimeter of the southern approach laid bodily down on the barbed wire, allowing their comrades to vault over them. From there, they assaulted the fortified Syrian positions. The fighting was waged at extremely close quarters, often hand-to-hand.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\" />\n\nOn the northern flank, the Israelis broke through within minutes and cleared out the trenches and bunkers. During the seven-hour battle, the Israelis lost 31 dead and 82 wounded, while the Syrians lost 62 dead and 20 captured. Among the dead was the Israeli battalion commander. The Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion took Tel 'Azzaziat, and Darbashiya also fell to Israeli forces.<ref name=\"Oren, pp. 283\u2013283\" />\n\n[[File:1967-06-09 Egypt Accepts UN Cease-Fire.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1:16|[[Universal Newsreel]] from 9 June about the war and UN reactions.]]\nBy the evening of 9 June, the four Israeli brigades had all broken through to the plateau, where they could be reinforced and replaced. Thousands of reinforcements began reaching the front, those tanks and half-tracks that had survived the previous day's fighting were refueled and replenished with ammunition, and the wounded were evacuated. By dawn, the Israelis had eight brigades in the sector.\n\nSyria's first line of defense had been shattered, but the defenses beyond that remained largely intact. Mount Hermon and the Banias in the north, and the entire sector between Tawfiq and Customs House Road in the south remained in Syrian hands. In a meeting early on the night of 9 June, Syrian leaders decided to reinforce those positions as quickly as possible, and to maintain a steady barrage on Israeli civilian settlements.\n\n==== Israeli attack: the next day (10 June)====\nThroughout the night, the Israelis continued their advance. Though it was slowed by fierce resistance, an anticipated Syrian counterattack never materialized. At the fortified village of Jalabina, a garrison of Syrian reservists, leveling their anti-aircraft guns, held off the Israeli 65th Paratroop Battalion for four hours before a small detachment managed to penetrate the village and knock out the heavy guns.\n\nMeanwhile, the 8th Brigade's tanks moved south from Qala, advancing six miles to Wasit under heavy artillery and tank bombardment. At the Banias in the north, Syrian mortar batteries opened fire on advancing Israeli forces only after Golani Brigade sappers cleared a path through a minefield, killing sixteen Israeli soldiers and wounding four.\n\nOn the next day, 10 June, the central and northern groups joined in a [[pincer movement]] on the plateau, but that fell mainly on empty territory as the Syrian forces retreated. At 8:30&nbsp;am, the Syrians began blowing up their own bunkers, burning documents and retreating. Several units joined by Elad Peled's troops climbed to the Golan from the south, only to find the positions mostly empty. When the 8th Brigade reached Mansura, five miles from Wasit, the Israelis met no opposition and found abandoned equipment, including tanks, in perfect working condition. In the fortified Banias village, Golani Brigade troops found only several Syrian soldiers chained to their positions.<ref>Oren, p. 295</ref>\n\nDuring the day, the Israeli units stopped after obtaining manoeuvre room between their positions and a line of volcanic hills to the west. In some locations, Israeli troops advanced after an agreed-upon cease-fire<ref>{{cite video|year=1960|title=Video: Cease-Fire.

Israel's strategic depth grew to at least 300 kilometers in the south, 60 kilometers in the east, and 20 kilometers of extremely rugged terrain in the north, a security asset that would prove useful in the [[Yom Kippur War]] six years later.\n\nSpeaking three weeks after the war ended, as he accepted an honorary degree from Hebrew University, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] gave his reasoning behind the success of Israel:\n\n:Our airmen, who struck the enemies' planes so accurately that no one in the world understands how it was done and people seek technological explanations or secret weapons; our armoured troops who beat the enemy even when their equipment was inferior to his; our soldiers in all other branches \u2026 who overcame our enemies everywhere, despite the latter's superior numbers and fortifications\u2014all these revealed not only coolness and courage in the battle but \u2026 an understanding that only their personal stand against the greatest dangers would achieve victory for their country and for their families, and that if victory was not theirs the alternative was annihilation.<ref>Sachar 1976. p.&nbsp;660.</ref>\n\nIn recognition of contributions, Rabin was given the honour of naming the war for the Israelis. From the suggestions proposed, including the \"War of Daring\", \"War of Salvation\", and \"War of the Sons of Light\", he \"chose the least ostentatious, the Six-Day War, evoking the days of creation\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section \"Aftershocks\".</ref>\n\nDayan's final report on the war to the Israeli general staff listed several shortcomings in Israel's actions, including misinterpretation of Nasser's intentions, overdependence on the United States, and reluctance to act when Egypt closed the Straits. He also credited several factors for Israel's success: Egypt did not appreciate the advantage of striking first and their adversaries did not accurately gauge Israel's strength and its willingness to use it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn Egypt, according to [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal|Heikal]], Nasser had admitted his responsibility for the military defeat in June 1967.<ref name=\"PodehWinckler2004p110\" /> According to historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan, Nasser's mistaken decisions to expel the international peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and close the Straits of Tiran in 1967 led to a state of war with Israel, despite Egypt's lack of military preparedness.<ref name=\"PodehWinckler2004p105\" />\n\nAfter the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Egypt reviewed the causes of its loss of the 1967 war. Issues that were identified included \"the individualistic bureaucratic leadership\"; \"promotions on the basis of loyalty, not expertise, and the army's fear of telling Nasser the truth\"; lack of intelligence; and better Israeli weapons, command, organization, and will to fight.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Casualties ===\n{{See also|Israeli casualties of war}}\nBetween 776<ref name=\"Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs\">Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2008.</ref> and 983 Israelis were killed and 4,517 were wounded.

The vast majority of the populations in both territories declined to take citizenship. See also [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and [[Golan Heights]].\n\nIn his book ''Righteous Victims'' (1999), Israeli \"[[New Historian]]\" [[Benny Morris]] writes:\n{{quote|In three villages southwest of Jerusalem and at Qalqilya, houses were destroyed \"not in battle, but as punishment ... and in order to chase away the inhabitants ... contrary to government ... policy,\" Dayan wrote in his memoirs. In Qalqilya, about a third of the homes were razed and about 12,000 inhabitants were evicted, though many then camped out in the environs. The evictees in both areas were allowed to stay and later were given cement and tools by the Israeli authorities to rebuild at least some of their dwellings.\n\nBut many thousands of other Palestinians now took to the roads. Perhaps as many as seventy thousand, mostly from the Jericho area, fled during the fighting; tens of thousands more left over the following months. Altogether, about one-quarter of the population of the West Bank, about 200\u2013250,000 people, went into exile. ... They simply walked to the Jordan River crossings and made their way on foot to the East Bank. It is unclear how many were intimidated or forced out by the Israeli troops and how many left voluntarily, in panic and fear. There is some evidence of IDF soldiers going around with loudspeakers ordering West Bankers to leave their homes and cross the Jordan. Some left because they had relatives or sources of livelihood on the East Bank and feared being permanently cut off.\n\nThousands of Arabs were taken by bus from East Jerusalem to the [[Allenby Bridge]], though there is no evidence of coercion. The free Israeli-organized transportation, which began on June 11, 1967, went on for about a month. At the bridge they had to sign a document stating that they were leaving of their own free will. Perhaps as many as 70,000 people emigrated from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.\n\nOn July 2, the Israeli government announced that it would allow the return of those 1967 refugees who desired to do so, but no later than August 10, later extended to September 13. The Jordanian authorities probably pressured many of the refugees, who constituted an enormous burden, to sign up to return.

However, the position of the other [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] has been a long-standing and bitter cause of conflict for decades between Israel and the Palestinians, and the Arab world in general. Jordan and Egypt eventually withdrew their claims to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, respectively. Israel and Jordan signed a [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty in 1994]].\n\nAfter the Israeli occupation of these territories, the [[Gush Emunim]] movement launched a [[Israeli settlement|large settlement effort]] in these areas to secure a permanent foothold. There are now hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in the West Bank. They are a matter of controversy within Israel, both among the general population and within different political administrations, supporting them to varying degrees. Palestinians consider them a provocation. The Israeli settlements in Gaza were evacuated in August 2005 as a part of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel's disengagement from Gaza]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abba Eban]], Israeli Foreign Minister\n* [[Hafez al-Assad]], Syrian Defense Minister\n* ''[[Catch 67]]'', a 2017 Israeli philosophy book on the West Bank occupation that launched a public dialogue on the war's 50th anniversary\n* [[Israeli MIAs]]\n* [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Soviet leader\n* [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East]]\n* [[Robert McNamara]], U.S. Defense Secretary\n* [[Syrian towns and villages depopulated in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]\n* [[U Thant]], Secretary General of the United Nations\n\n== Notes ==\n1. {{note label|reference_name_A|a|none|&nbsp;Photograph:}}\n:It was twenty minutes after the capture of the Western Wall that [[David Rubinger]] shot his \"signature\" photograph of three Israeli paratroopers gazing in wonder up at the wall [{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0003/arm01.htm |title=June 10, 1967 \u2013 Israeli paratroopers reach the Western Wall |publisher=The Digital Journalist |first=Yoram |last=Kaniuk |accessdate=2 December 2008}}].

As of the moment he has vastly enhanced his own prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world, diminished the standing of Israel and, at least for the moment, administered a serious setback to the US. Moreover, by simply standing where he is he places the Israelis in an extremely difficult position. He keeps the crisis at high pitch, and as long as this continues the Israelis must remain mobilized. This they cannot do for long without adverse effects upon their economy. 5. The Israelis face dismaying choices. Surprised and shaken by Nasser's action, they failed to take the instant military counteraction which might have been most effective.

Moorpark was founded in 1900 following approval of the application for the Moorpark Post Office. As of 2006, Moorpark was one of the fastest-growing cities in Ventura County.<ref name=\"keys\">{{cite book|last1=Brant| first1=Cherie|date=2006| title=Keys to the County: Touring Historic Ventura County|publisher= Ventura County Museum|isbn=978-0972936149}}.</ref> The town grew from just over 4,000 citizens in 1980 to  over 25,000 citizens by 1990. The population was 34,421 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 31,415 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of the name \"Moorpark\" is unknown, but most sources agree that the town was named after the Moorpark apricot, which used to grow in the area (hence the apricot flower on the town's seal and flag).<ref name=\"McCormack, Don 1999 Page 107\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mccormacksguides00donm_0/page/107|title=McCormack's Guides Santa Barbara and Ventura 2000|last1=McCormack|first1=Don|date=1999|publisher=McCormacks Guides|isbn=9781929365098|page=[https://archive.org/details/mccormacksguides00donm_0/page/107 107]|url-access=registration}}</ref> The apricot, in turn, was named for Admiral Lord Anson's estate [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], where he introduced the apricot in 1688.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/trees/treeGuide/TreeDetail.cfm?id=99|title= Moorpark Apricot| website=Arbor Day Foundation|accessdate= 15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theproduceguide.com/doitem.php?pnum=344|title= Dried Apricots: History|website=Coosemans Specialty Produce|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/journal-of-scott/32/|title= The Journal of Sir Walter Scott|last1= Walter|first1= Scott|date= May 27, 1828| publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate= 15 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne other theory of the name is that, when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was surveying the local land in the 19th century for its railway, someone in the party said that the area, with its sloping hills, looked like the Scottish Moors, hence the name Moorpark.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSome of Moorpark's previous unofficial and official names include '''Epworth''', '''Fremontville''', '''Penrose''', '''Fairview''', and '''Little Simi'''.<ref name=\"keys\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Chumash people]] were the first to inhabit what is now known as Moorpark. A Chumash village, known as Quimisac (Kimishax), was located in today's [[Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park]]. They were hunters and gatherers who often traveled between villages to trade. The village of Quimisac once controlled the local trade of fused [[shale]] in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Winters|first1=Michael|date=2016|title=Moorpark|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|pages=7\u20138|isbn=9781439657355}}</ref><ref name=\"gunter\">{{cite book|last1=Gunter|first1=Norma|date=1969|title=The Moorpark Story|publisher=Moorpark Chamber of Commerce|page=12}}</ref> The area was later part of the large [[Rancho Simi]] [[land grant]] given in 1795 to the Pico brothers by [[list of pre-statehood governors of California|Governor]] [[Diego de Borica]] of [[Alta California]].\n\nRobert W. Poindexter, the secretary of the Simi Land and Water Company, received the land when the association was disbanded. A map showing the townsite was prepared in November 1900. It was a resubdivision of the large lot subdivision known as Fremont, or Fremontville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.ventura.org/RecordMaps/mr/005/005mr005.pdf|title=Map of a part of Tract \"L\" of RANCHO SIMI, Ventura Co.

Poindexter|date= September 1893|website=Ventura County Recorder}}</ref> An application for a post office was submitted on June 1, 1900, and approved by August of that year. The application noted that the town had a railroad depot.<ref name=\"gunter\" /> The town grew after the 1904 completion of a [[Santa Susana Tunnel|{{convert|7369|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tunnel]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]]. Moorpark was then on the main route of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [[Coast Line (UP)|Coast Line]] between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. The depot remained in operation until it was closed in 1958. It was eventually torn down around 1965.\n\nMoorpark was one of the first cities to run off commercial [[nuclear power]] in the entire world, and the second in the United States, after [[Arco, Idaho]] on July 17, 1955, which is the first city in the world to be lit by atomic power.  For one hour on November 12, 1957, this fact was featured on Edwin R. Murrow's \"[[See It Now]]\" television show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/14/realestate/re-guide14 |title=Atomic Age footnote grows into 21st century |date=December 14, 2003|first=Maggie |last=Barnett |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref> The reactor, called the [[Sodium Reactor Experiment]] was built by the [[Atomics International]] division of [[North American Aviation]] at the nearby [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]].

Moorpark College is one of the few colleges that features an Exotic Animal Training and Management Program. Moorpark was incorporated as a city on July 1, 1983.\n\nIn 1996, Moorpark's Little League All-Star team represented the West Region in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.\n\nIn February 2005, a [[Siberian tiger]] named Tuffy that escaped from a local residence was shot and killed in one of Moorpark's parks. This created a great deal of uproar, because the [[animal control officer]]s used a gun instead of a [[tranquilizer]] to kill the tiger, primarily because the tiger could not be shot from the proper angle for a [[tranquilizer]] to prove effective. [[Vigil|Candlelight vigils]] were held for the late Tuffy.  The couple who owned the tiger had moved from a licensed facility in [[Temecula, California]], to an unlicensed facility in the Moorpark area of [[Ventura County]].  They lost their [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] exhibitor license because they failed to notify the department of the move within 10 days.  The wife pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor count of failing to maintain records of exotic felines.

With many chicken coops spread over acres of concrete with millions of chickens in them.  Most of the roads to the ranch were lined by large palm trees. The main office building had a giant chicken statue on the top of it which was later lost in a fire. Local residents were somewhat irked by the farm, when the smell of it wafted to Moorpark on windy days. The odors also commonly flowed to the nearby town of Fillmore. The Pacific Ocean can be seen from the property peaks, although it is farther inland.  The business suffered a setback in 1972, when millions of chickens were slaughtered because of the threat of [[Newcastle disease]]. There were three well sites on the property and a manmade lake near the main entrance gate. The main well at the hatchery is considered to be one of the deepest and largest privately owned wells in the entire county. In 1989, 3 more massive concrete pads were built at the hatchery location. Egg gathering was done from 36 houses by hand, with workers placing eggs onto plastic flats while riding electric carts.  Liquid, dry and shell eggs were processed at the 8,000 Sq ft hatchery facility warehouse with yolk and albumen available in individually. The farm finally closed in 1996. In early December 2006, a wildfire destroyed the dilapidated remains of Egg City.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Cecilia|issue=December 17, 2006| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/17/local/me-then17|title=Fire writes the final chapter for the world's largest egg ranch|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\nThe city government operates under a [[Council manager|council-manager]] form of government.

Moorpark was founded in 1900 following approval of the application for the Moorpark Post Office. As of 2006, Moorpark was one of the fastest-growing cities in Ventura County.<ref name=\"keys\">{{cite book|last1=Brant| first1=Cherie|date=2006| title=Keys to the County: Touring Historic Ventura County|publisher= Ventura County Museum|isbn=978-0972936149}}.</ref> The town grew from just over 4,000 citizens in 1980 to  over 25,000 citizens by 1990. The population was 34,421 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 31,415 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of the name \"Moorpark\" is unknown, but most sources agree that the town was named after the Moorpark apricot, which used to grow in the area (hence the apricot flower on the town's seal and flag).<ref name=\"McCormack, Don 1999 Page 107\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mccormacksguides00donm_0/page/107|title=McCormack's Guides Santa Barbara and Ventura 2000|last1=McCormack|first1=Don|date=1999|publisher=McCormacks Guides|isbn=9781929365098|page=[https://archive.org/details/mccormacksguides00donm_0/page/107 107]|url-access=registration}}</ref> The apricot, in turn, was named for Admiral Lord Anson's estate [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], where he introduced the apricot in 1688.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/trees/treeGuide/TreeDetail.cfm?id=99|title= Moorpark Apricot| website=Arbor Day Foundation|accessdate= 15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theproduceguide.com/doitem.php?pnum=344|title= Dried Apricots: History|website=Coosemans Specialty Produce|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/journal-of-scott/32/|title= The Journal of Sir Walter Scott|last1= Walter|first1= Scott|date= May 27, 1828| publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate= 15 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne other theory of the name is that, when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was surveying the local land in the 19th century for its railway, someone in the party said that the area, with its sloping hills, looked like the Scottish Moors, hence the name Moorpark.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSome of Moorpark\u2019s previous unofficial and official names include '''Epworth''', '''Fremontville''', '''Penrose''', '''Fairview''', and '''Little Simi'''.<ref name=\"keys\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Chumash people]] were the first to inhabit what is now known as Moorpark. A Chumash village, known as Quimisac (Kimishax), was located in today\u2019s [[Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park]]. They were hunters and gatherers who often traveled between villages to trade.

The application noted that the town had a railroad depot.<ref name=\"gunter\" /> The town grew after the 1904 completion of a [[Santa Susana Tunnel|{{convert|7369|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tunnel]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]]. Moorpark was then on the main route of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [[Coast Line (UP)|Coast Line]] between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. The depot remained in operation until it was closed in 1958. It was eventually torn down around 1965.\n\nMoorpark was one of the first cities to run off commercial [[nuclear power]] in the entire world, and the second in the United States, after [[Arco, Idaho]] on July 17, 1955, which is the first city in the world to be lit by atomic power.  For one hour on November 12, 1957, this fact was featured on Edwin R.

Moorpark College is one of the few colleges that features an Exotic Animal Training and Management Program. Moorpark was incorporated as a city on July 1, 1983.\n\nIn 1996, Moorpark's Little League All-Star team represented the West Region in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.\n\nIn February 2005, a [[Siberian tiger]] named Tuffy that escaped from a local residence was shot and killed in one of Moorpark's parks. This created a great deal of uproar, because the [[animal control officer]]s used a gun instead of a [[tranquilizer]] to kill the tiger, primarily because the tiger could not be shot from the proper angle for a [[tranquilizer]] to prove effective. [[Vigil|Candlelight vigils]] were held for the late Tuffy.  The couple who owned the tiger had moved from a licensed facility in [[Temecula, California]], to an unlicensed facility in the Moorpark area of [[Ventura County]].  They lost their [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] exhibitor license because they failed to notify the department of the move within 10 days.  The wife pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor count of failing to maintain records of exotic felines.

With many chicken coops spread over acres of concrete with millions of chickens in them.  Most of the roads to the ranch were lined by large palm trees. The main office building had a giant chicken statue on the top of it which was later lost in a fire. Local residents were somewhat irked by the farm, when the smell of it wafted to Moorpark on windy days. The odors also commonly flowed to the nearby town of Fillmore. The Pacific Ocean can be seen from the property peaks, although it is farther inland.  The business suffered a setback in 1972, when millions of chickens were slaughtered because of the threat of [[Newcastle disease]]. There were three well sites on the property and a manmade lake near the main entrance gate. The main well at the hatchery is considered to be one of the deepest and largest privately owned wells in the entire county. In 1989, 3 more massive concrete pads were built at the hatchery location. Egg gathering was done from 36 houses by hand, with workers placing eggs onto plastic flats while riding electric carts.  Liquid, dry and shell eggs were processed at the 8,000 Sq ft hatchery facility warehouse with yolk and albumen available in individually. The farm finally closed in 1996. In early December 2006, a wildfire destroyed the dilapidated remains of Egg City.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Cecilia|issue=December 17, 2006| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/17/local/me-then17|title=Fire writes the final chapter for the world's largest egg ranch|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\nThe city government operates under a [[Council manager|council-manager]] form of government.

Moore Monthly publishes a free monthly print publication while its website provides daily stories and videos about Moore, Norman and south Oklahoma City. The other media outlet is the Moore American.\n\n==Moore Veterans Memorial==\nThe City of Moore has funded the construction of a memorial to honor America's veterans and their families. The city renamed JD Estates Park to Veterans Memorial Park, and a memorial was constructed at the park entrance.\n\nThe main feature of the memorial is a {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} black granite [[obelisk]] that has the inscription, \"May this hallowed ground honor the sacrifice of America's finest veterans, civilians, and their families- past, present, and future. We will never forget.\" Another major feature of the memorial are five black granite tablets with the seal of the five branches of the American armed forces. At the center of the memorial is a flag plaza with a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} pole for the American flag and two {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} poles for the Oklahoma flag and the [[POW/MIA flag]]. The flag plaza is surrounded by a polished concrete walking area with a stained five-pointed star stretching the entire width and height of the walking area.\n\nA committee was formed to plan the second phase of the Moore Veterans Memorial. A campaign to sell bricks to be placed in the memorial was completed in early 2009. Over 190 bricks were purchased by supporters from the community and surrounding areas. The bricks were placed in the Memorial Wall and Phase II was completed in May 2009.\n\nThe Soldiers' Memorial was dedicated on May 15, 2010. It consists of four carved wooden soldiers representing the four major wars since the end of World War I. They include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Afghanistan/Iraq War.<ref>[http://www.cityofmoore.com/Community/Moore_veterans_memorial/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803124510/http://www.cityofmoore.com/Community/Moore_veterans_memorial/ |date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAfter being destroyed by the May 2013 tornado, the park won the title of \"America's Favorite Park\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livepositively.com/community/america-is-your-park/|title=Coca-Cola Global|author=|date=|website=www.livepositively.com|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> in an online competition sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], beating out numerous other parks from around the country.

Prolonged and severe droughts often lead to wildfires and heavy rainfall often leads to flash flooding and flooding. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe [[ice storm]]s and [[snowstorm]]s happen sporadically during the winter.\n\n===Damage from tornadoes===\nThe [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]] (of which Moore is a part) is located in [[Tornado Alley]] and is subject to frequent and severe tornadoes and hailstorms, making it one of the most tornado-prone major metropolitan areas in the world.\n\nMoore itself has seen nine tornadoes between 1998 and 2015, three of them big enough to claim lives and cause catastrophic damage.<ref name=\"MyUser_News.yahoo.com_March_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/is-moore-okla-the-tornado-alley-of-tornado-alley-235001410.html |title=Is Moore, Okla., the 'tornado alley of tornado alley'? - Yahoo News |newspaper=News.yahoo.com |date= March 26, 2015 |author=Jason Sickles |accessdate= March 28, 2015}}</ref> The city of Moore was damaged by significant tornadoes on [[Tornadoes of 1998#October 4|October 4, 1998]]; [[1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado|May 3, 1999]]; [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 2003#May 8 event|May 8, 2003]]; [[Tornado outbreak of May 10\u201313, 2010|May 10, 2010]]; and [[2013 Moore tornado|May 20, 2013]], with weaker tornadoes striking at other times, notably [[Tornado outbreak of May 26\u201331, 2013|May 31, 2013]] and [[List of United States tornadoes from January to March 2015#March 25 event|March 25, 2015]].

The city renamed JD Estates Park to Veterans Memorial Park, and a memorial was constructed at the park entrance.\n\nThe main feature of the memorial is a {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} black granite [[obelisk]] that has the inscription, \"May this hallowed ground honor the sacrifice of America's finest veterans, civilians, and their families- past, present, and future. We will never forget.\" Another major feature of the memorial are five black granite tablets with the seal of the five branches of the American armed forces. At the center of the memorial is a flag plaza with a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} pole for the American flag and two {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} poles for the Oklahoma flag and the [[POW/MIA flag]]. The flag plaza is surrounded by a polished concrete walking area with a stained five-pointed star stretching the entire width and height of the walking area.\n\nA committee was formed to plan the second phase of the Moore Veterans Memorial. A campaign to sell bricks to be placed in the memorial was completed in early 2009. Over 190 bricks were purchased by supporters from the community and surrounding areas. The bricks were placed in the Memorial Wall and Phase II was completed in May 2009.\n\nThe Soldiers' Memorial was dedicated on May 15, 2010. It consists of four carved wooden soldiers representing the four major wars since the end of World War I.
