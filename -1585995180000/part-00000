It was just a few blocks down from another Myrtle Beach amusement park, the [[Family Kingdom Amusement Park]]; both in the \"heart\" of Myrtle Beach. \"The Pavilion\" had well over 40 different attractions for kids and thrill-seekers alike, and included the wooden rollercoaster Hurricane: Category 5. Despite all the best efforts made by citizens to save the park, it was lost to redevelopment in 2007.<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\">{{cite web|title=Coaster-Net: Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]|url=http://www.coaster-net.com/park-gallery/85-myrtle-beach-pavilion-defunct/|publisher=Coaster-Net|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>  While the park was officially closed and became a vacant lot on 9th Avenue and Ocean Boulevard in 2007, some of the rides and attractions were moved to [[Broadway at the Beach]].  Broadway at the Beach and the land at 9th Avenue are both owned by [[Burroughs & Chapin]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the Myrtle Beach Pavilion Amusement Park, several Pavilions were built before the one that lasted the longest, and all  were a product of [[Burroughs & Chapin]], one of the companies responsible for the development of the Myrtle Beach area. Each of the Pavilions had a different architectural style and were even built of different materials, but all served as a place where the community could gather for interaction and entertainment.<ref name=\"Stokes85\">{{cite book|author=Barbara F.

It was destroyed by a fire,<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|86}} though the bricks from that site were later used in nearby [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]].<ref>Jason M. Rodriguez, \"Take a stroll through Conway, ''The Sun News'', July 27, 2013.</ref> The Pavilion was later rebuilt in 1923 as a two-story complex, expanded in 1938, which was hit with another fire in 1944 which burned the building to the ground. It was rebuilt for a third time out of poured concrete, opening in 1949,<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|88, 90\u201391}} and had a large wooden dance floor which was located on the second floor along with a stage and grandstands.\n\nThe amusement park itself began development on the west side of Ocean Boulevard, across the street from the new Pavilion building in 1948. A traveling carnival that had stopped in [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway, SC]] for the annual Tobacco Festival, but soon found a permanent home across the street from the Pavilion and after the carnival signed an agreement with Myrtle Beach Farms, the Myrtle Beach Pavilion Amusement Park was born.  Numerous acts such as ice skaters, bear acts, and talent shows were immediately brought in to supplement the carnival and also to help boost interest in the new \"park.\"\n\nIn 1950, just two years after its opening, the company now called [[Burroughs & Chapin]] bought out the Central Amusement Company the owners of the park at the time and added 14 new rides to the park and also added new concessions to the park. Over the years, the park would add and exchange numerous carnival-style flat rides, as well as suffering and fighting through several hurricanes.\n\nAmong its significant historical attractions were the Herschell-Sillman Carousel as well as the Baden Band Organ. The Carousel itself dates back to 1912, and include numerous types of animals such as: frogs, lions, ostriches, zebras, giraffes, and even dragons instead of using the classical horses. The only horse found on the carousel is the \"lead horse.\" which was decorated in great detail and was located on the outside row of the ride. Even though the area has unfriendly weather and climatic condition near the beach, the carousel has been maintained well over the year and it still continues to operate to this day at Pavilion Nostalgia at Broadway At The Beach and is one of only 15 working Herschell-Spillman carousels in the country.\n\nThe Baden Band Organ was originally hand-built, decorated and crafted by A. Ruth & Sohn in [[Waldkirch|Waldkirch Baden, Germany]] for display at the 1900 [[World's fair|World Exposition]] in [[Paris]]. After the World Exposition the organ traveled all around [[Europe]] on a wagon and in 1954 Myrtle Beach Farms bought it for The Pavilion. Its \"twirling figures and [[cherub]]s that play [[cymbal]]s, bells and drums\" entertained people for decades. The organ used [[Book music|cardboard music]], had over 400 pipes, 98 keys, and was 20 feet wide, 11 feet high and 7 feet deep, making it a giant organ that also weighed two tons.<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|93}}<ref name=organ/>\n\nBeside the numerous carnival-style [[Flat ride]]s and a variety of [[Kiddie ride]]s normally found at [[Carnival]]s, [[fairs]] or [[amusement park]]s, there was a [[Log flume (ride)|log flume ride]], a [[River rafting ride]] called the HydroSURGE, a Haunted Hotel dark ride, and was the home to six roller coasters during the Pavilions nearly 60 year life. The first rollercoaster was received in 1951 and was called Comet Jr, which was a pint sized wooden coaster that was built by [[National Amusement Devices|National Amusement Devices Company]] that remained at the park until the late 1960s. The park also had a S.D.C. Galaxi model roller coaster at one point, which was simply called Galaxi that was removed from the park in 1997.  One of the smaller coaster front the park had a train-themed Mack family coaster called the Little Eagle that opened in 1986. The Arrow Dynamics' Mad Mouse wild mouse coaster opened in 1998 which replaced the Galaxi that was removed from the park a year earlier. After the closure of the park, both of these small coasters were moved to the NASCAR Speedpark in also in Myrtle Beach.\n\nIn 1978, the park added its first major coaster, which was the steel looping Corkscrew, also built by [[Arrow Development]], that had been relocated to the Pavilion from the Magic Harbor amusement park. The coaster featured a 70-foot drop, as well as double corkscrews along the rides 1,250 foot long course. After it was in operation for 31 years at the park it was closed and relocated to the Salitre Magico park in [[Colombia]] in order to make way for the parks new signature coaster, Hurricane: Category 5 (known as \"Hurricane\" for short) that was built by [[Custom Coasters International]] (CCI) at a total cost of $6 million. The \"Hurricane\" was a 3,800-foot long, hybrid-structure coaster that featured an out-and-back style layout that included 14 turns and double helices at each, a 100-foot drop, and a top speed of 55&nbsp;mph. It opened in 2000. At the time of the parks closing in 2006, the \"Hurricane\" was scrapped, but the Gerstlauer trains ride was purchased by [[Kings Island]] to use on their modified [[Son of Beast]] coaster.\n\nJust shortly before the start of the 2006 operation season, [[Burroughs & Chapin]] the owner of the Pavilion announced that the 2006 would be the park's final operating season. The park officially held its last public operating day on September 24, 2006, but held a special \"Last Ride\" event for select participants on September 30. The announcement of the closure of the park lead to the park to see record profits as well as attendance, but there was no hope to try to save the park due to what the parks owners called to \"financial instability.\"\n\nWhile both the Haunted Hotel and Hurricane roller coaster were demolished following closure of the parks, not all of The Pavilion was lost. The parks carousel along with the Baden Band Organ, and several other small parks were relocated to \"mini-park,\" called the Pavilion Nostalgia Park that is located at [[Broadway at the Beach]] also in Myrtle Beach, that opened in 2007. Even though the area where the Pavilion used to be still sits vacant, and several nearby business have been devastated by the loss, both the Pavilion Nostalgia Park and a commemorative historical marker will not allow The Pavilion's memory and history to be lost.\n\nThe slogan for the Farewell Season was \"One More Ride, One More Thrill, One More Memory, One Last Time.\"<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\" />\n\n== Closure ==\n[[Image:Myrtle Beach Pavilion Mad Mouse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mad Mouse (Pavilion)|Mad Mouse]] and [[Hurricane (ride)|Hurricane]]]]\n\nThe owners of the Pavilion, [[Burroughs & Chapin]], announced shortly before its 2006 opening that that would be its final season. The 2006 season ended for the public on September 24, 2006, although a select number of people were able to participate in a \"Last Ride\" event held on September 30, 2006.  The farewell season proved extremely popular and the park enjoyed record attendance and profits.<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\" /> Several online petitions were circulated in hopes of saving the Pavilion,<ref>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Fighting to preserve a long-ago way of life|url=http://www.chrisdixonreports.com/postandcourier/pavilion1.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The State Newspaper|date=16 March 2006}}</ref> but Burroughs & Chapin stated that financial instability would force them to shut down park operations. At about the time the closing was announced, construction on the [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock]] Park (now [[Freestyle Music Park]] and also in Myrtle Beach) was set to begin, which would also later close.\n\nThe park's historic carousel and the Baden Band Organ were subsequently relocated to [[Broadway at the Beach]], also in Myrtle Beach;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayatthebeach.com/Pavilion_Nostalgia_Park_News_Release.pdf|title=Burroughs & Chapin to open \"The Pavilion Nostalgia Park\" at Broadway at the Beach this summer|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> however, the Haunted Hotel and the multimillion-dollar [[Hurricane (ride)|Hurricane]] were demolished.

It was just a few blocks down from another Myrtle Beach amusement park, the [[Family Kingdom Amusement Park]]; both in the \"heart\" of Myrtle Beach. \"The Pavilion\" had well over 40 different attractions for kids and thrill-seekers alike, and included the wooden rollercoaster Hurricane: Category 5. Despite all the best efforts made by citizens to save the park, it was lost to redevelopment in 2007.<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\">{{cite web|title=Coaster-Net: Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]|url=http://www.coaster-net.com/park-gallery/85-myrtle-beach-pavilion-defunct/|publisher=Coaster-Net|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>  While the park was officially closed and became a vacant lot on 9th Avenue and Ocean Boulevard in 2007, some of the rides and attractions were moved to [[Broadway at the Beach]].  Broadway at the Beach and the land at 9th Avenue are both owned by [[Burroughs & Chapin]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the Myrtle Beach Pavilion Amusement Park, several Pavilions were built before the one that lasted the longest, and all  were a product of [[Burroughs & Chapin]], one of the companies responsible for the development of the Myrtle Beach area. Each of the Pavilions had a different architectural style and were even built of different materials, but all served as a place where the community could gather for interaction and entertainment.<ref name=\"Stokes85\">{{cite book|author=Barbara F. Stokes|title=Myrtle Beach: A History, 1900-1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pfe0mFFO_EC&pg=PA85|year=2007|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-697-2}}</ref>{{rp|85}}\n\nThe first Pavilion that was built in 1908 was a one-story building that was part of Myrtle Beach's first hotel, the now long gone Seaside Inn. It was destroyed by a fire,<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|86}} though the bricks from that site were later used in nearby [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]].<ref>Jason M. Rodriguez, \"Take a stroll through Conway, ''The Sun News'', July 27, 2013.</ref> The Pavilion was later rebuilt in 1923 as a two-story complex, expanded in 1938, which was hit with another fire in 1944 which burned the building to the ground. It was rebuilt for a third time out of poured concrete, opening in 1949,<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|88, 90\u201391}} and had a large wooden dance floor which was located on the second floor along with a stage and grandstands.\n\nThe amusement park itself began development on the west side of Ocean Boulevard, across the street from the new Pavilion building in 1948. A traveling carnival that had stopped in [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway, SC]] for the annual Tobacco Festival, but soon found a permanent home across the street from the Pavilion and after the carnival signed an agreement with Myrtle Beach Farms, the Myrtle Beach Pavilion Amusement Park was born.  Numerous acts such as ice skaters, bear acts, and talent shows were immediately brought in to supplement the carnival and also to help boost interest in the new \"park.\"\n\nIn 1950, just two years after its opening, the company now called [[Burroughs & Chapin]] bought out the Central Amusement Company the owners of the park at the time and added 14 new rides to the park and also added new concessions to the park. Over the years, the park would add and exchange numerous carnival-style flat rides, as well as suffering and fighting through several hurricanes.\n\nAmong its significant historical attractions were the Herschell-Sillman Carousel as well as the Baden Band Organ. The Carousel itself dates back to 1912, and include numerous types of animals such as: frogs, lions, ostriches, zebras, giraffes, and even dragons instead of using the classical horses. The only horse found on the carousel is the \"lead horse.\" which was decorated in great detail and was located on the outside row of the ride. Even though the area has unfriendly weather and climatic condition near the beach, the carousel has been maintained well over the year and it still continues to operate to this day at Pavilion Nostalgia at Broadway At The Beach and is one of only 15 working Herschell-Spillman carousels in the country.\n\nThe Baden Band Organ was originally hand-built, decorated and crafted by A. Ruth & Sohn in [[Waldkirch|Waldkirch Baden, Germany]] for display at the 1900 [[World's fair|World Exposition]] in [[Paris]]. After the World Exposition the organ traveled all around [[Europe]] on a wagon and in 1954 Myrtle Beach Farms bought it for The Pavilion. Its \"twirling figures and [[cherub]]s that play [[cymbal]]s, bells and drums\" entertained people for decades. The organ used [[Book music|cardboard music]], had over 400 pipes, 98 keys, and was 20 feet wide, 11 feet high and 7 feet deep, making it a giant organ that also weighed two tons.<ref name=\"Stokes85\"/>{{rp|93}}<ref name=organ/>\n\nBeside the numerous carnival-style [[Flat ride]]s and a variety of [[Kiddie ride]]s normally found at [[Carnival]]s, [[fairs]] or [[amusement park]]s, there was a [[Log flume (ride)|log flume ride]], a [[River rafting ride]] called the HydroSURGE, a Haunted Hotel dark ride, and was the home to six roller coasters during the Pavilions nearly 60 year life. The first rollercoaster was received in 1951 and was called Comet Jr, which was a pint sized wooden coaster that was built by [[National Amusement Devices|National Amusement Devices Company]] that remained at the park until the late 1960s. The park also had a S.D.C. Galaxi model roller coaster at one point, which was simply called Galaxi that was removed from the park in 1997.  One of the smaller coaster front the park had a train-themed Mack family coaster called the Little Eagle that opened in 1986. The Arrow Dynamics' Mad Mouse wild mouse coaster opened in 1998 which replaced the Galaxi that was removed from the park a year earlier. After the closure of the park, both of these small coasters were moved to the NASCAR Speedpark in also in Myrtle Beach.\n\nIn 1978, the park added its first major coaster, which was the steel looping Corkscrew, also built by [[Arrow Development]], that had been relocated to the Pavilion from the Magic Harbor amusement park. The coaster featured a 70-foot drop, as well as double corkscrews along the rides 1,250 foot long course. After it was in operation for 31 years at the park it was closed and relocated to the Salitre Magico park in [[Colombia]] in order to make way for the parks new signature coaster, Hurricane: Category 5 (known as \"Hurricane\" for short) that was built by [[Custom Coasters International]] (CCI) at a total cost of $6 million. The \"Hurricane\" was a 3,800-foot long, hybrid-structure coaster that featured an out-and-back style layout that included 14 turns and double helices at each, a 100-foot drop, and a top speed of 55&nbsp;mph. It opened in 2000. At the time of the parks closing in 2006, the \"Hurricane\" was scrapped, but the Gerstlauer trains ride was purchased by [[Kings Island]] to use on their modified [[Son of Beast]] coaster.\n\nJust shortly before the start of the 2006 operation season, [[Burroughs & Chapin]] the owner of the Pavilion announced that the 2006 would be the park's final operating season. The park officially held its last public operating day on September 24, 2006, but held a special \"Last Ride\" event for select participants on September 30. The announcement of the closure of the park lead to the park to see record profits as well as attendance, but there was no hope to try to save the park due to what the parks owners called to \"financial instability.\"\n\nWhile both the Haunted Hotel and Hurricane roller coaster were demolished following closure of the parks, not all of The Pavilion was lost. The parks carousel along with the Baden Band Organ, and several other small parks were relocated to \"mini-park,\" called the Pavilion Nostalgia Park that is located at [[Broadway at the Beach]] also in Myrtle Beach, that opened in 2007. Even though the area where the Pavilion used to be still sits vacant, and several nearby business have been devastated by the loss, both the Pavilion Nostalgia Park and a commemorative historical marker will not allow The Pavilion's memory and history to be lost.\n\nThe slogan for the Farewell Season was \"One More Ride, One More Thrill, One More Memory, One Last Time.\"<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\" />\n\n== Closure ==\n[[Image:Myrtle Beach Pavilion Mad Mouse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mad Mouse (Pavilion)|Mad Mouse]] and [[Hurricane (roller coaster)|Hurricane]]]]\n\nThe owners of the Pavilion, [[Burroughs & Chapin]], announced shortly before its 2006 opening that that would be its final season. The 2006 season ended for the public on September 24, 2006, although a select number of people were able to participate in a \"Last Ride\" event held on September 30, 2006.  The farewell season proved extremely popular and the park enjoyed record attendance and profits.<ref name=\"Coaster-Net:Myrtle Beach Pavilion [defunct]\" /> Several online petitions were circulated in hopes of saving the Pavilion,<ref>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Fighting to preserve a long-ago way of life|url=http://www.chrisdixonreports.com/postandcourier/pavilion1.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The State Newspaper|date=16 March 2006}}</ref> but Burroughs & Chapin stated that financial instability would force them to shut down park operations. At about the time the closing was announced, construction on the [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock]] Park (now [[Freestyle Music Park]] and also in Myrtle Beach) was set to begin, which would also later close.\n\nThe park's historic carousel and the Baden Band Organ were subsequently relocated to [[Broadway at the Beach]], also in Myrtle Beach;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayatthebeach.com/Pavilion_Nostalgia_Park_News_Release.pdf|title=Burroughs & Chapin to open \"The Pavilion Nostalgia Park\" at Broadway at the Beach this summer|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> however, the Haunted Hotel and the multimillion-dollar [[Hurricane (roller coaster)|Hurricane]] were demolished.

The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]]. They also reached the [[Kent Senior Cup]] final, played at Hayes Lane on 26 July, where they lost to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web | title = Match Report: Cray Wanderers 0 Ebbsfleet United 4 | publisher = Official Website | date = | url = http://www.craywands.co.uk/cray0ebbsfleet4.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Cray again reached the play-off final the following year, in which they beat [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]] 1\u20130 and were promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]].\n\nCray Wanderers celebrated their 150th anniversary during the summer of 2010, including friendlies against the other two oldest clubs in the world, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] and [[Hallam F.C.|Hallam]], in a three-team tournament.\n\nIan Jenkins, who had managed the club for 14 years, left in September 2013.<ref>[http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 Kentishfootball.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140419/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref> Keith Bird and [[Mick Paye|Mike Paye]], managers of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s reserve team, were appointed as manager and assistant manager respectively. The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end.

Based on later reports, the club has a claim to have been established some time in 1860 in the twin villages of [[St. Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]], near [[Orpington]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vain Games of No Value by Terry Morris | publisher = Author House| date = 2016 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GrfCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122&dq=Cray+Wanderers+1860&source=bl&ots=6YFc0q4QOr&sig=vX_cTjNOLwV-y_5PxSe0B5S7eiI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT-fifn8XMAhWE6xQKHeqGAGM4HhDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&q=Cray%20Wanderers%201860&f=false | accessdate = 15 September 2016}}</ref> Such a date would make it one of the [[oldest football club]]s in the world.\n\nThey currently play their home matches at [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s [[Hayes Lane]] ground (capacity 5,000). Cray Wanderers were [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] champions four times, and have reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]] once in their history. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|CrayWand}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first origins of Cray Wanderers are linked to the construction of the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] line during 1858 to 1860.<ref name=\"OHist\"/> During their leisure time, migrant workers kicked a ball around, and that is how the club originated in the [[St Mary Cray]] village. The pitch at Star Lane is now a cemetery, and is located beneath the nine-arch railway viaduct that spans the Cray Valley. The industrial belt of the [[River Cray]], especially the paper mills, provided much of the club's support up till the 1950s.\n   \nCray Wanderers were a strong force in senior county football at the turn of the century. After being Kent Junior Cup semi-finalists and finalists in 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 they entered the first ever [[FA Amateur Cup]] competition in 1893\u201394. They had a spell as a professional club between 1895 and 1907. They were a nursery club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] during part of this period. They were one of the founder members of the [[Kent Football League|Kent League]] in 1894\u201395, and they won the championship in 1901\u201302. Other honours included Southern Suburban League champions in 1898\u201399, West Kent League champions in 1903\u201304, and [[Kent Senior Cup]] runners-up in 1899\u20131900.\n\nAfter [[World War One]], Cray switched to the [[London League (football)|London League]] where they remained till 1934. In the 1930\u201331 season they won the Kent Amateur Cup. Cray rejoined the Kent League in 1934\u201335, but their four-year stay came to grief when 1936 saw the loss of the Fordcroft ground in Cray Avenue, their home since 1898. Cray were forced to drop into a lower level of football, drifting from one temporary pitch to another while the club committee dwindled to a perilously small number. The team struggled badly in the South London Alliance and the Kent Amateur League.\n\n1951/52 heralded a new era, and an upturn in the club's fortunes, when local businessman Mick Slater took over at the helm. The club was elected to the London League and regained its senior status. Cray moved to a new ground at Grassmeade in 1955. Their stay there was a very successful period in the club's history. Drawing extra support from the commuter town of [[Orpington]], they played in the London League and then the [[Aetolian League]]. They were three times crowned champions, won the League Cup twice, and also won the Kent Amateur Cup three times.\n\nCray switched to the semi-professional [[Metropolitan League]] for five seasons commencing in 1966\u201367. In 1971\u201372 the [[Metropolitan London League|Met London League]] was created by a merger of the Metropolitan League and the [[Greater London League]].\n   \nCray moved to Oxford Road in 1973\u201374. Johnny Biddle and Jimmy Wakeling proved to be successful managers. In 1974/75 Cray won the Met London League and League Cup, scoring 170 goals in all matches that season. In 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 Cray won the [[London Spartan League]] championship.\n\nCray decided to return to the Kent League in 1978\u201379. Success came quickly because Cray won the championship in 1980/81, having been runners-up the year before. Their powerful new team under manager Harry Richardson reached the [[FA Vase]] quarter-final and 5th round in those two seasons. After that, the 1980s decade brought only one more piece of silverware, the Kent League Cup in 1983\u201384. After finishing Kent League runners up in 1990/91, Cray had a lean period during most of the 1990s, with the exception of 1992\u201393 when they won the Kent Senior Trophy.\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers FC Kent League champions 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Kent League champions in 1981.]]\n\nA new club chairman Gary Hillman arrived in 1994/95 and Ian Jenkins, a Cray player since 1993, was appointed manager in 1999. By now, Cray were tenants of [[Bromley F.C.]]. As champions of the Kent League in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, also reaching the FA Vase quarter-final, they achieved promotion into the Isthmian League Division One.\n\nIn the [[Isthmian League 2007-08|2007\u201308]] season Cray reached the play-off final after finishing 3rd in the table, but lost to [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]] 1\u20130 at [[Imperial Fields]]. They also reached the [[Kent Senior Cup]] final, played at Hayes Lane on 26 July, where they lost to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web | title = Match Report: Cray Wanderers 0 Ebbsfleet United 4 | publisher = Official Website | date = | url = http://www.craywands.co.uk/cray0ebbsfleet4.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Cray again reached the play-off final the following year, in which they beat [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]] 1\u20130 and were promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]].\n\nCray Wanderers celebrated their 150th anniversary during the summer of 2010, including friendlies against the other two oldest clubs in the world, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] and [[Hallam F.C.|Hallam]], in a three-team tournament.\n\nIan Jenkins, who had managed the club for 14 years, left in September 2013.<ref>[http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 Kentishfootball.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140419/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9312&Itemid=38 |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref> Keith Bird and [[Mick Paye|Mike Paye]], managers of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]]'s reserve team, were appointed as manager and assistant manager respectively. The team was relegated into the Isthmian League Division One North at the end of April 2014. Gary Abbott and Mike Paye became joint managers of the team at the start of October 2014. On 5 January 2015 the club appointed Tommy Warrilow as the new manager. Warrilow masterminded a dramatic \"Great Escape\" from a second successive relegation as the team won their last ten games of the season.\n\nFormer player Tony Russell took over for the [[2015-16 Isthmian League|2015\u201316]] season, guiding the team to fourth place in Division One North. Cray therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs but lost to [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Two years later, they reached the play-offs again, this time after finishing 3rd in Division One South, but lost 5\u20132 to [[Walton Casuals F.C.|Walton Casuals]].

After playing at numerous other grounds, Cray played at Grassmeade from 1954 to 1973, after which they moved to Oxford Road.  Unfortunately for the club, in 1998 the Kent League ruled that clubs must have floodlighting.  As Cray were unable to have lights installed, they were forced to move out and share the Hayes Lane ground of [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], although their reserve and youth teams continued to play at the former ground until 2011, when it was taken over by [[Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C.|Seven Acre Sports & Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Club History (brief)| publisher = Sporting Club Thamesmead F.C. | url = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/sportingclubthamesmeadfc/a/a-brief-history-of-sporting-club-thamesmead-fc-31729.html | accessdate = 2016-11-16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Cray Wanderers at Oxford Road in 1997.]]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Cray announced plans to move to a new stadium near Orpington by 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chairman has grounds for optimism ahead of play-offs |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=28 April 2008 |url=http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013001/http://www.kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3051&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenkins faces Cup Final selection dilemma |publisher=Kentishfootball |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904013006/http://kentishfootball.co.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3288&Itemid=38 |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>  Official plans published on the club's official website on 18 February 2009 confirmed that the new ground at Sandy Lane would be open by 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season, subject to planning consent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cray Stop Wandering After 40 Years! |publisher=Official Website |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |accessdate=2009-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074138/http://www.craywands.co.uk/component/content/article/102-nowander |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref>  The stadium, which is proposed to be part of a new \"Sports Village-like complex\" is set to be eco-friendly and be built to an initial [[Football Conference|Conference]] standard.\n\nThe bid was rejected unanimously, by all councillors on Bromley Council's Development Control Committee on Thursday 20 September 2012. This was for a number of reasons, but mainly because the Club was hoping to build a Football League sized stadium, using the profits from building nearly 200 houses and a large hotel on Green Belt land.\n\nIn the debate on the application, which was opposed by the Police and the GLA as well as other bodies, it was clear that Councillors were supportative of a proposal to relocate Cray Wanderers to a new home in St. Pauls Cray, but not to the building of houses, a hotel and another swimming pool, given that LA Leisure already have a swimming pool opposite the site, in order to fund it.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre in St Paul\u2019s Cray on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club had an 18-month period to obtain planning consent from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 1,300. This was achieved in April 2016, when the Council approved the proposal.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bromley Council approve planning permission for Flamingo Park | publisher = Official website | date = 19 April 2016 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/bromley-council-approve-planning-approval/  | accessdate = 2016-04-30}}</ref> There was disappointment when the application was later refused by the [[Mayor of London]] and a revised set of plans were being prepared in 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stadium updates | publisher = Official website | date = 13 April 2017 | url = http://www.cray-wanderers.com/stadium-updates/  | accessdate = 2017-05-17}}</ref>.

Several other players have made first team appearances during the first season.\n\nIt was decided at the beginning of 2016 that this arrangement with Coopers School would come to an end. The club are looking at establishing another Academy setup in the next couple of years.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Isthmian League]] Division One\n**Winners (South East): [[2018\u201319 Isthmian League|2018\u201319]]\n**Runners-up (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n**Play-off Winners (South): [[2008-09 Isthmian League|2008\u201309]]\n*[[Kent Football League|Kent League]]: 1901\u201302, 1980\u201381, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304\n**Runners Up: 1979\u201380, 1990\u201391\n*[[London League (football)|London League]]: 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358\n**Runners Up: 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355\n*[[Aetolian League (football)|Aetolian League]]: 1962\u201363\n*[[Greater London League]]: 1965-66\n*[[Metropolitan-London League]]: 1974-75\n*[[London Spartan League]]: 1976\u201377, 1977\u201378\n*[[Kent Senior Trophy]]: 1992-92, 2003\u201304\n*[[Kent Amateur Cup]]: 1930\u201331, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365\n*Best league performance: 9th in [[Isthmian League Premier Division]], [[2010\u201311 Isthmian League|2010\u201311]], [[2011\u201312 Isthmian League|2011\u201312]], (Cray were 2nd in the Isthmian League Premier Division when the 2019-20 season was abandoned in March 2020)\n*Best [[FA Cup]] performance: 4th qualifying round, 2005\u201306\n*Best [[FA Amateur Cup]] performance: 3rd round (last 16), 1967-68\n*Best [[FA Trophy]] performance: 2nd round (equivalent of current 3rd qualifying round), 2004\u201305. 3rd qualifying round, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008\u201309, 2012\u201313, 2014\u201315, 2017\u201318\n*Best [[FA Vase]] performance: Quarter-finals, 1979\u201380, 2003\u201304<ref>{{fchd|name=Cray Wanderers|id=CRAYW}}</ref>\n*Best [[Kent Senior Cup]] performance: Final, 1900\u201301, 2007\u201308\n\n==Current squad==\n<ref>[https://www.cray-wanderers.com/teams/first-team/ First team] Cray Wanderers F.C.</ref>\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Lewis Carey}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Grant Hall}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Tom Carlse}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Jay Leader}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Mitchell Nelson}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Geofrey Okwonko}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Joe Vines|other=player-assistant manager}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Barney Williams}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Charlie Allen (footballer)|Charlie Allen]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Karl Dent}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Charles Etumnu}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Jerome Federico]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Lee Lewis}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Ben Mundele}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Tom Phipp}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ZIM|pos=MF|name=[[Bradley Pritchard]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Aaron Rhule}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=AUS|pos=MF|name=[[Joel Rollinson]]|other=on loan from [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=[[Tom Murphy (English footballer)|Tom Murphy]]}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Joe Taylor}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Freddie Parker}}\n{{fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Rhys Murrell-Williamson}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Club staff==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Name\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Club Management'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Tony Russell\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Player-Assistant Manager\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Joe Vines\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Nathan White\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Goalkeeping Coach\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Grant Hall\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Physio\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Ally Maloney\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Board'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Chairman\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagicon|ENG}} Gary Hillman\n|-\n|}\n\n==Records==\n*Record attendance: 2160 vs [[Leytonstone F.C.|Leytonstone]] ([[FA Amateur Cup]], 1969)\n*Biggest Win: 15\u20130 vs [[Sevenoaks Town F.C.|Sevenoaks]], 1894\u201395\n*Biggest Defeat: 1\u201311 vs [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]], 1920\u201321\n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Win: 9\u20131 vs, [[Ashford United]]  2017\u201318 \n*Biggest [[Isthmian League]] Defeat: 3\u20139 vs Kingstonian, 2012\u201313\n\n===Player records===\n*Most appearances: John Dorey, 454 (1961\u201372), Jamie Wood, 461 (including some as non-playing sub) (1996-2010)\n*Most goals: Ken Collishaw, 274 (1954\u201365)\n\n==Managerial history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n \n|-\n!
