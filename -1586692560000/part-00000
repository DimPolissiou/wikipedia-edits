X-9 used the name \"Dexter\" in the first story (\"It's not my name, but it'll do.\") and kept using it or being called by it in later stories, but acquired the name \"Phil Corrigan\" in the 1940s. Decades later, the strip was renamed '''Secret Agent Corrigan'''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/x-9.htm |title=Secret Agent X-9}}</ref> The nameless agency was also specifically identified as the [[FBI]], but this would be downplayed in the '70s as the Bureau weathered bad publicity and was once more nameless.\n\nAfter four stories by Hammett, Alex Raymond illustrated two stories written by Don Moore and one written by [[Leslie Charteris]], who then wrote three more stories illustrated by {{ill|Charles Flanders|fr}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} After Charteris left the strip in 1936, scripts were credited to a King Features house name, \"Robert Storm\".<ref name=\"Holtz\" /> Nicholas Afonsky drew the strip for most of 1938, followed by [[Austin Briggs]] until 1940.<ref name=\"Holtz\" />\n\n{{ill|Mel Graff|fr}} took over the art in 1940 and began writing the strip as well in 1942, devising the name Phil Corrigan. The name Phil Corrigan was inspired by Phil Cardigan, a character in one of Graff's earlier comic strips, ''The Adventures of Patsy''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nGraff also gave X-9 more of a personal life, introducing Belinda \"Linda\" Reed as Corrigan's gal Friday and early romantic interest in 1940. Wilda Dorre (later Dorray), a beautiful, blonde mystery novelist, debuted in late 1944 as a romantic rival. Corrigan finally chooses Wilda in 1947. Graff provides Linda a happy ending as well, as she marries Phil's younger brother, Bing, who was introduced in 1945 and is Phil's partner through 1947. Both female characters inspired popular songs: \"Linda\" written by Jack Lawrence and \"Wilda\" written by Graff. Wilda and Phil marry in 1950, and the two have a daughter, Philda, in 1952.<ref>\"Secret Agent X-9: Spies, Strong Women and One Hip Mohawk\" by Mark Carlson-Ghost [http://www.markcarlson-ghost.com/index.php/2017/06/10/secret-agent-x-9/] retrieved 9/30/2017</ref>\n\nGraff also created a series of often grotesque villains with colorful names, including Blue-Jaw (introduced in 1944), Goldplate (1945), Liver-Lips (1946, 1947), and Grape-Eyes (1947). There was also Corrigan's criminal lookalike, Phil Haze (1946). Additionally, Corrigan encountered the beautiful criminal businesswoman Bargain Benny (1954) and the endearing rogue Prince Iguana (1953). Corrigan also had two professional colleagues in addition to his brother: Joe Florida (1948) and Joe Otterfoot (1952). Otterfoot is the rare depiction of a Native American in comic strips of this period in that he is portrayed as intelligent, competent, witty and attractive enough for a female painter to seek him out as a male model. He is also unique for having an interracial romance with that painter.<ref>\"Secret Agent X-9: Spies, Strong Women and One Hip Mohawk' by Mark Carlson-Ghost [http://www.markcarlson-ghost.com/index.php/2017/06/10/secret-agent-x-9/] retrieved 9/30/2017</ref>\n\nGraff was followed by artist [[Bob Lubbers]], who used the pseudonym \"Bob Lewis\" and drew the strip from 1960 through 1966. From 1967 to 1980, the strip was written by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and drawn by [[Al Williamson]]. After a few years, Goodwin eliminated Wilda with an off-panel divorce in order to free up Corrigan for romance with the various attractive women he encountered. The attractive and intelligent Karla Kopak appeared in a number of stories between 1974 and 1980. Making her the niece of Kalla Kopak, a character from the comic strip ''Brick Bradford'', Goodwin tied the narratives of the two strips together. He also introduced a number of villains, including criminal matriarch Millicent Murkley (1967), hitman Joe Ice (1969), and Corrigan's nemesis, Doctor Seven (1971).<ref>\"Secret Agent X-9\" by Mark Carlson-Ghost [http://www.markcarlson-ghost.com/index.php/2017/06/10/secret-agent-x-9/] retrieved 9/30/17</ref>\n\nThe strip's final artist was veteran [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], who wrote and drew it from 1980 to his retirement in 1996. Evans introduced two romantic interests for Corrigan: Anina Kreemar, the wealthy niece of Corrigan's bureau chief, and Corrigan's friendly rival Jennever Brand, a spirited female agent of a rival clandestine spy agency.\n\nIn 2000\u20132001, X-9 made a guest appearance in the ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[Sunday strip]].

The first part (\"The Key to Power\") was written by Goodwin and drawn by Williamson. The other parts are uncredited.\n\n===Scandinavia and western Europe===\n''Secret Agent X-9'' has had a long history in European comic books. ''Agent X9'', in [[Scandinavia]] and the Nordic countries, started in 1969 under the title ''X9'' in Sweden. Its two backup titles were generally \"[[Jungle Jim]]\" and \"[[The Phantom]]\". In 1971 the magazine was renamed ''Agent X9'' and retooled into an anthology title, publishing many different comics in frequent rotation. After this, the feature \"Secret Agent X-9\" no longer appeared in every issue.\n\nThe ''Agent X9'' comic book has been published in the following countries:\n* Sweden (as ''X9'' until 1971): 1969\u2013present\n* Finland (as ''Agentti X9''): 1973-1994, 2010\n* Norway: 1974-2015, 2017\u20132019\n* Denmark: 1976-2002\n* West Germany: 1976-1977\n* Netherlands: 1984-1985\n\nDuring the 1980s, the ''Agent X9'' editors requested more ''Secret Agent X-9'' material from [[King Features]] since the newspaper stories were quickly published. King Features then began to supply the magazine with exclusive stories that have never been published elsewhere. Although these stories were made directly for comic magazines, they were produced in the regular daily strip format. The following produced stories for the ''Agent X9'' magazine:\n\n* [[Joe Gill]] (script) and [[Jack Sparling]] (art): two stories (1983)\n* M. Gill (script) and Miguel A. Repetto (art): 30 stories (1985\u20131995)\n* Dean Davis (script) and [[John Dixon (cartoonist)|John Dixon]] (art): 16 stories (1997\u20132003)\n* [[Mike W.

It featured reprints of the newspaper strips.\n\n==Films==\n[[Image:Agentx9movie.jpg|thumb|right|''Secret Agent X-9'' (1945) movie poster]]\n\n'''''Secret Agent X-9''''' was the subject of two [[Serial (film)|film serials]] [[Secret Agent X-9 (1937 serial)|in 1937]] and [[Secret Agent X-9 (1945 serial)|in 1945]]. In the first, Scott Kolk played Agent Dexter a.k.a. Agent X-9. One of his top assignments is to recover the crown jewels of Belgravia and to capture master thief Blackstone. Accompanying him is Shara Graustark (Jean Rogers), who has her own reasons and agenda. The second serial, ''Secret Agent X-9'', starred a young [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Phil Corrigan/X-9. In the 13 chapters, American, Australian and  Chinese agents join forces against the Nazis and Japanese to uncover and possess the formula that will help create a synthetic aviation fuel, code-named \"722\". [[Keye Luke]] co-starred as Chinese agent Ah Fong, Jan Wiley as Australian agent Lynn Moore, [[Victoria Horne]] as Japanese master spy Nabura and [[Benson Fong]] as Japanese scientist Dr. Hakahima. The three-country alliance is referred as the United Nations, predating the term's use with the real-life organisation.\n\n==Radio==\n''Secret Agent X-9'' was adapted as a radio drama broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]] in January 2009, starring [[Stuart Milligan]] as X-9 and [[Connie Booth]] as Grace Powers. There were four episodes, adapted by Mark Brissenden and directed by Chris Wallis.\n\n==Reprints==\nIn 1976, Nostalgia Press published a trade paperback reprinting many of the early Hammett/Raymond strips, with an introduction by [[Bill Blackbeard]]. In 1983, International Polygonics published a trade paperback edition ({{ISBN|0-930330-05-6}}) of the original Dashiell Hammett/Alex Raymond strips that included an additional story scripted by [[Leslie Charteris]] and a foreword by [[William F. Nolan]], author of ''Hammett: A Life on the Edge.'' In 1990, [[Kitchen Sink Press]] did a single volume reprint ({{ISBN|0-87816-077-9}}) of the Hammett/Raymond work on the strip.\n\n''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine has reprinted many of the George Evans and Goodwin/Williamson strips.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s imprint Library of American Comics published the Archie Goodwin/Al Williamson strips complete in five volumes.  A sixth volume collected strips by George Evans. In 2015, IDW published a volume with the Hammett/Raymond strips.\n\n==Media citations==\n* The ID of the Agency Director in the 1975 TV movie ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo: Identity Crisis]]'' states Phil Corrigan, Secret Agent X-9.\n* The rock band [[Modest Mouse]] released a song entitled and about Secret Agent X-9 on their album ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]''.\n* In [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', the character Franklin Hoenikker was known as Secret Agent X-9 in high school.\n* The animated television series ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' featured a [[film noir]] homage episode featuring robot assassin X9.\n* In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Roadwork]]'' Secret Agent X-9 is mentioned.\n* Former ''Secret Agent X-9'' writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], in his 1970s revival of DC Comics' ''[[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]'', tipped his hat to Agent Corrigan and to James Bond, by assigning the Manhunter character Interpol case-file number 007X9.\n* In \"Topsy Turvy World\", a third season story arc of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', the agent who picks up the protagonists for [[Peter Peachfuzz|Captain Peachfuzz]], now working at the Weather Bureau, is addressed as X-9.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/x-9.htm ''Secret Agent X-9''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

the small number of personnel in both the regiments.

L, ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Tatian''</ref> Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four [[gospel]]s\u2014[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]\u2014into a single coherent narrative of Jesus's life and death.  However, and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists, Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts; or to demonstrate that, as they stood, they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error.\n\nAlthough widely used by early Syriac Christians, the original text has not survived, but was reconstructed in 1881 by [[Theodor Zahn]] from translations and commentaries.<ref> [[Theodor Zahn]]: ''Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons und der altkirchlichen Literatur. Teil 1. Tatian\u2019s Diatessaron''. Deichert, Erlangen 1881.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTatian's harmony follows the gospels closely in terms of text but, in order to fit all the canonical material in, he created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] sequence and John's sequence; and occasionally creates intervening time periods that are found in none of the source accounts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFall, Leslie; \"Tatian's Diatessaron: Mischievous or Misleading?\"; Westminster Theological Journal, 56, 87\u2013114; 1994</ref> This sequence is coherent and consistent within itself, but not necessarily consistent with that in all or any of the separate canonical gospels; and Tatian apparently applies the same principle in respect of the narrative itself. Where the gospels differ from one another in respect of the details of an event or teaching, the Diatessaron resolves such apparent contradictions by selecting one or another alternative wording and adding consistent details from the other gospels; while omitting apparent duplicate matter, especially across the [[synoptic gospels|synoptics]]. Hence, in respect of [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the healing of the blind at Jericho]] the Diatessaron reports only one blind man, Bartimeaus, healed by Jesus when leaving the city according to the account in Mark 10:46ff (expanded with phrases from Luke 18:36\u201337); consequently omitting any separate mention of two unnamed blind men healed by Jesus leaving Jericho (Matthew 20:29ff), and also the healing by Jesus entering Jericho the previous day of a single unnamed blind man (Luke 18:35ff).<ref>Moore, G.F.; \"Tatian's Diatessaron and the analysis of the Pentateuch\"; Journal of Biblical Literature,9:2, 201\u2013215; 1890</ref>\n\nOtherwise, Tatian originally omitted altogether both of the different [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies]] in Matthew and Luke, as well as Luke's introduction (Luke 1:1\u20134);<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  and also did not originally include [[Pericope adulterae|Jesus' encounter with the adulteress]] (John 7:53\u20138:11). This latter passage is, however, generally considered to be a late addition to the Gospel of John,<ref>\"certainly not part of the original text,\" according to Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Pericope adulterae''.</ref> with the Diatessaron itself often cited as an early textual witness in support of its omission.  Most scholars agree that Tatian did, from the beginning, include the longer ending of Mark (Mark 16: 9\u201320), and correspondingly is amongst the earliest witnesses to this inclusion. Tatian added no significant wording to the textual material he took from the separate gospels.<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 9, Introduction to Diatessaron.</ref> Only 56 verses in the canonical Gospels do not have a counterpart in the Diatessaron, mostly the genealogies and the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''. The final work is about 72 per cent the length of the four gospels put together; around a quarter of the text of the separate gospels being adjudged by Tatian to be duplicated.  (McFall, 1994).\n\nIn the [[History of the Catholic Church|early Church]], the gospels at first circulated independently, with Matthew the most popular. The Diatessaron is notable evidence for the authority already enjoyed by the gospels by the mid- to late-2nd century.<ref name=\"Oxford:Diatessaron\">Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Diatessaron''</ref> Within twenty years after Tatian's harmony was written, [[Irenaeus]] was expressly arguing for the authoritative character of the Four Gospels. It is unclear whether Tatian intended the Diatessaron to supplement or replace the four separate gospels; but both outcomes came to pass in different churches. The Diatessaron became adopted as the standard [[lectionary]] text of the gospels in some Syriac-speaking churches from the late 2nd to the 5th century, until it gave way to the four separate Gospels such as the [[Syriac Sinaitic]] gospels,<ref name=\"Oxford:Diatessaron\" /> or later in the [[Peshitta]] version.<ref>Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Peshitta''</ref>  At the same time, in the churches of the Latin west, the Diatessaron circulated as a supplement to the four gospels, especially in the Latin translation.\n\n==Recensions==\nA number of [[recension]]s of the ''Diatessaron'' are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephrem's ''Commentary'' on Tatian's work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem's original [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text from the late 5th/early 6th century, which has been edited by [[Louis Leloir]] (Paris, 1966). Other translations include translations made into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Georgian language|Old Georgian]].<ref>This is taken from [[Tatian#Writings|the \"Writings\" section of the Wikipedia article on Tatian]].</ref>\n\n== Tatian's harmony ==\n[[File:Saint Justin Martyr by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tatian was a pupil of 2nd-century Christian convert, apologist, and philosopher [[Justin Martyr]]]]\n[[Tatian]] was an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] who was a pupil of [[Justin Martyr]] in [[Rome]], where, Justin says, the ''apomnemoneumata'' (recollections or memoirs) of the Apostles, the gospels, were read every Sunday. When Justin quotes the synoptic Gospels, he tends to do so in a harmonised form, and Helmut Koester and others conclude that Justin must have possessed a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Gospel harmony|harmony]] text of Matthew, Luke and Mark.\n\nIf so, it is unclear how much Tatian may have borrowed from this previous author in determining his own narrative sequence of Gospel elements. It is equally unclear whether Tatian took the Syriac Gospel texts composited into his Diatessaron from a previous translation, or whether the translation was his own. Where the Diatessaron records Gospel quotations from the Jewish Scriptures, the text appears to agree with that found in the Syriac [[Peshitta]] Old Testament rather than that found in the Greek [[Septuagint]]\u2014as used by the original Gospel authors. The majority consensus is that the Peshitta Old Testament preceded the Diatessaron, and represents an independent translation from the Hebrew Bible. Resolution of these scholarly questions remained very difficult so long as no complete version of the ''Diatessaron'' in Syriac or Greek had been recovered; while the medieval translations that had survived\u2014in [[Arabic]] and [[Latin]]\u2014both relied on texts that had been heavily corrected to conform better with later canonical versions of the separate Gospel texts.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\">W. B. Lockwood, Vernacular Scriptures in Germany and the Low Countries before 1500,  in The Cambridge History of the Bible, ed. G.W.H. Lampe, Cambridge University Press, 1969, p. 429.</ref>\n\nThere is scholarly uncertainty about what language Tatian used for its original composition, whether [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/>\n\n== Diatessaron in Syriac Christianity ==\n\nThe ''Diatessaron'' was used as the standard Gospel text in the liturgy of at least some sections of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian Church]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} for possibly up to two centuries {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} and was quoted or alluded to by Syrian writers. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] wrote a commentary on it, the Syriac original of which was rediscovered only in 1957, when a manuscript acquired by Sir [[Chester Beatty]] in 1957 (now Chester Beatty Syriac MS 709, Dublin) turned out to contain the text of Ephrem's commentary. The manuscript constituted approximately half of the leaves of a volume of Syriac writings that had been catalogued in 1952 in the library of the Coptic monastery of Deir es-Suriani in [[Wadi Natrun]], Egypt. Subsequently, the Chester Beatty library was able to track down and buy a further 42 leaves, so that now approximately eighty per cent of the Syriac commentary is available (McCarthy 1994). Ephrem did not comment on all passages in the Diatessaron, and nor does he always quote commentated passages in full; but for those phrases that he does quote, the commentary provides for the first time a dependable witness to Tatian's original; and also confirms its content and their sequence. [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-10/anf10-06.htm ].\n\n[[Theodoret]], bishop of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus on the Euphrates]] in [[Syria (region)|upper Syria]] in 423, suspecting Tatian of having been a heretic, sought out and found more than two hundred copies of the ''Diatessaron'', which he \"collected and put away, and introduced instead of them the Gospels of the four evangelists\".\n\n== Vernacular harmonies derived from the Diatessaron ==\n\nNo Christian tradition, other than some Syriac ones,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} has ever adopted a harmonized Gospel text for use in its liturgy. However, in many traditions, it was not unusual for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the [[vernacular]] of their own day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian's Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century [[Persian Language|Persian]] harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian's sequence exactly, but uses a source text corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac [[Peshitta]] Gospels;{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem's commentary.\n\nA [[Vetus Latina]] version of Tatian's Syriac text appears to have circulated in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely to that of the canonical [[Gospel of Luke]]; and also including additional canonical text (such as the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''), and possibly non-canonical matter from the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]. With the gradual adoption of the [[Vulgate]] as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/> In 546 [[Victor of Capua]] discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the [[Codex Fuldensis]], survives in the monastic library at [[Fulda]], where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in [[Old High German]], Eastern Frankish and [[Old Saxon]] (the alliterative poem '[[Heliand]]'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th\u201314th century Gospel harmonies in [[Middle Dutch]], [[Middle High German]], [[Middle French]], [[Middle English]], [[Italian Language|Tuscan]] and [[Italian Language|Venetian]]; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The [[Li\u00e8ge Diatessaron]] is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced [[Gospel of Barnabas]] (Joosten, 2002).\n\n== Names for the Gospel harmony ==\n\nThe title ''Diatessaron'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diatessar\u014dn'' (\"made of four [ingredients]\"), derived in turn from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd (''dia tessar\u014dn'') (\"out of four\"; i.e., ''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac]], dia'', \"at intervals of\" and ''tessar\u014dn'' [genitive of [[wikt:\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2|\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2]], ''tessares''], \"four\").\n\nThe Syriac name for this gospel harmony is '{{lang|syc|\u0710\u0718\u0722\u0713\u0720\u071d\u0718\u0722 \u0715\u0721\u071a\u0720\u071b\u0710}}' (Ewangeliy\u00f4n Damhallt\u00ea) meaning 'Gospel of the Mixed'.\n\n== Use of word \"God\" ==\n[[Robert F. Shedinger]] writes that in quotations citations to the Old Testament where the [[great uncial codices]] have  ''\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'', and the Hebrew manuscripts ''\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4'', Tatian wrote the term \"God\". P. D. Vasileiadis reports that \"Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century C.E., may provide additional confirmation of [[Howard\u2019s hypothesis]] (Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures, 136\u2013140).

L, ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Tatian''</ref> Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four [[gospel]]s\u2014[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]\u2014into a single coherent narrative of Jesus's life and death.  However, and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists, Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts; or to demonstrate that, as they stood, they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error.\n\nAlthough widely used by early Syriac Christians, the original text has not survived, but was reconstructed in 1881 by [[Theodor Zahn]] from translations and commentaries.<ref> [[Theodor Zahn]]: ''Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons und der altkirchlichen Literatur. Teil 1. Tatian\u2019s Diatessaron''. Deichert, Erlangen 1881.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTatian's harmony follows the gospels closely in terms of text but, in order to fit all the canonical material in, he created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] sequence and John's sequence; and occasionally creates intervening time periods that are found in none of the source accounts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFall, Leslie; \"Tatian's Diatessaron: Mischievous or Misleading?\"; Westminster Theological Journal, 56, 87\u2013114; 1994</ref> This sequence is coherent and consistent within itself, but not necessarily consistent with that in all or any of the separate canonical gospels; and Tatian apparently applies the same principle in respect of the narrative itself. Where the gospels differ from one another in respect of the details of an event or teaching, the Diatessaron resolves such apparent contradictions by selecting one or another alternative wording and adding consistent details from the other gospels; while omitting apparent duplicate matter, especially across the [[synoptic gospels|synoptics]]. Hence, in respect of [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the healing of the blind at Jericho]] the Diatessaron reports only one blind man, Bartimeaus, healed by Jesus when leaving the city according to the account in Mark 10:46ff (expanded with phrases from Luke 18:36\u201337); consequently omitting any separate mention of two unnamed blind men healed by Jesus leaving Jericho (Matthew 20:29ff), and also the healing by Jesus entering Jericho the previous day of a single unnamed blind man (Luke 18:35ff).<ref>Moore, G.F.; \"Tatian's Diatessaron and the analysis of the Pentateuch\"; Journal of Bilical Literature,9:2, 201\u2013215; 1890</ref>\n\nOtherwise, Tatian originally omitted altogether both of the different [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies]] in Matthew and Luke, as well as Luke's introduction (Luke 1:1\u20134);<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  and also did not originally include [[Pericope adulterae|Jesus' encounter with the adulteress]] (John 7:53\u20138:11). This latter passage is, however, generally considered to be a late addition to the Gospel of John,<ref>\"certainly not part of the original text,\" according to Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Pericope adulterae''.</ref> with the Diatessaron itself often cited as an early textual witness in support of its omission.  Most scholars agree that Tatian did, from the beginning, include the longer ending of Mark (Mark 16: 9\u201320), and correspondingly is amongst the earliest witnesses to this inclusion. Tatian added no significant wording to the textual material he took from the separate gospels.<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 9, Introduction to Diatessaron.</ref> Only 56 verses in the canonical Gospels do not have a counterpart in the Diatessaron, mostly the genealogies and the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''. The final work is about 72 per cent the length of the four gospels put together; around a quarter of the text of the separate gospels being adjudged by Tatian to be duplicated.  (McFall, 1994).\n\nIn the [[History of the Catholic Church|early Church]], the gospels at first circulated independently, with Matthew the most popular. The Diatessaron is notable evidence for the authority already enjoyed by the gospels by the mid- to late-2nd century.<ref name=\"Oxford:Diatessaron\">Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Diatessaron''</ref> Within twenty years after Tatian's harmony was written, [[Irenaeus]] was expressly arguing for the authoritative character of the Four Gospels. It is unclear whether Tatian intended the Diatessaron to supplement or replace the four separate gospels; but both outcomes came to pass in different churches. The Diatessaron became adopted as the standard [[lectionary]] text of the gospels in some Syriac-speaking churches from the late 2nd to the 5th century, until it gave way to the four separate Gospels such as the [[Syriac Sinaitic]] gospels,<ref name=\"Oxford:Diatessaron\" /> or later in the [[Peshitta]] version.<ref>Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Peshitta''</ref>  At the same time, in the churches of the Latin west, the Diatessaron circulated as a supplement to the four gospels, especially in the Latin translation.\n\n==Recensions==\nA number of [[recension]]s of the ''Diatessaron'' are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephrem's ''Commentary'' on Tatian's work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem's original [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text from the late 5th/early 6th century, which has been edited by [[Louis Leloir]] (Paris, 1966). Other translations include translations made into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Georgian language|Old Georgian]].<ref>This is taken from [[Tatian#Writings|the \"Writings\" section of the Wikipedia article on Tatian]].</ref>\n\n== Tatian's harmony ==\n[[File:Saint Justin Martyr by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tatian was a pupil of 2nd-century Christian convert, apologist, and philosopher [[Justin Martyr]]]]\n[[Tatian]] was an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] who was a pupil of [[Justin Martyr]] in [[Rome]], where, Justin says, the ''apomnemoneumata'' (recollections or memoirs) of the Apostles, the gospels, were read every Sunday. When Justin quotes the synoptic Gospels, he tends to do so in a harmonised form, and Helmut Koester and others conclude that Justin must have possessed a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Gospel harmony|harmony]] text of Matthew, Luke and Mark.\n\nIf so, it is unclear how much Tatian may have borrowed from this previous author in determining his own narrative sequence of Gospel elements. It is equally unclear whether Tatian took the Syriac Gospel texts composited into his Diatessaron from a previous translation, or whether the translation was his own. Where the Diatessaron records Gospel quotations from the Jewish Scriptures, the text appears to agree with that found in the Syriac [[Peshitta]] Old Testament rather than that found in the Greek [[Septuagint]]\u2014as used by the original Gospel authors. The majority consensus is that the Peshitta Old Testament preceded the Diatessaron, and represents an independent translation from the Hebrew Bible. Resolution of these scholarly questions remained very difficult so long as no complete version of the ''Diatessaron'' in Syriac or Greek had been recovered; while the medieval translations that had survived\u2014in [[Arabic]] and [[Latin]]\u2014both relied on texts that had been heavily corrected to conform better with later canonical versions of the separate Gospel texts.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\">W. B. Lockwood, Vernacular Scriptures in Germany and the Low Countries before 1500,  in The Cambridge History of the Bible, ed. G.W.H. Lampe, Cambridge University Press, 1969, p. 429.</ref>\n\nThere is scholarly uncertainty about what language Tatian used for its original composition, whether [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/>\n\n== Diatessaron in Syriac Christianity ==\n\nThe ''Diatessaron'' was used as the standard Gospel text in the liturgy of at least some sections of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian Church]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} for possibly up to two centuries {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} and was quoted or alluded to by Syrian writers. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] wrote a commentary on it, the Syriac original of which was rediscovered only in 1957, when a manuscript acquired by Sir [[Chester Beatty]] in 1957 (now Chester Beatty Syriac MS 709, Dublin) turned out to contain the text of Ephrem's commentary. The manuscript constituted approximately half of the leaves of a volume of Syriac writings that had been catalogued in 1952 in the library of the Coptic monastery of Deir es-Suriani in [[Wadi Natrun]], Egypt. Subsequently, the Chester Beatty library was able to track down and buy a further 42 leaves, so that now approximately eighty per cent of the Syriac commentary is available (McCarthy 1994). Ephrem did not comment on all passages in the Diatessaron, and nor does he always quote commentated passages in full; but for those phrases that he does quote, the commentary provides for the first time a dependable witness to Tatian's original; and also confirms its content and their sequence. [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-10/anf10-06.htm ].\n\n[[Theodoret]], bishop of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus on the Euphrates]] in [[Syria (region)|upper Syria]] in 423, suspecting Tatian of having been a heretic, sought out and found more than two hundred copies of the ''Diatessaron'', which he \"collected and put away, and introduced instead of them the Gospels of the four evangelists\".\n\n== Vernacular harmonies derived from the Diatessaron ==\n\nNo Christian tradition, other than some Syriac ones,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} has ever adopted a harmonized Gospel text for use in its liturgy. However, in many traditions, it was not unusual for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the [[vernacular]] of their own day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian's Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century [[Persian Language|Persian]] harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian's sequence exactly, but uses a source text corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac [[Peshitta]] Gospels;{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem's commentary.\n\nA [[Vetus Latina]] version of Tatian's Syriac text appears to have circulated in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely to that of the canonical [[Gospel of Luke]]; and also including additional canonical text (such as the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''), and possibly non-canonical matter from the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]. With the gradual adoption of the [[Vulgate]] as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/> In 546 [[Victor of Capua]] discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the [[Codex Fuldensis]], survives in the monastic library at [[Fulda]], where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in [[Old High German]], Eastern Frankish and [[Old Saxon]] (the alliterative poem '[[Heliand]]'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th\u201314th century Gospel harmonies in [[Middle Dutch]], [[Middle High German]], [[Middle French]], [[Middle English]], [[Italian Language|Tuscan]] and [[Italian Language|Venetian]]; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The [[Li\u00e8ge Diatessaron]] is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced [[Gospel of Barnabas]] (Joosten, 2002).\n\n== Names for the Gospel harmony ==\n\nThe title ''Diatessaron'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diatessar\u014dn'' (\"made of four [ingredients]\"), derived in turn from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd (''dia tessar\u014dn'') (\"out of four\"; i.e., ''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac]], dia'', \"at intervals of\" and ''tessar\u014dn'' [genitive of [[wikt:\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2|\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2]], ''tessares''], \"four\").\n\nThe Syriac name for this gospel harmony is '{{lang|syc|\u0710\u0718\u0722\u0713\u0720\u071d\u0718\u0722 \u0715\u0721\u071a\u0720\u071b\u0710}}' (Ewangeliy\u00f4n Damhallt\u00ea) meaning 'Gospel of the Mixed'.\n\n== Use of word \"God\" ==\n[[Robert F. Shedinger]] writes that in quotations citations to the Old Testament where the [[great uncial codices]] have  ''\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'', and the Hebrew manuscripts ''\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4'', Tatian wrote the term \"God\". P. D. Vasileiadis reports that \"Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century C.E., may provide additional confirmation of [[Howard\u2019s hypothesis]] (Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures, 136\u2013140). Additionally, within the [[Syriac Peshitta]] is discernible the distinction between \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 rendered as \u0710\u0733\u072a\u071d\u0733\u0721 (marya, which means \"lord\" and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and \u0722\u0730\u072a\u0733\u0721 (maran, a more generic term for \"lord\"; see Joh 21:7).\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}} R. F. Shedinger holds that after ''\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4'', ''\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2'' could be a term before \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 became the standard term in the New Testament Greek copies.{{sfn|Shedinger|2001|pp=138}}\n\nShedinger's work has been strongly criticized.

With the opening up of Bhutan in the early 1960s, a formal postal system was introduced. The American entrepreneur Burt Todd assisted in establishing a postage stamp program in the country<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/history.htm |title=Bhutan Stamps - History |publisher=Bhutanpostagestamps.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> and Bhutan became known for the unusual designs and materials of its stamps which were chosen by Todd specifically to attract attention. With the assistance of the Indian postal advisor Dr. K. Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J. Raymond, 'Bhutan New Postal Services Poses Several Questions', reprinted in ''The Great Wall'' (Quarterly of the China Stamp Collectors Club of Australasia), vol IV, no.1, October 1959</ref> Although disputed, the Finnish philatelist Iiro Kakko opines that the majority of the known covers sent to Kalimpong appear not to be genuine letters routed through the postal system, but especially produced for the philatelic market.<ref>Tshering Tashi, 'When revenue stamps served for postage', Kuensel Online 20 March 2011 (former link 'http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=18776'), also reprinted in Phila Mirror 15 April 2011 http://philamirror.info/2011/04/15/when-revenue-stamps-served-for-postage/ ; see also: Iiro Kakko, 'Bhutan - Dzong Dak Covers', in: Postal Himal no.85, 1st Quarter 1996, p. 17: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1996_002.pdf</ref>\n\n===Start of the modern era===\nWith the start of development programs in Bhutan and the end of its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of mail items, now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A. Nadybal, Bhutan Stamp Agency Problems Revealed, in: Postal Himal no.72, 4th Quarter 1992, pp 64-65: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1992_004.pdf</ref> After the death in 1972 of the 3rd [[Druk Gyalpo]], His Majesty [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], a good friend of Todd, one of the changes which took place was the cancellation of the contract of the Bhutan Stamp Agency end March 1974.<ref>Nildo Harper, Bhutan - A (continued) Brief Postal History, in: Postal Himal no.52, 4th Quarter 1987, p44: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1987_004.pdf</ref><ref>Brian Kuehl,'The Demise of the Bhutan Stamp Agency', in: 'The Kaleidoscope' (Bimonthly Publication of the Bhutan Philatelic Society) vol.1, no.2, July\u2013August 1976, pp 2-4</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Bhutanese stamps have tended to be more conventional with just the occasional unusual format. Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The sheet carries the text ''Coronation and Centenary Celebrations 2008''. The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15. Each stamp is framed, which provides a blank space for the printing of a personalized picture, drawing or logo. Bhutan Post used these 2008 Coronation and Centenary Celebrations personalized stamp sheets to issue 3 different sheets with pictures of the 4th and 5th (present) King and a stylized illustration of the Raven Crown. These stamps are listed in the Michel catalogue under nos. 2517 - 2528.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue. The sheetlet bears the text ''Celebrating Royal Wedding 2011'', while there is a picture of the newlywed couple as well. The face value of each of the four stamps in the three rows are from top to bottom, Nu.10, Nu.15 and Nu.20, so a total value of Nu.180. Further sheetlets with different designs were issued in 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2x in 2019.\n\n==Postal postage labels <ref>Leo van der Velden, Bhutan Post postal labels, in: Postal Himal #165, 1st Quarter 2016, pp10-16, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2016_001.pdf </ref>==\n[[File:Postal label domestic registered mail in Bhutan.jpg|thumb|Postal Label for domestic registered mail in Bhutan with separate registration bar code label]]\nBhutan Post uses postage labels for both regular and registered letters, and Express Mail Service (EMS). All postage labels will indicate date and time, the sending post office, place of addressee, weight of envelope, and costs of postage. EMS and registered letters also indicate name of receiver, EMS or registration tracking number and the registration fee. Registered letters and domestic EMS letters using a postal label, will also have a separate registration or EMS label with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding bar-code, while for international EMS covers this is part of the main label. Registered letters using ordinary postage stamps, will have an analog registration number, often written by hand on the envelope.\n\n==Revenue, legal and non-judicial stamps==\n[[File:Bhutanese revenue stamps used on legal document.jpg|thumb|left|Bhutanese revenue stamps of the 1950s used on a legal document]]\nBhutan has issued [[revenue stamp]]s in 1954, 1966/1967 and 1996. The first release consisted of four revenue stamps issued in 1954 in Tibetan currency: 1 trangka, blue; 2 trangka, red, 4 trangka, green and 8 trangka, orange. These stamps were also made valid for postage as of 1 January 1955 (see above \u2018Dzong Dak system and the use of fiscals as postage\u2019) until the introduction of the postage stamps in 1962, although they appear to have been postally used until at least 1964.<ref>Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, section Bhutan 'Postal-Fiscal Stamps'</ref> The set has been reprinted in the 1950s on paper that varies from the first printing in 1954, while also the colour ink may differ. A surcharged issue on the blue 1 trangka revenue stamp had been reportedly released in 1961 or 1962, diagonally surcharged respectively with \"10NP\" and \"25NP\" (NP standing for New Paisa, so using the Indian currency), but identified as fakes originating from Kathmandu, Nepal.<ref>Gobi Times , June 1970, pp 5-6, \u2018Further information on fiscal overprints\u2019</ref>\nOnly in 1966 was a new set of two revenue stamps  ready for release, now in Bhutanese currency, of 10 Chetrum (red colour) and 25 Chetrum (jade colour). They were released the next year, followed shortly after by the values 20 Chetrum, 1 Ngultrum and 5 Ngultrum.<ref>Brian G Vincent, The Revenue Stamps of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal, No. 163, 3rd Quarter 2015, pp12 - 15, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_003.pdf; Leo van der Velden & Iiro Kakko, Comments on Brian Vincent\u2019s article \u2018Revenue Stamps of Bhutan\u2019, in: Postal Himal, No. 165, 1st Quarter 2016, pp 6 - 8, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2016_001.pdf </ref> They were printed at the well-known Nasik Security Press in Nasik, India.

This left the front side free for writing of a message.\n\nThe next year P&T issued a simple, single postal card with a purple 10 Chhetrum imprinted stamp showing crossed dorjis or [[vajra]]s. At the same time a reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined single postcards. Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".  Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line.<ref>the size of the card is 100 x 180 mm with strip, and has the modern picture postcard size of 100 x 150 mm without</ref> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998.

The imprinted stamp is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the April 1998 WHO stamp set issued on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter. One type has the logo of the Silver Jubilee<ref>Bhutan Post issued for the same occasion a set of four stamps sheetlet and one souvenir sheet also showing the Silver Jubilee logo http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=121&category_id=11&manufacturer_id=0&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=26</ref>  at the middle left side, while the other type carries the same logo, slightly larger, in the left upper corner, covering also the place where the text \u2018Inland Letter\u2019 was printed originally; this text is now relocated to the upper middle, above the Silver Jubilee Free Post Campaign inscription.<ref>Len Nadybal, 2005, Catalogue of Bhutan Postal Stationery - Inland Letter Sheets http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Letter_Sheets.htm</ref>\n\n===Stamped Envelope===\n\n====The ''Free Post'' envelope to commemorate the Royal Wedding of 2011====\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding on 15 October 2011 of the Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk and the Gyaltsuen [[Jetsun Pema]] Wangchuck Bhutan Post organized Free Post Days on 13, 14 and 15 October 2011 for inland mail only.<ref>'Royal Wedding Bhutanese Style': http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.browse&category_id=15&Itemid=26</ref> Each post office received a limited number of Free Post envelopes to distribute among the public which they could use to send a letter within Bhutan for free during the three days of validity.\nThe Free Post [[stamped envelope]] is a white rectangular cover, regularly used by Bhutan Post, with printed in large capital black letters on the top front ''BHUTAN POSTAL CORPORATION LTD.''. The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years.

However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>.

With the assistance of the Indian postal advisor Dr. K. Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J.

The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A. Nadybal, Bhutan Stamp Agency Problems Revealed, in: Postal Himal no.72, 4th Quarter 1992, pp 64-65: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1992_004.pdf</ref> After the death in 1972 of the 3rd [[Druk Gyalpo]], His Majesty [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], a good friend of Todd, one of the changes which took place was the cancellation of the contract of the Bhutan Stamp Agency end March 1974.<ref>Nildo Harper, Bhutan - A (continued) Brief Postal History, in: Postal Himal no.52, 4th Quarter 1987, p44: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1987_004.pdf</ref><ref>Brian Kuehl,'The Demise of the Bhutan Stamp Agency', in: 'The Kaleidoscope' (Bimonthly Publication of the Bhutan Philatelic Society) vol.1, no.2, July\u2013August 1976, pp 2-4</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Bhutanese stamps have tended to be more conventional with just the occasional unusual format. Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The sheet carries the text ''Coronation and Centenary Celebrations 2008''. The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15. Each stamp is framed, which provides a blank space for the printing of a personalized picture, drawing or logo. Bhutan Post used these 2008 Coronation and Centenary Celebrations personalized stamp sheets to issue 3 different sheets with pictures of the 4th and 5th (present) King and a stylized illustration of the Raven Crown. These stamps are listed in the Michel catalogue under nos. 2517 - 2528.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue. The sheetlet bears the text ''Celebrating Royal Wedding 2011'', while there is a picture of the newlywed couple as well. The face value of each of the four stamps in the three rows are from top to bottom, Nu.10, Nu.15 and Nu.20, so a total value of Nu.180.

This left the front side free for writing of a message.\n\nThe next year P&T issued a simple, single postal card with a purple 10 Chhetrum imprinted stamp showing crossed dorjis or [[vajra]]s. At the same time a reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined single postcards. Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".  Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line.<ref>the size of the card is 100 x 180 mm with strip, and has the modern picture postcard size of 100 x 150 mm without</ref> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998. The folding letters, similar to an aerogramme, were mostly distributed free of charge by Bhutan Post to make the writing of letters popular.<ref>Karl-Heinz Michel, 'Bhutan Free Mail Campaign 1998 & 1999', in: Postal Himal no.126, 2nd Quarter 2006, p11-12 http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2006_002.pdf</ref> One carries the campaign slogans ''Let us produce a good relationship between parents and children through the exchange of letters'' in Dzongkha on the front and on the reverse in English ''Donate Blood,Save Lives''. The imprinted stamp is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the April 1998 WHO stamp set issued on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter. One type has the logo of the Silver Jubilee<ref>Bhutan Post issued for the same occasion a set of four stamps sheetlet and one souvenir sheet also showing the Silver Jubilee logo http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=121&category_id=11&manufacturer_id=0&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=26</ref>  at the middle left side, while the other type carries the same logo, slightly larger, in the left upper corner, covering also the place where the text \u2018Inland Letter\u2019 was printed originally; this text is now relocated to the upper middle, above the Silver Jubilee Free Post Campaign inscription.<ref>Len Nadybal, 2005, Catalogue of Bhutan Postal Stationery - Inland Letter Sheets http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Letter_Sheets.htm</ref>\n\n===Stamped Envelope===\n\n====The ''Free Post'' envelope to commemorate the Royal Wedding of 2011====\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding on 15 October 2011 of the Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk and the Gyaltsuen [[Jetsun Pema]] Wangchuck Bhutan Post organized Free Post Days on 13, 14 and 15 October 2011 for inland mail only.<ref>'Royal Wedding Bhutanese Style': http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.browse&category_id=15&Itemid=26</ref> Each post office received a limited number of Free Post envelopes to distribute among the public which they could use to send a letter within Bhutan for free during the three days of validity.\nThe Free Post [[stamped envelope]] is a white rectangular cover, regularly used by Bhutan Post, with printed in large capital black letters on the top front ''BHUTAN POSTAL CORPORATION LTD.''. The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years. Recently they resurfaced on Facebook as ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors''.<ref>see the Facebook page of ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors'' at https://www.facebook.com/groups/129173790434880/</ref> The [[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]] provides also a haven for collectors of Bhutanese stamps and Bhutan philately receives regular attention in their publication ''Postal Himal''.<ref>the NTPSC website is hosted by Rainer's Stamp Corner http://fuchs-online.com/ntpsc , while digital copies of their publication Postal Himal can be found on the website of the Digital Himalaya Project co-located at the Cambridge and Yale universities http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/postalhimal</ref>\n\n==Catalogues and publications==\nA specific stamp catalogue for Bhutan does not exist at the moment. However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>. The postal museum narrates the story of the evolution of communication, transportation and postal services in Bhutan's history. The story is told through the collection of various anecdotes, artifacts and the rich assortment of stamps Bhutan has produced over the years<ref> Bhutan Postal Museum website http://www.bhutanpostalmuseum.bt/ </ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people on stamps of Bhutan]]\n*[[Bhutan Postal Corporation]]\n*[[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Bhutan through postage stamps''.
