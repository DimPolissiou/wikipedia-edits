Originally designated the '''F11F Tiger''' in April 1955 under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|pre-1962 Navy designation system]], it was redesignated as '''F-11 Tiger''' under the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]].\n\nThe F11F/F-11 was used by the [[Blue Angels]] [[aerobatics|flight team]] from 1957\u20131969. [[Grumman]] Aircraft Corporation made 200 Tigers, with the last aircraft being delivered to the U.S. Navy on 23 January 1959.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:XF11F-1 F9F-9 NAN1-55.jpg|thumb|right|XF9F-9 prototype]]\n[[File:F11F-1 Tiger on USS Forrestal (CVA-59) in April 1956.jpg|thumb|An F11F-1 Tiger on USS Forrestal (CVA-59) in April 1956, with downward-folded wingtips]]\n[[File:F11F short and long nose at NAS Kingsville.jpg|thumb|An early production \"short nose\" F11F and a later \"long nose\" from VT-23]]\n\nThe F11F (F-11) Tiger origins can be traced back to a privately funded 1952 Grumman concept to modernize the [[Grumman F-9 Cougar|F9F-6/7 Cougar]] by implementing the [[area rule]] and other advances. This Grumman company project was named ''G-98'', and when it was concluded it was a complete design departure from the Cougar.\n\nThe design's potential for supersonic performance and reduced transonic drag stirred interest in the U.S. Navy. By 1953, redesigns led to a completely new aircraft bearing no more than a familial resemblance to the Cougar. The new wing had full-span [[leading edge slats]] and trailing edge [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s with roll control achieved using [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s rather than traditional [[aileron]]s. For storage on aircraft carriers, the F-11 Tiger's wings manually folded downwards. Anticipating [[supersonic]] performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed for the [[Wright J65]] [[turbojet]], a license-built version of the [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1973/Sep73.pdf \"Naval Aircraft: Tiger.\"] ''Naval Aviation News'' (U.S. Navy), September 1973, pp.&nbsp;20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] was sufficiently impressed to order two prototypes, designated ''XF9F-8'' even though the new fighter was clearly a new design. To add to the confusion, the prototypes were then redesignated ''XF9F-9'' with the XF9F-8 designation going to another more straightforward Cougar derivative. Since the [[afterburner|afterburning]] version of the J65 was not ready, the first prototype flew on 30 July 1954 with a non-afterburning engine. In spite of this, the aircraft nearly reached [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 in its maiden flight. The second prototype, equipped with the afterburning engine, became the second supersonic U.S. Navy aircraft, the first being the [[Douglas F4D Skyray]]. In April 1955, the aircraft received the new designation F11F-1 (F-11A after adoption of the unified [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|Tri-Service naming system]] in 1962). Carrier trials started on 4 April 1956 when an F11F-1 Tiger landed on and launched from {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}.<ref>Bowers 1990, p. 256.</ref>\n\nThe F-11 Tiger is noted for being the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down.<ref name=\"AIJun91 p318\">Spick ''Air International'' June 1991, p. 318.</ref> On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20&nbsp;mm (0.79&nbsp;in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the [[trajectory]] of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.<ref>[http://www.aerofiles.com/tiger-tail.html \"A Tiger Bites Its Tail.\"] ''Aerofiles''.

Retrieved: 1 April 2007.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the F-11A (F11F-1) fighter, Grumman also proposed a more advanced version of the airframe known as the [[Grumman F11F-1F Super Tiger|F11F-1F Super Tiger]]. This was the result of a 1955 study to fit the new [[General Electric J79]] engine into the F11F-1 airframe.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:F11F-1 VF-21 CVA-61 1957.jpeg|thumb|right|F11F-1 of VF-21 landing on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}} in 1957]]\n[[File:Grumman F-11A 141829 VT-26 DM 22.04.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|F-11A Tiger advanced trainer of VT-26 Squadron wearing the distinctive color scheme used by that variant]]\n\nSeven U.S. Navy squadrons flew the F11F-1: VF-21 and VF-33 in the Atlantic Fleet and VA-156 (redesignated VF-111 in January 1959), VF-24 (redesignated VF-211 in March 1959), VF-51, VF-121, and VF-191 in the Pacific Fleet.<ref name=\"AIJun91 p318\"/>\n\nIn service, the Tiger operated from the carriers {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}, {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|2}}, {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|2}}, {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}}. The F11F's career lasted only four years because its performance was inferior to the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]] and the J65 engine proved unreliable. Also, the range and endurance of the ''Tiger'' was found to be inadequate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Thus, the Navy cancelled all orders for the ''F11F-1P'' reconnaissance version and only 199 F11F-1 (F-11A) fighters were built.\n\nThe aircraft was withdrawn from carrier operations by 1961. It continued in service, however, in the Naval Air Training Command in [[south Texas]] at [[Beeville, Texas|NAS Chase Field]] and [[NAS Kingsville]], until the late 1960s. Students performed advanced jet training in the [[Grumman F-9 Cougar|TF-9J Cougar]], and upon completing that syllabus, were given a brief taste of supersonic capability with the F-11 before transitioning to fleet fighters.<ref name= \"Baugher\"/>\n\nWhile the F-11's fighter career was short, the [[Blue Angels]] performed in the aircraft from 1957\u20131968, when the Tiger was replaced by the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]].<ref>[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/aircraft/historical.aspx \"Historical Aircraft of the Blue Angels\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419102617/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/aircraft/historical.aspx |date=2012-04-19}} ''Blue Angels.''

BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries thrust reverser and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a [[chase plane]]. Tests of the inflight [[thrust reverser|thrust reversal]] were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|NATC Patuxent River]], Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB.

Originally designated the '''F11F Tiger''' in April 1955 under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|pre-1962 Navy designation system]], it was redesignated as '''F-11 Tiger''' under the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]].\n\nThe F11F/F-11 was used by the [[Blue Angels]] [[aerobatics|flight team]] from 1957\u20131969. [[Grumman]] Aircraft Corporation made 200 Tigers, with the last aircraft being delivered to the U.S. Navy on 23 January 1959.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:XF11F-1 F9F-9 NAN1-55.jpg|thumb|right|XF9F-9 prototype]]\n[[File:F11F-1 Tiger on USS Forrestal (CVA-59) in April 1956.jpg|thumb|An F11F-1 Tiger on USS Forrestal (CVA-59) in April 1956, with downward-folded wingtips]]\n[[File:F11F short and long nose at NAS Kingsville.jpg|thumb|An early production \"short nose\" F11F and a later \"long nose\" from VT-23]]\n\nThe F11F (F-11) Tiger origins can be traced back to a privately funded 1952 Grumman concept to modernize the [[Grumman F-9 Cougar|F9F-6/7 Cougar]] by implementing the [[area rule]] and other advances. This Grumman company project was named ''G-98'', and when it was concluded it was a complete design departure from the Cougar.\n\nThe design's potential for supersonic performance and reduced transonic drag stirred interest in the U.S. Navy. By 1953, redesigns led to a completely new aircraft bearing no more than a familial resemblance to the Cougar. The new wing had full-span [[leading edge slats]] and trailing edge [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s with roll control achieved using [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s rather than traditional [[aileron]]s. For storage on aircraft carriers, the F-11 Tiger's wings manually folded downwards. Anticipating [[supersonic]] performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed for the [[Wright J65]] [[turbojet]], a license-built version of the [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1973/Sep73.pdf \"Naval Aircraft: Tiger.\"] ''Naval Aviation News'' (U.S. Navy), September 1973, pp.&nbsp;20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] was sufficiently impressed to order two prototypes, designated ''XF9F-8'' even though the new fighter was clearly a new design. To add to the confusion, the prototypes were then redesignated ''XF9F-9'' with the XF9F-8 designation going to another more straightforward Cougar derivative. Since the [[afterburner|afterburning]] version of the J65 was not ready, the first prototype flew on 30 July 1954 with a non-afterburning engine. In spite of this, the aircraft nearly reached [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 in its maiden flight. The second prototype, equipped with the afterburning engine, became the second supersonic U.S. Navy aircraft, the first being the [[Douglas F4D Skyray]]. In April 1955, the aircraft received the new designation F11F-1 (F-11A after adoption of the unified [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|Tri-Service naming system]] in 1962). Carrier trials started on 4 April 1956 when an F11F-1 Tiger landed on and launched from {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}.<ref>Bowers 1990, p. 256.</ref>\n\nThe F-11 Tiger is noted for being the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down.<ref name=\"AIJun91 p318\">Spick ''Air International'' June 1991, p. 318.</ref> On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20&nbsp;mm (0.79&nbsp;in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the [[trajectory]] of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.<ref>[http://www.aerofiles.com/tiger-tail.html \"A Tiger Bites Its Tail.\"] ''Aerofiles''.

Retrieved: 1 April 2007.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the F-11A (F11F-1) fighter, Grumman also proposed a more advanced version of the airframe known as the [[Grumman F11F-1F Super Tiger|F11F-1F Super Tiger]]. This was the result of a 1955 study to fit the new [[General Electric J79]] engine into the F11F-1 airframe.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:F11F-1 VF-21 CVA-61 1957.jpeg|thumb|right|F11F-1 of VF-21 landing on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}} in 1957]]\n[[File:Grumman F-11A 141829 VT-26 DM 22.04.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|F-11A Tiger advanced trainer of VT-26 Squadron wearing the distinctive color scheme used by that variant]]\n\nSeven U.S. Navy squadrons flew the F11F-1: VF-21 and VF-33 in the Atlantic Fleet and VA-156 (redesignated VF-111 in January 1959), VF-24 (redesignated VF-211 in March 1959), VF-51, VF-121, and VF-191 in the Pacific Fleet.<ref name=\"AIJun91 p318\"/>\n\nIn service, the Tiger operated from the carriers {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}, {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|2}}, {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|2}}, {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|2}}, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}}. The F11F's career lasted only four years because its performance was inferior to the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]] and the J65 engine proved unreliable. Also, the range and endurance of the ''Tiger'' was found to be inadequate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Thus, the Navy cancelled all orders for the ''F11F-1P'' reconnaissance version and only 199 F11F-1 (F-11A) fighters were built.\n\nThe aircraft was withdrawn from carrier operations by 1961. It continued in service, however, in the Naval Air Training Command in [[south Texas]] at [[Beeville, Texas|NAS Chase Field]] and [[NAS Kingsville]], until the late 1960s. Students performed advanced jet training in the [[Grumman F-9 Cougar|TF-9J Cougar]], and upon completing that syllabus, were given a brief taste of supersonic capability with the F-11 before transitioning to fleet fighters.<ref name= \"Baugher\"/>\n\nWhile the F-11's fighter career was short, the [[Blue Angels]] performed in the aircraft from 1957\u20131968, when the Tiger was replaced by the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]].<ref>[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/aircraft/historical.aspx \"Historical Aircraft of the Blue Angels\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419102617/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/aircraft/historical.aspx |date=2012-04-19}} ''Blue Angels.'' Retrieved: 30 August 2012.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|1962 code unification]], the fighter was known as the F11F; after unification, it was redesignated F-11.\n\nIn 1973, two former Blue Angels F-11As were taken from storage at [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AFB]] and modified by Grumman as [[testbed]]s to evaluate in-flight thrust control systems. BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries thrust reverser and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a [[chase plane]]. Tests of the inflight [[thrust reverser|thrust reversal]] were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|NATC Patuxent River]], Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode.

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]].

Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question?

Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

{"title_page": "Dead Dog Beach", "text_new": "{{short description|Beach in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2019}}\n\n'''Dead Dog Beach''', also known as '''Sato Beach''' and officially named '''Playa Lucia''', is a beach within the municipality of [[Yabucoa]] in southeastern [[Puerto Rico]]. Its \"Dead Dog Beach\" came because it is the dumping ground for stray animals, mainly dogs that the inhabitants of Yabucoa can no longer afford. Most are not [[spayed]] or [[neutered]]; in [[Puerto Rican culture]], cutting a dog's \"manhood\" is seen as inappropriate/cruel. The strays [[breed]] uncontrollably, giving rise to more homeless dogs.\n\nDead Dog Beach was known for one of the highest concentrations of stray animals in the country. It attracted [[animal rights activist]]s and groups hoping to make a difference. One example is The Sato Project, a large-scale [[rescue]] project focusing its efforts on Sato Beach/Yabucoa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesatoproject.org/|title=The Sato Project|website=The Sato Project|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Many individuals who come are so moved by these animals' living conditions that they extend their stay and help. Various rescue projects focus on the island's development. Many of these efforts were prompted by abuse of animals, even by local authorities, as in the Barceloneta Massacre in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-than-50-pets-massacred-in-puerto-rico/|title=More Than 50 Pets Massacred In Puerto Rico|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[Puerto Rico]], mainly a 90-by-30 mile island located in the [[Caribbean]] region, includes smaller islands off of its eastern coast. Its average temperatures range from 70-80 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Its beaches stretch for hundreds of miles.<ref>Barreto, Maritza (2017). Assessment of beach morphology at Puerto Rico Island. Puerto Rico and Caribbean Beach Network. retrieved from: http://drna.pr.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Geomorphic-Assessment-of-Puerto-Rico-1977-to-2016.pdf</ref> Along the northern coasts, are cliffs and a region known as the [[Karst]] region. This region contains notable land features such as caves, caverns, waterfalls, underground rivers and rain forests. Puerto Rico has the largest and deepest trench in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], known as the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].<ref name=Landforms>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/puertorico/prland.htm|title=Geography of Puerto Rico, Landforms - World Atlas|website=www.worldatlas.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref> Notable rivers include the [[Guayan\u00e9s River (Yabucoa, Puerto Rico)|Guayanes River]] extends for 17 miles, as well as the [[Prieto River (Ponce, Puerto Rico)|Prieto]], [[Arenas River (Yabucoa, Puerto Rico)|Arenas]], [[Limones River|Limones]] and [[Ingenio River|Ingenio Rivers]].<ref name=enciclopediapr>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=09052002|title=Municipalities: Yabucoa|website=www.enciclopediapr.org|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref>\n\nYabucoa is surrounded on three sides by the San Lorenzo Batholith and the Caribbean Sea. It is [[humid]] and mainly flat. Mountain ranges in this area include Santa Elena peak, Pandura, and the Cayey Range.  Yabucoa valley consists mainly of farmland. It was originally a small mountain town.<ref name=enciclopediapr/>\n\n== History ==\nThe name [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico|Yubucoa]] means \"place or site with waters\", although some scholars believe it means \"place of cassava\".<ref name=enciclopediapr/> The area was founded in 1793 when Manuel Col\u00f3n de Bonillas and his wife, Catalina Morales Pacheco, donated the settlement.<ref name=enciclopediapr/> [[Puerto Rico]] was a [[Spanish colony]] until 1898, when it became a U.S. territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html|title=Central America :: Puerto Rico \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> Economic hardship dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Although briefly resolved, such hardships play a key role in the story of Dead Dog Beach. Yabucoa received popularity when in 1989 the [[WBO]] held a boxing championship there between [[Orlando Fernandez]] and [[Julio Gervacio]]. Fernandez' victory brought attention to the town and to Puerto Rico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fightsrec.com/orlando-fernandez.html|title=Orlando Fernandez boxer|website=www.fightsrec.com|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref>\n\nBefore becoming known as \"Dead Dog Beach,\" Playa Lucia was once a popular beach.

Its \"Dead Dog Beach\" came because it is the dumping ground for stray animals, mainly dogs that the inhabitants of Yabucoa can no longer afford. Most are not [[spayed]] or [[neutered]]; in [[Puerto Rican culture]], cutting a dog's \"manhood\" is seen as inappropriate/cruel. The strays [[breed]] uncontrollably, giving rise to more homeless dogs.\n\nDead Dog Beach was known for one of the highest concentrations of stray animals in the country. It attracted [[animal rights activist]]s and groups hoping to make a difference. One example is The Sato Project, a large-scale [[rescue]] project focusing its efforts on Sato Beach/Yabucoa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesatoproject.org/|title=The Sato Project|website=The Sato Project|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Many individuals who come are so moved by these animals' living conditions that they extend their stay and help. Various rescue projects focus on the island's development.

[[File:Coggin College and lake UNF.JPG|right|thumb| View of the college from the Student Union Boathouse.]] Undergraduates pursue the Bachelor of Business Administration degree, for which various major and minor fields of study are offered.\n\nGraduates have available three different degree programs. The [[Master of Accountancy]] program is designed to prepare students for public accounting careers, providing enough credit hours to sit for state CPA exams. The [[Master of Science in Management]] program is a generalist business degree with a focus on management.  The [[Masters of Business Administration]] program is designed to prepare students to take on advanced leadership roles in business organizations by synthesizing various business disciplines into management strategy. \n\nThe MBA program curriculum is structured around three groupings of core subject classes including marketing, management, finance, accounting, and economics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unf.edu/catalog/link/CCB-MBABBUS/ |title=Curicculum |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=unf.edu |publisher=unf |access-date=4 March 2016 |quote=}}</ref>  In addition three elective courses are taken.  Students have the option to use these electives to concentrate in an area of study, such as further study in core subjects or other areas for example, international business, but are not required to.  All core courses are offered in the fall, spring, and summer; electives are generally offered only in the spring and fall.  The MBA program maintains a balance in instruction methods utilizing lecture, [[Case method|case studies]], and group based projects such as simulations.  \n\nIn addition to these programs Coggin offers a graduate certificate in e-Business.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unf.edu/coggin/academics/graduate/certificates.aspx |title=Certificates |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=unf.edu |publisher=unf |access-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307062002/https://www.unf.edu/coggin/academics/graduate/certificates.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Student Organizations==\nThe Osprey Financial Group is the college's student managed investment fund.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations.

Trump praised his administration's response to the \"foreign\" virus while stating that \"a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\" He closed the speech by calling for less partisanship during the pandemic and praising Americans' response to adversity.<ref>{{cite news |title='Tough Measures': Text of Trump's Address on Coronavirus |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/tough-measures-text-of-trumps-address-on-coronavirus |accessdate=16 April 2020 |agency=AP |publisher=U.S. News & World Report |date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hohmann |first1=James |title=Clarifications after Trump's Oval Office address are emblematic of his uneven coronavirus response |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/03/12/daily-202-clarifications-after-trump-s-oval-office-address-are-emblematic-of-his-uneven-coronavirus-response/5e69c2b988e0fa101a7475b1/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> After the WHO announced a 3.4% mortality rate for the cases on March 13,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus|title=Coronavirus facts: is there a cure and what is the mortality rate of the virus?|last1=Devlin|first1=Hannah|last2=Boseley|first2=Sarah|date=13 March 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Trump remarked on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Hannity]]'' that this was a \"false number\" and the true figure was under 1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/trump-coronavirus-who-global-death-rate-false-number|title=Trump calls WHO's global death rate from coronavirus 'a false number'|last1=Walters|first1=Joanna|last2=Aratani|first2=Lauren|date=5 March 2020|work=The Guardian|last3=Beaumont|first3=Peter}}</ref> On March 13, Trump declared the coronavirus to be a national emergency, freeing up $50 billion in federal funds to fight the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/donald-trump-emergency/index.html|title=Trump declares national emergency\u2014and denies responsibility for coronavirus testing failures|last=Liptak|first=Kevin|date=March 13, 2020|work=CNN|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, Trump changed his tone on the outbreak to a somber one.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations.

Trump praised his administration's response to the \"foreign\" virus while stating that \"a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\" He closed the speech by calling for less partisanship during the pandemic and praising Americans' response to adversity.<ref>{{cite news |title='Tough Measures': Text of Trump's Address on Coronavirus |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/tough-measures-text-of-trumps-address-on-coronavirus |accessdate=16 April 2020 |agency=AP |publisher=U.S. News & World Report |date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hohmann |first1=James |title=Clarifications after Trump's Oval Office address are emblematic of his uneven coronavirus response |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/03/12/daily-202-clarifications-after-trump-s-oval-office-address-are-emblematic-of-his-uneven-coronavirus-response/5e69c2b988e0fa101a7475b1/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> After the WHO announced a 3.4% mortality rate for the cases on March 13,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus|title=Coronavirus facts: is there a cure and what is the mortality rate of the virus?|last1=Devlin|first1=Hannah|last2=Boseley|first2=Sarah|date=13 March 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Trump remarked on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Hannity]]'' that this was a \"false number\" and the true figure was under 1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/trump-coronavirus-who-global-death-rate-false-number|title=Trump calls WHO's global death rate from coronavirus 'a false number'|last1=Walters|first1=Joanna|last2=Aratani|first2=Lauren|date=5 March 2020|work=The Guardian|last3=Beaumont|first3=Peter}}</ref> On March 13, Trump declared the coronavirus to be a national emergency, freeing up $50 billion in federal funds to fight the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/donald-trump-emergency/index.html|title=Trump declares national emergency\u2014and denies responsibility for coronavirus testing failures|last=Liptak|first=Kevin|date=March 13, 2020|work=CNN|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, Trump changed his tone on the outbreak to a somber one.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

One day Stevie bikes past Motor Avenue Skateshop, admires the boastful camaraderie of the skateboarders outside, and returns the following day. Back home, he trades with his brother for a skateboard, brings it to the shop and befriends young skater Ruben, who introduces him to the rest of the group: Ray, \"Fuckshit\", and \"Fourth Grade\". Although an inexperienced skater, Stevie is drawn to the group and aspires to imitate their [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] behavior and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] attitudes. b\n\nWhile attempting a skateboard leap across an open section between two rooftops, Stevie falls and suffers a head injury. Dabney becomes concerned about his turn towards recklessness and his new friends, but Stevie has already made up his mind that he is sticking with the group. Ian has a tense standoff with Fuckshit as Stevie watches, but Ian appears intimidated by the group and leaves before a fight can break out. Stevie begins smoking, drinking, and experimenting with [[marijuana]]. At a party, he has his first sexual experience.\n\nAfter Stevie comes home intoxicated, he and Ian get into a violent fight. Ian has an emotional breakdown when Stevie says that he has no friends and, following the conflict, a distressed Stevie attempts to [[Asphyxia|asphyxiate]] himself with a cord from a [[Super Nintendo]] controller, one of several self-harm incidents. The next day, Dabney forbids Stevie from hanging out with the boys. Stevie lashes out and refuses to obey. Having alienated his mother and brother, Stevie sits alone behind the skate shop. Ray consoles Stevie, telling him that even though he thinks his life is bad, the other boys have it worse: Fourth Grade is poor to the point of not being able to afford socks, Ruben's mom is a drug addict, Fuckshit's reckless partying is worsening, and Ray lost his younger brother, who was hit by a car. Ray then takes Stevie out to skate at night and they fall asleep in a park.\n\nThe shop hosts a party in back of the store. Ray hopes to make a career in skating, and chats up two professionals as potential sponsors. Fuckshit, who is drunk and high, tries to sabotage Ray's chances by embarrassing him in front of the pros. Stevie, who has been drinking heavily, is provoked into a brawl with Ruben. Discouraged by the undisciplined behavior of his friends, Ray tells everyone to go home. However, Fuckshit insists on driving the group to another party. Ray reluctantly agrees, and the group head off, with Stevie riding shotgun. No one seems happy except Fuckshit, whose judgment has been impaired by drugs and alcohol. Talking animatedly and driving inattentively, Fuckshit crashes and flips the car on its side. Stevie is knocked unconscious and is rushed to the hospital. \n\nStevie later awakens in a hospital bed, and sees Ian in a chair alongside him. Ian gives Stevie a container of orange juice to comfort his little brother. Dabney enters the hospital and sees Stevie's friends, asleep in the waiting room.

One day Stevie bikes past Motor Avenue Skateshop, admires the boastful camaraderie of the skateboarders outside, and returns the following day. Back home, he trades with his brother for a skateboard, brings it to the shop and befriends young skater Ruben, who introduces him to the rest of the group: Ray, \"Fuckshit\", and \"Fourth Grade\". Although an inexperienced skater, Stevie is drawn to the group and aspires to imitate their [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] behavior and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] attitudes. Stevie is nicknamed \"Sunburn\" by Ray during a conversation, and his acceptance into the group causes Ruben to resent him.\n\nWhile attempting a skateboard leap across an open section between two rooftops, Stevie falls and suffers a head injury. Dabney becomes concerned about his turn towards recklessness and his new friends, but Stevie has already made up his mind that he is sticking with the group. Ian has a tense standoff with Fuckshit as Stevie watches, but Ian appears intimidated by the group and leaves before a fight can break out. Stevie begins smoking, drinking, and experimenting with [[marijuana]]. At a party, he has his first sexual experience.\n\nAfter Stevie comes home intoxicated, he and Ian get into a violent fight. Ian has an emotional breakdown when Stevie says that he has no friends and, following the conflict, a distressed Stevie attempts to [[Asphyxia|asphyxiate]] himself with a cord from a [[Super Nintendo]] controller, one of several self-harm incidents. The next day, Dabney forbids Stevie from hanging out with the boys. Stevie lashes out and refuses to obey. Having alienated his mother and brother, Stevie sits alone behind the skate shop. Ray consoles Stevie, telling him that even though he thinks his life is bad, the other boys have it worse: Fourth Grade is poor to the point of not being able to afford socks, Ruben's mom is a drug addict, Fuckshit's reckless partying is worsening, and Ray lost his younger brother, who was hit by a car. Ray then takes Stevie out to skate at night and they fall asleep in a park.\n\nThe shop hosts a party in back of the store. Ray hopes to make a career in skating, and chats up two professionals as potential sponsors. Fuckshit, who is drunk and high, tries to sabotage Ray's chances by embarrassing him in front of the pros. Stevie, who has been drinking heavily, is provoked into a brawl with Ruben. Discouraged by the undisciplined behavior of his friends, Ray tells everyone to go home. However, Fuckshit insists on driving the group to another party. Ray reluctantly agrees, and the group head off, with Stevie riding shotgun. No one seems happy except Fuckshit, whose judgment has been impaired by drugs and alcohol. Talking animatedly and driving inattentively, Fuckshit crashes and flips the car on its side. Stevie is knocked unconscious and is rushed to the hospital. \n\nStevie later awakens in a hospital bed, and sees Ian in a chair alongside him. Ian gives Stevie a container of orange juice to comfort his little brother. Dabney enters the hospital and sees Stevie's friends, asleep in the waiting room. Moved by the fact they are there for Stevie, Dabney encourages them to visit Stevie's room. They appear willing to reconcile with each other after the previous night's events. Fourth Grade, who has been filming their adventures throughout the film, says he has something to show them. He plugs his camera into a TV to play them an edited video of their daily activities. Fourth Grade has titled the film \"''Mid90s''.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sunny Suljic]] as Stevie \"Sunburn\"\n* [[Na-Kel Smith]] as Ray\n* Olan Prenatt as Fuckshit\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Ian, Stevie's brother\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Dabney, Ian and Stevie's mother\n* Gio Galicia as Ruben\n* Ryder McLaughlin as Fourth Grade\n* [[Alexa Demie]] as Estee\nAdditionally, [[Jerrod Carmichael]] cameos as a security guard whom Stevie and his friends taunt.
