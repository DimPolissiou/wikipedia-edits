It addresses themes such as political socialization, protest activity, political participation, participation in political parties, trade unions and social movements, lobbying and interest groups. CRAPUL has grown ever since its creation in September 2002, especially regarding conferences, the launching of collective research projects and a new series in social sciences at a Swiss publisher.\n\nFillieule's main fields of research and publication refer to social movements theories, the sociology of militantism and political activism, interactionist approaches, commitment and disengagement, gender approaches to social movements and activism, collective behavior, demonstrations, maintenance of order, police and repression and protests and mobilizations against AIDS, therapeutical activism, commitment in vaccine trials.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{underlinked|section|date=August 2017}}\n*(With Eric Agrikoliansky and Isabelle Sommier) (eds.), Penser les mouvements sociaux, Conflits sociaux et contestation dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s contemporaines, Paris, La D\u00e9couverte.\n*(With Lilian Mathieu and C\u00e9cile P\u00e9chu) (eds.), Dictionnaire des mouvements sociaux, Paris, Presses de Sciences Po, 2009.\n*(With Patricia Roux) (eds.), Le sexe du militantisme, Paris, Presses de Sciences Po, 2009.\n*Fillieule, Olivier, Danielle Tartakowsky, La manifestation de rue, Paris, Presses de Sciences po, coll.

Nevertheless, the administration of the [[political left|left]]-leaning President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.<ref>[[Barcelona Centre for International Affairs]], Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2</ref>\n\nLusinchi's political party, the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]], was able to remain in power following the [[Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1988|1988 election]] of [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]] as president. P\u00e9rez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. P\u00e9rez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during P\u00e9rez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011</ref>\n\nMeasures taken by P\u00e9rez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25-26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.<ref name=\"margarita_l_m_2003_p120-1\" >Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, 2003. \"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', Vol.35, No.1 (2003), pp 120-121 (See #Further reading).</ref>\n\nAccording to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Pe\u00f1aloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by [[Fidel Castro]], and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.<ref name=\"DELFINcoro\">{{cite book|last1=Pe\u00f1aloza|first1=General Carlos|title=El Delf\u00edn de Fidel: La historia oculta tras el golpe del 4F|date=2014|isbn=1505750334|page=185|quote=On February 5, 1989, the transmission of Lusinchi's command to P\u00e9rez was effected with a lavish ceremony unprecedented in a democracy.

Nevertheless, the administration of the [[political left|left]]-leaning President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.<ref>[[Barcelona Centre for International Affairs]], Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2</ref>\n\nLusinchi's political party, the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]], was able to remain in power following the [[Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1988|1988 election]] of [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]] as president. P\u00e9rez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. P\u00e9rez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during P\u00e9rez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011</ref>\n\nMeasures taken by P\u00e9rez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25-26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.<ref name=\"margarita_l_m_2003_p120-1\" >Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, 2003. \"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', Vol.35, No.1 (2003), pp 120-121 (See #Further reading).</ref>\n\nAccording to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Pe\u00f1aloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by [[Fidel Castro]], and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.<ref name=\"DELFINcoro\">{{cite book|last1=Pe\u00f1aloza|first1=General Carlos|title=El Delf\u00edn de Fidel: La historia oculta tras el golpe del 4F|date=2014|isbn=1505750334|page=185|quote=On February 5, 1989, the transmission of Lusinchi's command to P\u00e9rez was effected with a lavish ceremony unprecedented in a democracy.

It opened for its first winter in 1980. There was so much snow in the first winter that the mountain was only able to open for 3 weeks, around many days of clearing the resort road with a bulldozer. John Lee was not a skier, so built Cardrona's base area in the middle of the resort at 1670m \u2013 something very rare for a ski field.\n\nThe resort was bought by the Vealls of Melbourne in 1989. This was also the year Cardrona built New Zealand's first international halfpipe.\n\nThe old Captain's chairlift (replaced by the Captain's Express) was reinstalled, as the Valley View Quad, below the existing Whitestar Express before the 2010 winter.   The main purpose of this lift was to allow construction of a competition grade downhill run, by increasing the lifted vertical available to the resort.  General trails are available though.  Due to insufficient snow cover this lift did not open for the 2010 season.  Stage 2 of the plan was set for the 2011 winter and added snowmaking.  The lift has opened every winter from 2011 onwards.\n\nIn 2013, New Zealand company Real Journeys purchased Cardrona Alpine Resort.\n\n[[File:Captains Basin view at Cadrona Skifield.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|Captains Basin view looking toward chairlift]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Cardrona Alpine Resort}}\n* [http://www.cardrona.com/ Cardrona Alpine Resort website]\n* [http://www.onthesnow.com/NZ-NZ/780/skireport.html OnTheSnow.com snow report for Cardrona]\n* [http://www.powderhounds.com/NewZealand/Cardrona.aspx Powderhounds.com reviews of Cardrona]\n* [http://www.newzealandski.co.nz/new-zealand/cardrona-ski-area/ New Zealand ski Cardrona page]\n\n{{Ski areas and resorts in New Zealand}}\n{{Otago skifields}}\n{{coord|-44.873937|168.949986|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Ski areas and resorts in Otago]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox ski area\n|name= Cardrona Alpine Resort\n|logo= \n|picture=Cardrona01 gobeirne.jpg \n|caption=\n|location= Otago [[South Island]], New Zealand\n|nearest_city= [[Wanaka, New Zealand]]\n|vertical= 600 m\n|top_elevation= 1894 m\n|base_elevation= 1670 m\n|skiable_area= 345 hectares\n|number_trails=\n|longest_run=\n|liftsystem= 6 total; 4 [[chairlifts]] (two fixed quads, one detachable quad, one detachable chondola), 2 magic learner, 1 platter\n|lift_capacity= 10200/hour\n|terrainparks= 7 (2 Half Pipes, 4 parks and 1 gravity cross course)\n|snowfall= 2.7 m (8.9 ft)\n|snowmaking= Yes\n|nightskiing= No\n|external_link= http://www.cardrona.com\n|}}\n\n'''Cardrona Alpine Resort''' is an [[alpine resort]] in New Zealand's [[South Island]].
