They were a group of 77 people originally from [[Guangzhou|Canton]], who had come to [[Central America]] to work on the [[Panama]] Railroad. During 1859-1863 under the administration of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Montealegre]], laws were enacted that prohibited the immigration of blacks and Asians, in an effort to preserve [[Costa Rica]] for [[European diaspora|European settlement]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lor\u00eda Chaves|Rodr\u00edguez Chaves|2001}}</ref> Later, \"a Chinese colony\" began to form in that area, founded by Joseph Chen Apuy, an immigrant from [[Zhongshan]], [[Guangdong]], who arrived in 1873.

In February 1887, the US railroad entrepreneur, [[Minor Cooper Keith]], had four hundred men working on a new line, but needed more labor. In October of the same year, following unsuccessful attempts to persuade commissioners in [[Italy]], the [[Canary Islands]] and Cape Verde, Keith traveled to [[London]] to arrange the import of [[Italians|Italian]] workers. On May 10, 1888, the Anna Elise docked in [[Lim\u00f3n, Costa Rica|Lim\u00f3n]] ([[Costa Rica]]). It was carrying 671 workers. These Italians joined other immigrants from China and elsewhere building the first railway line in Costa Rica. The conditions were dangerous, and the [[Italians]] were angered by the deaths of many workers. In October 1888, the Italian workers called a strike, and on 20 October 1888, large numbers deserted the work camps and fled to [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] ([[Costa Rica]]), where many settled, but others returned on a ship to Italy. They were replaced by 848 immigrants who came on March 16, 1889.<ref>''Revista Acta Acad\u00e9mica'' [http://www.prolades.com/cra/regions/cam/cri/italiana-4.htm La inmigraci\u00f3n italiana en Costa Rica] Retrieved, 2014/11/12.</ref> Currently, according to the census of 2012, there are 2,300 [[Italians]] in [[Costa Rica]], and their descendants are found in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]].\n\n=== Russian and ex-Soviet peoples ===\n[[Russians|Russian]] and Soviet immigration to [[Costa Rica]] occurred during the twentieth century. The arrivals hail in greatest numbers from [[Volga]], [[Belarus]] (including people from [[Ukraine]] and the [[Baltic countries]]), coming as refugees after the [[First World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. A number of Costa Ricans studied in the Soviet Union through scholarships, and came back married to Russians, establishing families in Costa Rica. According to the census of 2012, there are over 2,300 Russians in Costa Rica.\n\n=== Germans ===\nThe immigration of [[Germans]] to [[Costa Rica]] occurred in three main phases: prior to 1871 (the year in which the [[German Empire]] was founded), from 1871 to 1918, at the end of the [[First World War]], and from 1918-1919 until the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. The first [[Germans|German]] immigrants arrived between 1825 and 1826. In 1850, the [[German diaspora|German immigration]] was insignificant. In 1864 there were 164 Germans living in Costa Rica. Most were attracted by the growing foreign commerce. Others migrated because of the economic situation facing [[Germany]] in the 1840s and the failed revolution in 1848. Then came another group in the late nineteenth century. There were new infrastructure projects, and existing personal networks between [[Germany]] and [[Costa Rica]] helped to increase immigration. Before the [[First World War]], there was already a German Club, founded in 1910, and the German School which started in 1912. At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], a third group of immigrants arrived. After the war, relations were broken between two countries, and many naturalized [[Germans]] after the war no longer appear in the statistics.<ref>''Business Magazine'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20140321182915/http://business.highbeam.com/1033/article-1G1-183042711/la-inmigraci-n-alemana-en-costa-rica-migraci-n-crisis La inmigraci\u00f3n alemana en Costa Rica.

In 1929, about fifteen Poles arrived in Costa Rica, with the number rising to 90 in 1930. Among the first Polish arrivals were Jewish immigrants Jacobo Schifter and Lollew Gudmundson, who left their country to settle in [[Costa Rica]] This became a motivator for many more Poles to go Costa Rica. The largest wave of immigration of [[Poles]] to [[Costa Rica]] was between 1933 and 1936. Xenophobia developed in Costa Rica, because most of the [[Poles]] were of [[Jewish]] origin. The [[Poles]] in [[Costa Rica]] were engaged in the home industry and small businesses. Later, around 1939, several waves of [[Jewish]] [[Polish people|Polish]] families fleeing the [[Nazi]] repression arrived. Others followed after the war.

According to the census of 2012, there were 3,600 Argentines living in Costa Rica. Historically there were two migratory waves of refugees escaping from [[military dictatorships]] who ruled [[Argentina]] between 1976 and 1983. A second wave occurred during Argentina's economic crisis (1999-2002), when many [[Argentine]] professionals decided to migrate to [[Costa Rica]].

In February 1887, the US railroad entrepreneur, [[Minor Cooper Keith]], had four hundred men working on a new line, but needed more labor. In October of the same year, following unsuccessful attempts to persuade commissioners in [[Italy]], the [[Canary Islands]] and Cape Verde, Keith traveled to [[London]] to arrange the import of [[Italians|Italian]] workers. On May 10, 1888, the Anna Elise docked in [[Lim\u00f3n, Costa Rica|Lim\u00f3n]] ([[Costa Rica]]). It was carrying 671 workers. These Italians joined other immigrants from China and elsewhere building the first railway line in Costa Rica. The conditions were dangerous, and the [[Italians]] were angered by the deaths of many workers. In October 1888, the Italian workers called a strike, and on 20 October 1888, large numbers deserted the work camps and fled to [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] ([[Costa Rica]]), where many settled, but others returned on a ship to Italy.

The arrivals hail in greatest numbers from [[Volga]], [[Belarus]] (including people from [[Ukraine]] and the [[Baltic countries]]), coming as refugees after the [[First World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. A number of Costa Ricans studied in the Soviet Union through scholarships, and came back married to Russians, establishing families in Costa Rica. According to the census of 2012, there are over 2,300 Russians in Costa Rica.\n\n=== Germans ===\nThe immigration of [[Germans]] to [[Costa Rica]] occurred in three main phases: prior to 1871 (the year in which the [[German Empire]] was founded), from 1871 to 1918, at the end of the [[First World War]], and from 1918-1919 until the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. The first [[Germans|German]] immigrants arrived between 1825 and 1826. In 1850, the [[German diaspora|German immigration]] was insignificant. In 1864 there were 164 Germans living in Costa Rica. Most were attracted by the growing foreign commerce. Others migrated because of the economic situation facing [[Germany]] in the 1840s and the failed revolution in 1848. Then came another group in the late nineteenth century. There were new infrastructure projects, and existing personal networks between [[Germany]] and [[Costa Rica]] helped to increase immigration. Before the [[First World War]], there was already a German Club, founded in 1910, and the German School which started in 1912. At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], a third group of immigrants arrived. After the war, relations were broken between two countries, and many naturalized [[Germans]] after the war no longer appear in the statistics.<ref>''Business Magazine'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20140321182915/http://business.highbeam.com/1033/article-1G1-183042711/la-inmigraci-n-alemana-en-costa-rica-migraci-n-crisis La inmigraci\u00f3n alemana en Costa Rica.

Among the first Polish arrivals were Jewish immigrants Jacobo Schifter and Lollew Gudmundson, who left their country to settle in [[Costa Rica]] This became a motivator for many more Poles to go Costa Rica. The largest wave of immigration of [[Poles]] to [[Costa Rica]] was between 1933 and 1936. Xenophobia developed in Costa Rica, because most of the [[Poles]] were of [[Jewish]] origin. The [[Poles]] in [[Costa Rica]] were engaged in the home industry and small businesses. Later, around 1939, several waves of [[Jewish]] [[Polish people|Polish]] families fleeing the [[Nazi]] repression arrived. Others followed after the war.

A second wave occurred during Argentina's economic crisis (1999-2002), when many [[Argentine]] professionals decided to migrate to [[Costa Rica]]. The largest numbers of  Argentines in Costa Rica come from [[Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Rosario]]. Most of them reside in the provinces of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]], [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]], [[Lim\u00f3n Province|Lim\u00f3n]] and [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]].\n\n=== French ===\n[[French diaspora|French immigration]] in [[Costa Rica]] began in the 1840s. Following the victory of liberal governments, it became easier for painters, musicians and French singers to immigrate. France has contributed greatly to [[Costa Rican]] culture and influence. French composer Gabriel-Pierre Lafond was in part responsible for the national anthem of Costa Rica, the primary composer of which was Manuel Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez. The Museum of Art was created by French sculptor Louis-Robert Carrier Belleuse, and the [[flag of Costa Rica]] was inspired by the [[flag of France]].<ref>''Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Rep\u00fablica de Costa Rica'' [http://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=relaciones%20bilaterales&cat=relaciones%20bilaterales%20por%20pais&cont=522&codpais=FR Relaci\u00f3n de Costa Rica con Francia] Retrieved, 2014/11/12.</ref> Costa Rica is home to about 1,000 French people, according to the census of 2012.\n\n=== Ecuadorians ===\nAccording to the census of 2012, there are about 900 [[Demographics of Ecuador|Ecuadorians]] in [[Costa Rica]].

It is written in the preface to many editions that the book is sometimes 'erroneously' referred to as a trilogy, and goes on to state that it is one book in three volumes. Some people consider it to instead be a trilogy or series of three books, because it was originally published as a series of three volumes: ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', and ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

Immigrants would contract to work for an employer for a certain time period, usually between one and seven years, in exchange for the employer paying for their passage to the Americas. The employers provided subsistence for their indentured servants, but no wages. They could restrict some of the servants activities such as marriage, could sell or transfer the contracts to other employers, and could seek legal sanctions, such as prison, if the servants ran away. At the end of the agreed time period, the servant would be free to go their own way or demand wages for their work. In some cases, the newly freed servants also received items of value such as parcels of land or new clothes.<ref name=\"White Servitude\" />\n\nThe consensus view among economic historians and economists is that [[indentured servitude]] became popular in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in the seventeenth century because of a large demand for labor there, coupled with labor surpluses in Europe and high costs of transatlantic transportation beyond the means of European workers.<ref name=\"Galenson 1984: 3\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=140, 144|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

During the indenture period the servants were not paid cash wages, but were provided with food, accommodation, clothing and training. The indenture document specified how many years the servant would be required to work, after which they would be free. Terms of indenture ranged from one to seven years with typical terms of four or five years.<ref name=\"White Servitude\">[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009091039/http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2014-10-09 }}, by Richard Hofstadter</ref> In southern New England, a variant form of indentured servitude, which controlled the labor of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] through an exploitative [[Debt bondage|debt-peonage]] system, developed in the late 17th century and continued through to the period of the American Revolution.\n\nNot all European servants came willingly. Several instances of [[kidnapping]] for transportation to the Americas are recorded, though these were often indentured in the same way as their willing counterparts. An illustrative example is that of [[Peter Williamson (Indian Peter)|Peter Williamson]] (1730\u20131799). As historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] pointed out, \"Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the white colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents].\"<ref name=Hofstadter1750 />\n\nMany white immigrants arrived in colonial America as indentured servants, usually as young men and women from Britain or Germany, under the age of 21. Typically, the father of a teenager would sign the legal papers, and work out an arrangement with a ship captain, who would not charge the father any money.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">William Moraley and Susan E.

The latter were American-born children, usually orphans or from an impoverished family who could not care for them. They were under the control of courts and were bound out to work as an apprentice until a certain age. Two famous bound apprentices were [[Benjamin Franklin]] who illegally fled his apprenticeship to his brother, and [[Andrew Johnson]], who later became [[President of the United States]].<ref>Ruth Wallis Herndon and John E.

Evidence shows this practice was in use by 1609, only two years after the founding of the Virginia Company's original [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown settlement]].<ref name=\"Galenson 1984: 4\">Galenson 1984: 4</ref> However, this practice created a [[financial risk]] for the Virginia Company. If workers died or refused to work, the investment would be lost.<ref name=\"Galenson 1984: 4\"/>\n\nBy 1620, the Virginia Company switched to selling contracts of \"one hundred servants to be disposed among the old Planters\" as soon as the servants reached the colonies.<ref>Galenson 1984: 6</ref> This minimized risk on its investment to the 2\u20133 months of transatlantic voyage. As the system gained in popularity, individual farmers and tradesmen would eventually begin investing in indentured servants as well.<ref>Galenson 1984: 8</ref>\n\nThe archaeological excavation of a 17th-century Maryland residence in Anne Arundel County discovered what was most likely an indentured servant who was murdered buried and hidden beneath the floor alongside a garbage pit.<ref>National Museum of Natural History.

Tall, strong, healthy, literate or skilled servants would often serve shorter terms than less productive or more sickly servants.<ref>Grubb 1985: 868</ref><ref>Galenson June 1981: 462</ref> Similarly, destinations with harsh working climates such as the West Indies would come to offer shorter contracts compared to the more hospitable colonies.<ref name=\"Galenson March 1981: 40\"/>\n\nThe majority of indentured servants ended up in the American South, where cash crops necessitated labor-intensive farming. As the Northern colonies moved toward industrialization, they received far less indentured immigration.<ref>Grubb July 1985: 328</ref> For example, 96% of English emigrants to [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] from 1773 to 1776 were indentured servants. During the same time period, 2% of English emigrants to [[New England]] were indentured.<ref>Grubb July 1985: 334</ref>\n\n===Legal documents===\n[[File:Indenture - Servitude 1823.jpg|thumb|Indenture of apprenticeship binding Evan Morgan, a child aged 6 years and 11 months, for a period of 14 years, 1 month. Dated Feb. 1, 1823, Sussex Co., Delaware.]]\nAn indenture was a legal contract enforced by the courts. One indenture reads as follows:<ref>Frank R. Diffenderffer, ''The German Immigration into Pennsylvania Through the Port of Philadelphia, 1700\u20131775'', Genealogical Pub. Co., Baltimore, 1979.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThis INDENTURE Witnesseth that James Best a Labourer doth Voluntarily put himself Servant to Captain\nStephen Jones Master of the Snow Sally to serve the said Stephen Jones and his Assigns, for and during the full Space, Time and Term of three Years from the first Day of the said James\u2019 arrival in Philadelphia in AMERICA, during which Time or Term the said Master or his Assigns shall and will find and supply the said James with sufficient Meat, Drink, Apparel, Lodging and all other necessaries befitting such a Servant, and at the end and expiration of said Term, the said James to be made Free, and receive according to the Custom of the Country.

(signatures)\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen the ship arrived, the captain would often advertise in a newspaper that indentured servants were for sale:<ref>''Pennsylvania Gazette'' (weekly Philadelphia newspaper), August 17, 1774</ref>\n<blockquote>\nJust imported, on board the Snow Sally, Captain Stephen Jones, Master, from England, A number of healthy, stout English and Welsh Servants and Redemptioners, and a few Palatines [Germans], amongst whom are the following tradesmen, viz.

The ''Philadelphia Mayor\u2019s Court Indenture Book'', page 742, for September 18, 1773 has the following entry:<ref>''Record of Indentures, Philadelphia, 1771\u20131773'', Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, 1973.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nJames Best,\nwho was under Indenture of Redemption to Captain\nStephen Jones now cancelled in consideration of \u00a3 15,\npaid for his Passage from London bound a servant\nto David Rittenhouse of the City of Philadelphia\n& assigns three years to be found all necessaries.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Restrictions===\n\nIndentures could not marry without the permission of their owner, were subject to physical punishment (like many young ordinary servants), and saw their obligation to labor enforced by the courts. To ensure uninterrupted work by the female servants, the law lengthened the term of their indenture if they became pregnant. But unlike slaves, servants were guaranteed to be eventually released from bondage. At the end of their term they received a payment known as \"freedom dues\" and become free members of society.<ref>Eric Foner: Give me liberty. W.W. Norton & Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-393-97873-5}}.</ref> One could buy and sell indentured servants' contracts, and the right to their labor would change hands, but not the person as a piece of property.\n\nBoth male and female laborers could be subject to violence, occasionally even resulting in death. [[Richard Hofstadter]] notes that, as slaves arrived in greater numbers after 1700, white laborers in Virginia became a \"privileged stratum, assigned to lighter work and more skilled tasks\".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\"/> He also notes that \"Runaways were regularly advertised in the newspapers, rewards were offered, and both sheriffs and the general public were enlisted to secure their return. ... The standard penalty in the North, not always rigorously enforced, was extra service of twice the time the master had lost, though [[flagellation|whipping]] was also common.\"<ref name=\"Hofstadter\">[http://www.mc.cc.md.us/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043503/http://www.mc.cc.md.us/departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, by Richard Hofstadter</ref>\n\n===Redemptioner profile===\n\nIndentured servitude was a method of increasing the number of colonists, especially in the [[English colonial empire|English]] and later British colonies. Voluntary migration and [[convict]] labor only provided so many people, and since the journey across the Atlantic was dangerous, other means of encouraging settlement were necessary. Contract-laborers became an important group of people and so numerous that the [[United States Constitution]] counted them specifically in appointing representatives:\n{{quote|Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, ''including those bound to Service for a Term of Years''....<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 2.</ref>}}\n\nDisplaced from their land and unable to find work in the cities, many of these people signed contracts of indenture and took passage to the Americas. In Massachusetts, religious instruction in the [[Puritan]] way of life was often part of the condition of indenture, and people tended to live in towns.\n\nThe labor-intensive cash crop of [[tobacco]] was farmed in the [[American South]] by indentured laborers in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"VJT\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Laws on Indentured Servants\n | publisher = VirtualJamestown.org\n | date = {{circa|1619\u20131654}}\n | url = http://www.virtualjamestown.org/servlaws.html\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2008-08-18}}</ref> Indentured servitude was not the same as the [[apprenticeship]] system by which skilled trades were taught, but similarities do exist between the two, since both require a set period of work. The majority of Virginians were Anglican, not Puritan, and while religion did play a large role in everyday lives, the culture was more commercially based. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina, tobacco constituted a major percentage of the total agricultural output. (In the Deep South (mainly Georgia and South Carolina), cotton and rice plantations dominated.) In the lower Atlantic colonies [[Tobacco in the American Colonies|where tobacco was the main cash crop]], the majority of labor that indentured servants performed was related to field work. In this situation, social isolation could increase the possibilities for both direct and indirect abuse, as could lengthy, demanding labor in the tobacco fields.\n\nThe system was still widely practiced in the 1780s, picking up immediately after a hiatus during the American Revolution. [[Fernand Braudel]] (''The Perspective of the World'' 1984, pp.&nbsp;405ff) instances a 1783 report on \"the import trade from Ireland\" and its large profits to a ship owner or a captain, who:\n{{quote|...puts his conditions to the emigrants in [[Dublin]] or some other Irish port. Those who can pay for their passage\u2014usually about 100 or 80 {{bracket|[[livre tournois|livres tournois]]}}\u2014arrive in America free to take any engagement that suits them. Those who cannot pay are carried at the expense of the shipowner, who in order to recoup his money, advertises on arrival that he has imported artisans, laborers and domestic servants and that he has agreed with them on his own account to hire their services for a period normally of three, four, or five years for men and women and 6 or 7 years for children.}}\n\nIn modern terms, the shipowner was acting as a [[independent contractor|contractor]], hiring out his laborers. Such circumstances affected the treatment a captain gave his valuable human cargo. After indentures were forbidden, the passage had to be prepaid, giving rise to the inhumane conditions of Irish '[[coffin ship]]s' in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>Jackson, Pauline (1984). \"Women in 19th Century Irish Emigration\"</ref>\n\n===Southern New England Native Americans and indenture===\n{{Slavery}}\nStarting in the late 17th century, in southern New England and parts of Long Island, Native Americans were increasingly pulled into an exploitative debt-peonage system designed to control and assimilate Native American people into the dominant culture as well as channel their labor into the market-based Atlantic economy.<ref>The literature on New England Native American indenture, while relatively new is actually vast and growing.

Due to restricted access to resources, [[land consumption|land loss]], and changes to the environment caused by European settlement, many Native Americans, especially coastal groups, could no longer practice traditional subsistence activities and therefore became increasingly dependent on European trade goods\u2014cloth, tools, guns, alcohol, and increasingly, food. Merchants trading these items to Native Americans often inflated the cost and, based on a predatory lending scheme, advanced them credit for these purchases, knowing full well most Native Americans would not be able to repay the debts. Eventually when debts mounted, Native Americans were hauled into court by their creditors. When they could not pay either their lands, or more commonly their labor, was seized to settle the debt. Native American debtors were then indentured to their creditors for terms ranging from a few months to sometimes years. Rare cases exist when Native Americans were indentured for a decade or more and a few were enslaved for life (this was quite rare however).<ref name=nativeamindentures>Perhaps the largest source of information about these indentures are dozens of debt proceedings against Native Americans in David T. Konig, ed.

The 'time' Native American servants owed could be sold or willed to heirs if a creditor died.\n\nAssessing how many Native Americans experienced indenture is difficult as exact Native American populations during the colonial period are unknown. However, Historian John Sainsbury was able to document that by the mid-18th century about a third of all Native Americans in Rhode Island were indentured servants living and working in white households. Also, the Massachusetts state archives contains numerous petitions, written from the 1730s to 1760s from Native American tribes in their jurisdiction complaining about abuses in the indenture system and predatory lending by whites. Statutes were eventually passed attempting to regulate practices. Colonial military records do provide some data on Native American indenture as well. Enlistment records from 1704 to 1726 show that almost two-thirds of Native Americans who joined the army were indentured at the time of their enlistment. Records from 1748 to 1760 show a decline in this rate, but still show almost a third of Native American recruits being bound to white masters at the time of their enlistment. One Connecticut regiment raised in 1746 during [[King George's War]] (containing 980 men total) contained 139 Native American men. Almost half of them had signed their wages over to white creditors before being deployed.<ref>Sainsbury, \"Indian Labor in Early Rhode Island\"; Brian D.

These [[whaling indentures]] were somewhat distinct from normal indenture contracts, and stipulated that Native Americans serve not as servants in white households but instead as crew members on a certain number of whaling voyages or 'seasons' of whaling (typically November through April).  Throughout most of the colonial period indentured or heavily indebted Native American whalers were the primary labor force in the early whaling industry. They remained an important source of labor into the Revolutionary and early national era, but as their numbers dwindled and the industry expanded exponentially, they made up a decreasingly small proportion of the labor force.<ref>Daniel Vickers, \"The First Whalemen of Nantucket,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd ser. 40 (1983): 560\u201383, and \"Nantucket Whalemen in the Deep-Sea Fishery: The Changing Anatomy of an Early American Labor Force,\" ''Journal of American History'' 72 (1985): 277\u201396; Elizabeth A.

Increased lobbying from [[Emigrant Aid Societies|immigrant aid societies]] led to increased regulation of the indentured labor market, further increasing the difficulty of enforcing contracts. With less ability to enforce the contracts, demand for indentured servants may have fallen. However, most debtor prisons were still in service when indentured servitude disappeared and many regulations on indentured servitude were put in place well before the practice's disappearance.<ref>Grubb Spring 1994: 6</ref>\n\nA rise in European [[Per capita income|per-capita income]] compared to passage fare during the nineteenth century may also explain the disappearance of indentured servitude. While passage from England to the colonies in 1668 would cost roughly 51 percent of English per-capita income, that ratio would decrease to between 20 and 30 percent by 1841.<ref>Galenson 1984: 18</ref> This increase in relative income may have been further supplemented by a demonstrated increase in savings among European laborers, meaning European emigrants would have the capital on hand to pay for their own passage. With no need for transit capital, fewer laborers would have become indentured, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of indentured servants would have decreased.<ref>Grubb Dec. 1994: 815</ref><ref>Galenson 1984: 22</ref>\n\nLabor substitutions may have led employers away from indentured servants and towards slaves or paid employees. In many places, [[Slavery in the United States#Colonial America|African slaves]] became cheaper for unskilled and then eventually skilled labor, and most farmhand positions previously filled by indentured servants were ultimately filled by slaves.<ref>Galenson March 1981: 47</ref> [[Wage labor]]ers may have been more productive, since employers were more willing to terminate waged employment. In comparison, firing an indentured servant would mean a loss on the original capital investment spent purchasing the servant's contract.<ref>Grubb Spring 1994: 21</ref> Either substitution would lead to a decrease in demand for indentured servitude. An additional problem for employers was that, compared to African slaves, European indentured servants who ran away could not always be easily distinguished from the general white population, so they were more difficult to re-capture.\n\nIndentured servitude's decline for white servants was also largely a result of changing attitudes that accrued over the 18th century and culminated in the early 19th century. Over the 18th century, the penal sanctions that were used against all workers were slowly going away from colonial codes, leaving indentured servants the only adult white labor subject to penal sanctions (with the notable exception of seaman, whose contracts could be criminally enforced up to the 20th century). These penal sanctions for indentured laborers continued in the United States until the 1830s, and by this point treatment of European laborers under contract became the same as the treatment of wage laborers (however, this change in treatment didn't apply to workers of color). This change in treatment can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the growing identification of white indented labor with slavery at a time when slavery was coming under attack in the Northern states, the growing radicalism of workers influenced with the rhetoric of the American Revolution, and the expansion of suffrage in many states which empowered workers politically. Penal sanctions, previously considered perfectly in line with free labor, became in the 19th century a way to transform ordinary labor into \"contracts of slavery.\"<ref name=Steinfeld>{{cite book|last=Steinfeld|first=Robert J.|title=Coercion, contract, and free labor in the nineteenth century|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge |isbn=0521774004}}</ref>\n\n====Labor market dynamics====\nGiven the rapid expansion of colonial export industries in the 17th and 18th century, natural population growth and immigration were unable to meet the increasing demand for workers. As a result, the cost of indentured servants rose substantially.  In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, the cost of indentures rose as much as 60% in the 1680s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Menard|first=Russel|title=From Servant to Freeholder: Status Mobility and Property Accumulation in Seventeenth-Century Maryland|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|year=1973|volume=30|series=1|pages=37\u201364 [50]|doi=10.2307/1923702|jstor=1923702}}</ref>  The increase in the price of indentures did not however act as an incentive for European workers to emigrate for they were not affected by the price at which they were sold in American ports. As a result, the companies that generated indentures disrupted the price signaling effect and thus the supply of immigrants did not expand sufficiently to meet demand. Some actors in the market attempted to generate incentives for workers by shortening the length of indenture contracts based on the productivity of the prospective emigrant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [10]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref>  Some American firms also opted to incentivize workers by paying small wages or by negotiating early expiration of indentures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=8\u20139|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref> \nThe rising cost of indentured labor and its inelastic supply pushed American producers towards other forms of labor. Slaves were substantially cheaper and the supply of them was more abundant for it was not constrained by the slaves\u2019 willingness to emigrate. Additionally, slave traders were directly incentivized by the price mechanism to expand \"production\" (in the form of raiding expeditions), so supply was relatively elastic. Slavery thus was better able to satisfy labor demands in colonies requiring large quantities of unskilled workers (for example plantation colonies in the Caribbean).  Indentures however prevailed in colonies that required skilled workers (in which the cost of training a slave was higher than the price differential between a slave and an indentured servant). Alison Smith and Abbott E Smith's analysis of London port records shows how destination of indentured emigrants shifted from the West Indies towards New England as early as the 1660s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Abbott Emerson|first=Smith|title=Colonists in Bondage: White Servitude and Convict Labor in America, 1607\u20131776|year=1947|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}</ref> supporting the theory that indentured servitude might have declined in some regions because of labor market dynamics.\n\n====Affordability of immigration====\nThe rise in the affordability of immigration reduced emigrants\u2019 need for external financing in the form of indentures. David Galenson's analysis on affordability shows that the cost of immigration from Britain to the United States over the course of the 18th century dropped from 50% of per capita income to less than 10%.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}  This is attributable to higher levels of real income in Europe (a result of economic growth in the 18th century) and to a sharp decline in transportation costs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [18]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref>\nInnovation had a strong impact on the ease and cost of passenger transportation, reducing the need of indentures. The railroad made non-port cities a much cheaper destination for immigrants. The steamboat was not necessarily cheaper than older sailing technologies, but it made transatlantic travel much easier and comfortable, an attractive factor for high-income classes (that could easily afford immigration without indentures).<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Philip|title=The Distant Magnet: European Immigration to the U.S.A|year=1971|publisher=Ayre & Spottiswoode|location=London}}</ref> \nThe British Navy's efforts against piracy also reduced transportation costs. Safer seas implied smaller crews (for there was no need to man weapons on board) and also reduced insurance costs (ships were at lower risk of being captured).\nThe composition of immigrants also shifted from single males towards entire families. Single males usually left their homes with little if any savings. Instead, families generally liquidated assets in Europe to finance their venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [21]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Salinger|first=Sharon V.|title=Colonial Labor in Transition: The Decline of Indentured Servitude in Late Eighteenth\u2010Century Philadelphia|journal=Labor History|year=1981|volume=22|issue=2|series=2|pages=165\u201391 [169]|doi=10.1080/00236568108584612}}</ref>\n\n====Impact of American Revolution====\nThe American Revolution severely limited immigration to the United States.

Existing slaves became indentured servants. That status was finally ended in 1827 and all the indentured obtained full freedom.<ref>See [https://web.archive.org/web/20101109220448/http://www.archives.nysed.gov/education/showcase/201011afamvoting/index.shtml \"African American Voting Rights (go down the page)]</ref>\n\nA number of acts passed by both the American and the British governments fostered the decline of indentures. The English Passenger Vessels Act of 1803, which regulated travel conditions aboard ships, attempted to make transportation more expensive in order to stop emigration. The American abolition of imprisonment of debtors by federal law (passed in 1833) made prosecution of runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/02/24/debtors-prisons-then-and-now-faq|title=Debtors' Prisons, Then and Now: FAQ|last=Congress|first=Library of|date=2015-02-24|website=The Marshall Project|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Richard B.|title=Labor Controls in Maryland in the Nineteenth Century|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume= 14| issue = 3|pages=385\u2013400|jstor=2197881|year=1948|doi=10.2307/2197881}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, most indentures of this nature occurred in the old [[Northwest Territory]]. The permissibility of such indentures centered on the interpretation of \"involuntary servitude\" per the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]], which declared:\n\n{{quote|There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the Party shall have been duly convicted.<ref name=Steinfeld />}}\n\nThe permissibility (or not) of penal sanctions in labor became an issue of \"fundamental law\", in which it was questioned whether those sanctions or specific performance enforcements turned indentured servitude into \"involuntary servitude\". At the time when the Northwest Ordinance was constructed, white adult servants were still being imported into the United States, and thus, historically, it seems likely that the Ordinance's framers considered indenture to be a form of \"voluntary\" servitude. In essence, this means the indentured servant chose to work for someone who bought them something.<ref name=Steinfeld />\n\nThe [[Territory of Hawaii]] was the last place in the United States to widely use indentures, as by 1900 the practice had been abolished in the rest of the country and replaced by alternatives such as the [[credit-ticket system]] used to transport Chinese laborers.<ref>Cloud, Patricia and David W.

However, forceful indenture also provided part of the servants: contemporaries report that youngsters were sometimes tricked into servitude in order to be exploited in the colonies.<ref>Alexandre Olivier Ecquemelin, ''The History of Buccaneers in America'' (1853 edition), p. 46</ref>\n\nThe landowners on the islands would pay for a servant's passage and then provide the servant with food, clothes, shelter and instruction during the agreed term. The servant would then be required to work in the landowner's field for a term of bondage (usually four to seven years). During this term of bondage the servant had a status similar to a son of the master. For example, the servant was not allowed to marry without the master's permission. Servants could own personal property. They could also complain to a local magistrate about mistreatment that exceeded community norms. However, a servant's contract could be sold or given away by his master.\n\nAfter the servant's term was complete he became independent and was paid \"freedom dues\". These payments could take the form of land which would give the servant the opportunity to become an independent farmer or a free laborer.  As free men with little money they became a political force that stood in opposition to the rich planters.<ref>Lewis and Maingot (2004)  p. 97</ref>\n\nIndentured servitude was a common part of the social landscape in England and Ireland during the 17th century. During the 17th century, British and Irish went to [[Barbados]] as both masters and as indentured servants.

Newly freed servant farmers, given 25\u201350 acres of land, were unable to make a living because profitable [[sugar cane|sugar]] plantations needed to cover hundreds of acres.  However, profit could still be made through the tobacco trade, which was what these small 25-acre farms did to live comfortably. The landowners\u2019 reputation as cruel masters became a deterrent to the potential indentured servant. In the 17th century, the islands became known as death traps, as between 33 and 50 percent of indentured servants died before they were freed, many from [[yellow fever]], [[malaria]] and other diseases.<ref name=burnard>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3788343?uid=3738776&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101834820177 A failed settler society: marriage and demographic failure in early Jamaica], ''[[Journal of Social History]]'',  Vol. 28, No. 1, Autumn, 1994, by Trevor Burnard</ref>\n\nWhen [[British Empire#Abolition of slavery|slavery ended in the British Empire]] in 1833, plantation owners turned to [[indentured servitude]] for inexpensive labor.

Several instances of [[kidnapping]] for transportation to the Americas are recorded, though these were often indentured in the same way as their willing counterparts. An illustrative example is that of [[Peter Williamson (Indian Peter)|Peter Williamson]] (1730\u20131799). As historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] pointed out, \"Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the white colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents].\"<ref name=Hofstadter1750 />\n\nMany white immigrants arrived in colonial America as indentured servants, usually as young men and women from Britain or Germany, under the age of 21.

The latter were American-born children, usually orphans or from an impoverished family who could not care for them. They were under the control of courts and were bound out to work as an apprentice until a certain age. Two famous bound apprentices were [[Benjamin Franklin]] who illegally fled his apprenticeship to his brother, and [[Andrew Johnson]], who later became [[President of the United States]].<ref>Ruth Wallis Herndon and John E.

Evidence shows this practice was in use by 1609, only two years after the founding of the Virginia Company's original [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown settlement]].<ref name=\"Galenson 1984: 4\">Galenson 1984: 4</ref> However, this practice created a [[financial risk]] for the Virginia Company. If workers died or refused to work, the investment would be lost.<ref name=\"Galenson 1984: 4\"/>\n\nBy 1620, the Virginia Company switched to selling contracts of \"one hundred servants to be disposed among the old Planters\" as soon as the servants reached the colonies.<ref>Galenson 1984: 6</ref> This minimized risk on its investment to the 2\u20133 months of transatlantic voyage. As the system gained in popularity, individual farmers and tradesmen would eventually begin investing in indentured servants as well.<ref>Galenson 1984: 8</ref>\n\nThe archaeological excavation of a 17th-century Maryland residence in Anne Arundel County discovered what was most likely an indentured servant who was murdered buried and hidden beneath the floor alongside a garbage pit.<ref>National Museum of Natural History.

Tall, strong, healthy, literate or skilled servants would often serve shorter terms than less productive or more sickly servants.<ref>Grubb 1985: 868</ref><ref>Galenson June 1981: 462</ref> Similarly, destinations with harsh working climates such as the West Indies would come to offer shorter contracts compared to the more hospitable colonies.<ref name=\"Galenson March 1981: 40\"/>\n\nThe majority of indentured servants ended up in the American South, where cash crops necessitated labor-intensive farming. As the Northern colonies moved toward industrialization, they received far less indentured immigration.<ref>Grubb July 1985: 328</ref> For example, 96% of English emigrants to [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] from 1773 to 1776 were indentured servants.

Dated Feb. 1, 1823, Sussex Co., Delaware.]]\nAn indenture was a legal contract enforced by the courts. One indenture reads as follows:<ref>Frank R. Diffenderffer, ''The German Immigration into Pennsylvania Through the Port of Philadelphia, 1700\u20131775'', Genealogical Pub. Co., Baltimore, 1979.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThis INDENTURE Witnesseth that James Best a Labourer doth Voluntarily put himself Servant to Captain\nStephen Jones Master of the Snow Sally to serve the said Stephen Jones and his Assigns, for and during the full Space, Time and Term of three Years from the first Day of the said James\u2019 arrival in Philadelphia in AMERICA, during which Time or Term the said Master or his Assigns shall and will find and supply the said James with sufficient Meat, Drink, Apparel, Lodging and all other necessaries befitting such a Servant, and at the end and expiration of said Term, the said James to be made Free, and receive according to the Custom of the Country.

(signatures)\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen the ship arrived, the captain would often advertise in a newspaper that indentured servants were for sale:<ref>''Pennsylvania Gazette'' (weekly Philadelphia newspaper), August 17, 1774</ref>\n<blockquote>\nJust imported, on board the Snow Sally, Captain Stephen Jones, Master, from England, A number of healthy, stout English and Welsh Servants and Redemptioners, and a few Palatines [Germans], amongst whom are the following tradesmen, viz.

The ''Philadelphia Mayor\u2019s Court Indenture Book'', page 742, for September 18, 1773 has the following entry:<ref>''Record of Indentures, Philadelphia, 1771\u20131773'', Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, 1973.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nJames Best,\nwho was under Indenture of Redemption to Captain\nStephen Jones now cancelled in consideration of \u00a3 15,\npaid for his Passage from London bound a servant\nto David Rittenhouse of the City of Philadelphia\n& assigns three years to be found all necessaries.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Restrictions===\n\nIndentures could not marry without the permission of their owner, were subject to physical punishment (like many young ordinary servants), and saw their obligation to labor enforced by the courts. To ensure uninterrupted work by the female servants, the law lengthened the term of their indenture if they became pregnant. But unlike slaves, servants were guaranteed to be eventually released from bondage. At the end of their term they received a payment known as \"freedom dues\" and become free members of society.<ref>Eric Foner: Give me liberty. W.W. Norton & Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-393-97873-5}}.</ref> One could buy and sell indentured servants' contracts, and the right to their labor would change hands, but not the person as a piece of property.\n\nBoth male and female laborers could be subject to violence, occasionally even resulting in death. [[Richard Hofstadter]] notes that, as slaves arrived in greater numbers after 1700, white laborers in Virginia became a \"privileged stratum, assigned to lighter work and more skilled tasks\".<ref name=\"Hofstadter\"/> He also notes that \"Runaways were regularly advertised in the newspapers, rewards were offered, and both sheriffs and the general public were enlisted to secure their return. ... The standard penalty in the North, not always rigorously enforced, was extra service of twice the time the master had lost, though [[flagellation|whipping]] was also common.\"<ref name=\"Hofstadter\">[http://www.mc.cc.md.us/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043503/http://www.mc.cc.md.us/departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, by Richard Hofstadter</ref>\n\n===Redemptioner profile===\n\nIndentured servitude was a method of increasing the number of colonists, especially in the [[English colonial empire|English]] and later British colonies. Voluntary migration and [[convict]] labor only provided so many people, and since the journey across the Atlantic was dangerous, other means of encouraging settlement were necessary. Contract-laborers became an important group of people and so numerous that the [[United States Constitution]] counted them specifically in appointing representatives:\n{{quote|Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, ''including those bound to Service for a Term of Years''....<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 2.</ref>}}\n\nDisplaced from their land and unable to find work in the cities, many of these people signed contracts of indenture and took passage to the Americas. In Massachusetts, religious instruction in the [[Puritan]] way of life was often part of the condition of indenture, and people tended to live in towns.\n\nThe labor-intensive cash crop of [[tobacco]] was farmed in the [[American South]] by indentured laborers in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"VJT\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Laws on Indentured Servants\n | publisher = VirtualJamestown.org\n | date = {{circa|1619\u20131654}}\n | url = http://www.virtualjamestown.org/servlaws.html\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2008-08-18}}</ref> Indentured servitude was not the same as the [[apprenticeship]] system by which skilled trades were taught, but similarities do exist between the two, since both require a set period of work. The majority of Virginians were Anglican, not Puritan, and while religion did play a large role in everyday lives, the culture was more commercially based. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina, tobacco constituted a major percentage of the total agricultural output. (In the Deep South (mainly Georgia and South Carolina), cotton and rice plantations dominated.) In the lower Atlantic colonies [[Tobacco in the American Colonies|where tobacco was the main cash crop]], the majority of labor that indentured servants performed was related to field work. In this situation, social isolation could increase the possibilities for both direct and indirect abuse, as could lengthy, demanding labor in the tobacco fields.\n\nThe system was still widely practiced in the 1780s, picking up immediately after a hiatus during the American Revolution. [[Fernand Braudel]] (''The Perspective of the World'' 1984, pp.&nbsp;405ff) instances a 1783 report on \"the import trade from Ireland\" and its large profits to a ship owner or a captain, who:\n{{quote|...puts his conditions to the emigrants in [[Dublin]] or some other Irish port. Those who can pay for their passage\u2014usually about 100 or 80 {{bracket|[[livre tournois|livres tournois]]}}\u2014arrive in America free to take any engagement that suits them. Those who cannot pay are carried at the expense of the shipowner, who in order to recoup his money, advertises on arrival that he has imported artisans, laborers and domestic servants and that he has agreed with them on his own account to hire their services for a period normally of three, four, or five years for men and women and 6 or 7 years for children.}}\n\nIn modern terms, the shipowner was acting as a [[independent contractor|contractor]], hiring out his laborers. Such circumstances affected the treatment a captain gave his valuable human cargo. After indentures were forbidden, the passage had to be prepaid, giving rise to the inhumane conditions of Irish '[[coffin ship]]s' in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>Jackson, Pauline (1984). \"Women in 19th Century Irish Emigration\"</ref>\n\n===Southern New England Native Americans and indenture===\n{{Slavery}}\nStarting in the late 17th century, in southern New England and parts of Long Island, Native Americans were increasingly pulled into an exploitative debt-peonage system designed to control and assimilate Native American people into the dominant culture as well as channel their labor into the market-based Atlantic economy.<ref>The literature on New England Native American indenture, while relatively new is actually vast and growing.

Due to restricted access to resources, [[land consumption|land loss]], and changes to the environment caused by European settlement, many Native Americans, especially coastal groups, could no longer practice traditional subsistence activities and therefore became increasingly dependent on European trade goods\u2014cloth, tools, guns, alcohol, and increasingly, food. Merchants trading these items to Native Americans often inflated the cost and, based on a predatory lending scheme, advanced them credit for these purchases, knowing full well most Native Americans would not be able to repay the debts. Eventually when debts mounted, Native Americans were hauled into court by their creditors. When they could not pay either their lands, or more commonly their labor, was seized to settle the debt. Native American debtors were then indentured to their creditors for terms ranging from a few months to sometimes years. Rare cases exist when Native Americans were indentured for a decade or more and a few were enslaved for life (this was quite rare however).<ref name=nativeamindentures>Perhaps the largest source of information about these indentures are dozens of debt proceedings against Native Americans in David T.

The 'time' Native American servants owed could be sold or willed to heirs if a creditor died.\n\nAssessing how many Native Americans experienced indenture is difficult as exact Native American populations during the colonial period are unknown. However, Historian John Sainsbury was able to document that by the mid-18th century about a third of all Native Americans in Rhode Island were indentured servants living and working in white households. Also, the Massachusetts state archives contains numerous petitions, written from the 1730s to 1760s from Native American tribes in their jurisdiction complaining about abuses in the indenture system and predatory lending by whites. Statutes were eventually passed attempting to regulate practices. Colonial military records do provide some data on Native American indenture as well. Enlistment records from 1704 to 1726 show that almost two-thirds of Native Americans who joined the army were indentured at the time of their enlistment. Records from 1748 to 1760 show a decline in this rate, but still show almost a third of Native American recruits being bound to white masters at the time of their enlistment. One Connecticut regiment raised in 1746 during [[King George's War]] (containing 980 men total) contained 139 Native American men. Almost half of them had signed their wages over to white creditors before being deployed.<ref>Sainsbury, \"Indian Labor in Early Rhode Island\"; Brian D.

These [[whaling indentures]] were somewhat distinct from normal indenture contracts, and stipulated that Native Americans serve not as servants in white households but instead as crew members on a certain number of whaling voyages or 'seasons' of whaling (typically November through April).  Throughout most of the colonial period indentured or heavily indebted Native American whalers were the primary labor force in the early whaling industry. They remained an important source of labor into the Revolutionary and early national era, but as their numbers dwindled and the industry expanded exponentially, they made up a decreasingly small proportion of the labor force.<ref>Daniel Vickers, \"The First Whalemen of Nantucket,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd ser. 40 (1983): 560\u201383, and \"Nantucket Whalemen in the Deep-Sea Fishery: The Changing Anatomy of an Early American Labor Force,\" ''Journal of American History'' 72 (1985): 277\u201396; Elizabeth A.

Increased lobbying from [[Emigrant Aid Societies|immigrant aid societies]] led to increased regulation of the indentured labor market, further increasing the difficulty of enforcing contracts. With less ability to enforce the contracts, demand for indentured servants may have fallen. However, most debtor prisons were still in service when indentured servitude disappeared and many regulations on indentured servitude were put in place well before the practice's disappearance.<ref>Grubb Spring 1994: 6</ref>\n\nA rise in European [[Per capita income|per-capita income]] compared to passage fare during the nineteenth century may also explain the disappearance of indentured servitude. While passage from England to the colonies in 1668 would cost roughly 51 percent of English per-capita income, that ratio would decrease to between 20 and 30 percent by 1841.<ref>Galenson 1984: 18</ref> This increase in relative income may have been further supplemented by a demonstrated increase in savings among European laborers, meaning European emigrants would have the capital on hand to pay for their own passage. With no need for transit capital, fewer laborers would have become indentured, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of indentured servants would have decreased.<ref>Grubb Dec. 1994: 815</ref><ref>Galenson 1984: 22</ref>\n\nLabor substitutions may have led employers away from indentured servants and towards slaves or paid employees. In many places, [[Slavery in the United States#Colonial America|African slaves]] became cheaper for unskilled and then eventually skilled labor, and most farmhand positions previously filled by indentured servants were ultimately filled by slaves.<ref>Galenson March 1981: 47</ref> [[Wage labor]]ers may have been more productive, since employers were more willing to terminate waged employment. In comparison, firing an indentured servant would mean a loss on the original capital investment spent purchasing the servant's contract.<ref>Grubb Spring 1994: 21</ref> Either substitution would lead to a decrease in demand for indentured servitude. An additional problem for employers was that, compared to African slaves, European indentured servants who ran away could not always be easily distinguished from the general white population, so they were more difficult to re-capture.\n\nIndentured servitude's decline for white servants was also largely a result of changing attitudes that accrued over the 18th century and culminated in the early 19th century. Over the 18th century, the penal sanctions that were used against all workers were slowly going away from colonial codes, leaving indentured servants the only adult white labor subject to penal sanctions (with the notable exception of seaman, whose contracts could be criminally enforced up to the 20th century). These penal sanctions for indentured laborers continued in the United States until the 1830s, and by this point treatment of European laborers under contract became the same as the treatment of wage laborers (however, this change in treatment didn't apply to workers of color). This change in treatment can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the growing identification of white indented labor with slavery at a time when slavery was coming under attack in the Northern states, the growing radicalism of workers influenced with the rhetoric of the American Revolution, and the expansion of suffrage in many states which empowered workers politically. Penal sanctions, previously considered perfectly in line with free labor, became in the 19th century a way to transform ordinary labor into \"contracts of slavery.\"<ref name=Steinfeld>{{cite book|last=Steinfeld|first=Robert J.|title=Coercion, contract, and free labor in the nineteenth century|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge |isbn=0521774004}}</ref>\n\n====Labor market dynamics====\nGiven the rapid expansion of colonial export industries in the 17th and 18th century, natural population growth and immigration were unable to meet the increasing demand for workers. As a result, the cost of indentured servants rose substantially.  In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, the cost of indentures rose as much as 60% in the 1680s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Menard|first=Russel|title=From Servant to Freeholder: Status Mobility and Property Accumulation in Seventeenth-Century Maryland|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|year=1973|volume=30|series=1|pages=37\u201364 [50]|doi=10.2307/1923702|jstor=1923702}}</ref>  The increase in the price of indentures did not however act as an incentive for European workers to emigrate for they were not affected by the price at which they were sold in American ports. As a result, the companies that generated indentures disrupted the price signaling effect and thus the supply of immigrants did not expand sufficiently to meet demand. Some actors in the market attempted to generate incentives for workers by shortening the length of indenture contracts based on the productivity of the prospective emigrant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [10]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref>  Some American firms also opted to incentivize workers by paying small wages or by negotiating early expiration of indentures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=8\u20139|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref> \nThe rising cost of indentured labor and its inelastic supply pushed American producers towards other forms of labor. Slaves were substantially cheaper and the supply of them was more abundant for it was not constrained by the slaves\u2019 willingness to emigrate. Additionally, slave traders were directly incentivized by the price mechanism to expand \"production\" (in the form of raiding expeditions), so supply was relatively elastic. Slavery thus was better able to satisfy labor demands in colonies requiring large quantities of unskilled workers (for example plantation colonies in the Caribbean).  Indentures however prevailed in colonies that required skilled workers (in which the cost of training a slave was higher than the price differential between a slave and an indentured servant). Alison Smith and Abbott E Smith's analysis of London port records shows how destination of indentured emigrants shifted from the West Indies towards New England as early as the 1660s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Abbott Emerson|first=Smith|title=Colonists in Bondage: White Servitude and Convict Labor in America, 1607\u20131776|year=1947|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}</ref> supporting the theory that indentured servitude might have declined in some regions because of labor market dynamics.\n\n====Affordability of immigration====\nThe rise in the affordability of immigration reduced emigrants\u2019 need for external financing in the form of indentures. David Galenson's analysis on affordability shows that the cost of immigration from Britain to the United States over the course of the 18th century dropped from 50% of per capita income to less than 10%.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}  This is attributable to higher levels of real income in Europe (a result of economic growth in the 18th century) and to a sharp decline in transportation costs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [18]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref>\nInnovation had a strong impact on the ease and cost of passenger transportation, reducing the need of indentures. The railroad made non-port cities a much cheaper destination for immigrants. The steamboat was not necessarily cheaper than older sailing technologies, but it made transatlantic travel much easier and comfortable, an attractive factor for high-income classes (that could easily afford immigration without indentures).<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Philip|title=The Distant Magnet: European Immigration to the U.S.A|year=1971|publisher=Ayre & Spottiswoode|location=London}}</ref> \nThe British Navy's efforts against piracy also reduced transportation costs. Safer seas implied smaller crews (for there was no need to man weapons on board) and also reduced insurance costs (ships were at lower risk of being captured).\nThe composition of immigrants also shifted from single males towards entire families. Single males usually left their homes with little if any savings. Instead, families generally liquidated assets in Europe to finance their venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1\u201326 [21]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdb60180ed0b2ad29c5a8b89527f1151e0f2c982}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Salinger|first=Sharon V.|title=Colonial Labor in Transition: The Decline of Indentured Servitude in Late Eighteenth\u2010Century Philadelphia|journal=Labor History|year=1981|volume=22|issue=2|series=2|pages=165\u201391 [169]|doi=10.1080/00236568108584612}}</ref>\n\n====Impact of American Revolution====\nThe American Revolution severely limited immigration to the United States. Economic historians differ however on the long-term impact of the Revolution. Sharon Salinger argues that the economic crisis that followed the war made long-term labor contracts unattractive.

Existing slaves became indentured servants. That status was finally ended in 1827 and all the indentured obtained full freedom.<ref>See [https://web.archive.org/web/20101109220448/http://www.archives.nysed.gov/education/showcase/201011afamvoting/index.shtml \"African American Voting Rights (go down the page)]</ref>\n\nA number of acts passed by both the American and the British governments fostered the decline of indentures. The English Passenger Vessels Act of 1803, which regulated travel conditions aboard ships, attempted to make transportation more expensive in order to stop emigration. The American abolition of imprisonment of debtors by federal law (passed in 1833) made prosecution of runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/02/24/debtors-prisons-then-and-now-faq|title=Debtors' Prisons, Then and Now: FAQ|last=Congress|first=Library of|date=2015-02-24|website=The Marshall Project|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Richard B.|title=Labor Controls in Maryland in the Nineteenth Century|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume= 14| issue = 3|pages=385\u2013400|jstor=2197881|year=1948|doi=10.2307/2197881}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, most indentures of this nature occurred in the old [[Northwest Territory]]. The permissibility of such indentures centered on the interpretation of \"involuntary servitude\" per the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]], which declared:\n\n{{quote|There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the Party shall have been duly convicted.<ref name=Steinfeld />}}\n\nThe permissibility (or not) of penal sanctions in labor became an issue of \"fundamental law\", in which it was questioned whether those sanctions or specific performance enforcements turned indentured servitude into \"involuntary servitude\". At the time when the Northwest Ordinance was constructed, white adult servants were still being imported into the United States, and thus, historically, it seems likely that the Ordinance's framers considered indenture to be a form of \"voluntary\" servitude. In essence, this means the indentured servant chose to work for someone who bought them something.<ref name=Steinfeld />\n\nThe [[Territory of Hawaii]] was the last place in the United States to widely use indentures, as by 1900 the practice had been abolished in the rest of the country and replaced by alternatives such as the [[credit-ticket system]] used to transport Chinese laborers.<ref>Cloud, Patricia and David W. Galenson. \"Chinese Immigration and Contract Labor in the Late Nineteenth Century,\" ''Explorations in Economic History'' 24.1 (1987):  26, 39.</ref> Prior to U.S. annexation, indentures were widely used to transport Japanese contract workers to Hawaii for plantation work.

However, forceful indenture also provided part of the servants: contemporaries report that youngsters were sometimes tricked into servitude in order to be exploited in the colonies.<ref>Alexandre Olivier Ecquemelin, ''The History of Buccaneers in America'' (1853 edition), p. 46</ref>\n\nThe landowners on the islands would pay for a servant's passage and then provide the servant with food, clothes, shelter and instruction during the agreed term. The servant would then be required to work in the landowner's field for a term of bondage (usually four to seven years). During this term of bondage the servant had a status similar to a son of the master. For example, the servant was not allowed to marry without the master's permission. Servants could own personal property. They could also complain to a local magistrate about mistreatment that exceeded community norms. However, a servant's contract could be sold or given away by his master.\n\nAfter the servant's term was complete he became independent and was paid \"freedom dues\". These payments could take the form of land which would give the servant the opportunity to become an independent farmer or a free laborer.  As free men with little money they became a political force that stood in opposition to the rich planters.<ref>Lewis and Maingot (2004)  p. 97</ref>\n\nIndentured servitude was a common part of the social landscape in England and Ireland during the 17th century. During the 17th century, British and Irish went to [[Barbados]] as both masters and as indentured servants.

However, profit could still be made through the tobacco trade, which was what these small 25-acre farms did to live comfortably. The landowners\u2019 reputation as cruel masters became a deterrent to the potential indentured servant. In the 17th century, the islands became known as death traps, as between 33 and 50 percent of indentured servants died before they were freed, many from [[yellow fever]], [[malaria]] and other diseases.<ref name=burnard>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3788343?uid=3738776&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101834820177 A failed settler society: marriage and demographic failure in early Jamaica], ''[[Journal of Social History]]'',  Vol. 28, No. 1, Autumn, 1994, by Trevor Burnard</ref>\n\nWhen [[British Empire#Abolition of slavery|slavery ended in the British Empire]] in 1833, plantation owners turned to [[indentured servitude]] for inexpensive labor.

Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48673853|title=The football match that kicked off a war|first=Toby|last=Luckhurst|date=27 June 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence \"100 Hour War\"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.\n\n==Context==\nAlthough the nicjkname \"Football War\" implies that the conflict was due to a [[Association football|football]] match, the causes of the war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in [[Honduras]] and immigration and demographic problems in [[El Salvador]]. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 Salvadorans were likkkkkkving in Honduras. These Salvadorans made up 20% of the present population of Honduras.<ref>Acker, Allison. ''Honduras: The Making of a Banana Republic''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 1988.</ref>\n\nIn Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The [[United Fruit Company]] owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966 United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create la Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras (FENAGH; the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras). FENAGH was anti-peasantry (against the [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]) as well as anti-Salvadoran. This group put pressure on the Honduran president, Gen. [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], to protect the property rights of wealthy landowners.<ref name=Anderson-1981>Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1957''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.</ref>{{RP|64\u201375}}\n\nIn 1962 Honduras successfully enacted a new [[land reform]] law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/Honduras/pdfs/155709-206648.pdf|title=La Gaceta Dec. 5, 1962 (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans as specified by the Land Reform Law. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.\n\n==Buildup==\nIn June 1969, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in a two-leg [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].

El Salvador was put on a blackout and the [[Salvadoran Air Force]], using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers, attacked targets inside Honduras. Salvadoran air-raid targets included [[Toncont\u00edn International Airport]], which left the [[Honduran Air Force]] unable to react quickly. The larger [[Salvadoran Army]] launched major offensives along the two main roads connecting the two nations and invaded Honduras. The invasion phase was perpetrated by three main contingents: the Chalatenago Theater, the North Theater, and the East Theater. The Chalatenango Theater was based on the northwest side of El Salvador, including the departments of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], across the mountain range close to the border, and the [[Sumpul River]]. This was a strategic region due to its rich soil and climate; however, this Theater would not see any fighting as it was to deploy only in case of Honduran penetration into El Salvador. The North Theater was composed of a small unit of armored vehicles and a large amount of manpower. The East Theater was to deploy in the departments of [[La Uni\u00f3n Department|La Uni\u00f3n]] and [[Moraz\u00e1n Department|Moraz\u00e1n]]. This Theater was composed of a large mechanized division, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s such as the [[M3 Stuart]] and a large amount of artillery such as the [[105mm M101]].\n\nNicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] helped Honduras by providing weapons and ammunition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nInitially, rapid progress was made by the Salvadordoran army within striking distance of the Honduran capital [[Tegucigalpa]]. The momentum of the advance did not last, however.\n\nThe Honduran air force reacted by striking the Salvadoran [[Ilopango International Airport|Ilopango airbase]]. Honduran bombers attacked for the first time in the morning of 16 July. When the bombs began to fall, Salvadoran anti-air artillery started firing, repelling some of the bombers. The bombers had orders to attack the [[Acajutla]] Port, where the main oil facilities of El Salvador were based. Honduran air-raid targets also included minor oil facilities such as the ones in {{illm|Cutuco|es|Puerto Cutuco|ceb|Puerto Cutuco}}. By the evening of 16 July, huge pillars of smoke arose in the Salvadoran coastline from the burning oil depots that had been bombed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Chance vought corsair f4u-5n FAH-609.jpg|alt=|thumb|Honduran Air Force Vought F4U-5NL No. FAH-609 Corsair flown by Cap.

Soto entered a turning engagement with one Mustang and blew off its left wing with three bursts of 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#United States|AN/M3 cannon]], killing pilot Captain Douglas Varela when his parachute did not fully deploy. Later that day the pair spotted two Salvadoran [[Vought F4U Corsair|FG-1D Goodyear Corsairs]]. They jettisoned hard point stores before climbing and made a diving attack; Soto set one Corsair on fire only to find its wingman on his tail.

The OAS met in an urgent session on 18 July and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted OAS pressure for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July; it took full effect only on 20 July. El Salvador continued until 2 August to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.\n\n==Withdrawal==\n[[El Salvador]] finally withdrew its troops on 2 August 1969. On that date, [[Honduras]] guaranteed Salvadoran President [[Fidel S\u00e1nchez Hern\u00e1ndez]] that the Honduran government would provide adequate safety for the Salvadorans still living in Honduras. S\u00e1nchez had also asked that reparations be paid to the Salvadoran citizens as well, but that was never accepted by Hondurans. There were also heavy pressures from the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the debilitating repercussions that would take place if El Salvador continued to resist withdrawing their troops from Honduras.\n\n==Consequences==\nBoth sides of the Football War suffered extensive casualties. Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced; many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty.<ref name=Anderson-1981/>{{RP|145\u2013155}}\n\nEl Salvador suffered about 900 mostly civilian dead. Honduras lost 250 combat troops and over 2,000 civilians during the four-day war. Most of the war was fought on Honduran soil and thousands more were made homeless. Trade between Honduras and El Salvador had been greatly disrupted, and the border officially closed. This damaged the economies of these nations tremendously and threatened the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM).\n*The war resulted in a 22-year suspension of the CACM, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the [[Cuban Revolution]].\n*The political power of the military in both countries was reinforced. In the Salvadoran legislative elections that followed, candidates of the governing [[National Conciliation Party]] (''Partido de Conciliaci\u00f3n Nacional'', PCN) were largely drawn from the ranks of the military. Having apologized for their role in the conflict, they proved very successful in elections at the national and local levels. In contrast to the gradual democratization process that had characterized the 1960s, the military establishment would exercise increasing control.\n*The social situation in El Salvador worsened, as the government proved unable to satisfy the economic needs of its citizens deported from Honduras. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], which followed approximately a decade later.\n\n==Aftermath==\nEl Salvador was eliminated from the World Cup after losing their first three matches.<ref>{{cite web|title=1970 FIFA World Cup Mexico \u2122 - Groups - FIFA.com|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/mexico1970/groups/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nEleven years after the war the two nations signed a peace treaty in [[Lima, Peru]] on 30 October 1980<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/El_Salvador/pdfs/12624-26952.pdf |title=Diario Oficial Nov. 13, 1980(Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and five sections of land boundary through the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court's ruling was around {{convert|374.5|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of [[Tiger Island|El Tigre]], and El Salvador over the islands of [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera]] and Meanguerita.<ref name=\"Kawas\">{{cite web|author=Kawas, Jorge|title=El Salvador: Sovereignty issues over Gulf of Fonseca|date=18 March 2013|work=Pulsa Merica|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/|access-date=7 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409053158/http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/|archive-date=9 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President [[Porfirio Lobo]] of Honduras, President [[Otto P\u00e9rez]] of Guatemala, and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting.  However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.<ref name=\"Kawas\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|El Salvador}}\n*[[Guillermo Reynaldo Cortez]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Armstrong, Robert and Janet Shenk.

Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48673853|title=The football match that kicked off a war|first=Toby|last=Luckhurst|date=27 June 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence \"100 Hour War\"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.\n\n==Context==\nAlthough the nickname \"Football War\" implies that the conflict was due to a [[Association football|football]] match, the causes of the war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in [[Honduras]] and immigration and demographic problems in [[El Salvador]]. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 Salvadorans were likkkkkkving in Honduras. These Salvadorans made up 20% of the present population of Honduras.<ref>Acker, Allison. ''Honduras: The Making of a Banana Republic''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 1988.</ref>\n\nIn Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The [[United Fruit Company]] owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966 United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create la Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras (FENAGH; the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras). FENAGH was anti-peasantry (against the [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]) as well as anti-Salvadoran. This group put pressure on the Honduran president, Gen. [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], to protect the property rights of wealthy landowners.<ref name=Anderson-1981>Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1957''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.</ref>{{RP|64\u201375}}\n\nIn 1962 Honduras successfully enacted a new [[land reform]] law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/Honduras/pdfs/155709-206648.pdf|title=La Gaceta Dec. 5, 1962 (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans as specified by the Land Reform Law. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.\n\n==Buildup==\nIn June 1969, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in a two-leg [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].

El Salvador was put on a blackout and the [[Salvadoran Air Force]], using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers, attacked targets inside Honduras. Salvadoran air-raid targets included [[Toncont\u00edn International Airport]], which left the [[Honduran Air Force]] unable to react quickly. The larger [[Salvadoran Army]] launched major offensives along the two main roads connecting the two nations and invaded Honduras. The invasion phase was perpetrated by three main contingents: the Chalatenago Theater, the North Theater, and the East Theater. The Chalatenango Theater was based on the northwest side of El Salvador, including the departments of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], across the mountain range close to the border, and the [[Sumpul River]]. This was a strategic region due to its rich soil and climate; however, this Theater would not see any fighting as it was to deploy only in case of Honduran penetration into El Salvador. The North Theater was composed of a small unit of armored vehicles and a large amount of manpower. The East Theater was to deploy in the departments of [[La Uni\u00f3n Department|La Uni\u00f3n]] and [[Moraz\u00e1n Department|Moraz\u00e1n]]. This Theater was composed of a large mechanized division, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s such as the [[M3 Stuart]] and a large amount of artillery such as the [[105mm M101]].\n\nNicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] helped Honduras by providing weapons and ammunition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nInitially, rapid progress was made by the Salvadordoran army within striking distance of the Honduran capital [[Tegucigalpa]]. The momentum of the advance did not last, however.\n\nThe Honduran air force reacted by striking the Salvadoran [[Ilopango International Airport|Ilopango airbase]]. Honduran bombers attacked for the first time in the morning of 16 July. When the bombs began to fall, Salvadoran anti-air artillery started firing, repelling some of the bombers. The bombers had orders to attack the [[Acajutla]] Port, where the main oil facilities of El Salvador were based. Honduran air-raid targets also included minor oil facilities such as the ones in {{illm|Cutuco|es|Puerto Cutuco|ceb|Puerto Cutuco}}. By the evening of 16 July, huge pillars of smoke arose in the Salvadoran coastline from the burning oil depots that had been bombed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Chance vought corsair f4u-5n FAH-609.jpg|alt=|thumb|Honduran Air Force Vought F4U-5NL No. FAH-609 Corsair flown by Cap.

Soto entered a turning engagement with one Mustang and blew off its left wing with three bursts of 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#United States|AN/M3 cannon]], killing pilot Captain Douglas Varela when his parachute did not fully deploy. Later that day the pair spotted two Salvadoran [[Vought F4U Corsair|FG-1D Goodyear Corsairs]]. They jettisoned hard point stores before climbing and made a diving attack; Soto set one Corsair on fire only to find its wingman on his tail.

The OAS met in an urgent session on 18 July and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted OAS pressure for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July; it took full effect only on 20 July. El Salvador continued until 2 August to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.\n\n==Withdrawal==\n[[El Salvador]] finally withdrew its troops on 2 August 1969. On that date, [[Honduras]] guaranteed Salvadoran President [[Fidel S\u00e1nchez Hern\u00e1ndez]] that the Honduran government would provide adequate safety for the Salvadorans still living in Honduras. S\u00e1nchez had also asked that reparations be paid to the Salvadoran citizens as well, but that was never accepted by Hondurans. There were also heavy pressures from the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the debilitating repercussions that would take place if El Salvador continued to resist withdrawing their troops from Honduras.\n\n==Consequences==\nBoth sides of the Football War suffered extensive casualties. Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced; many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty.<ref name=Anderson-1981/>{{RP|145\u2013155}}\n\nEl Salvador suffered about 900 mostly civilian dead. Honduras lost 250 combat troops and over 2,000 civilians during the four-day war. Most of the war was fought on Honduran soil and thousands more were made homeless. Trade between Honduras and El Salvador had been greatly disrupted, and the border officially closed. This damaged the economies of these nations tremendously and threatened the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM).\n*The war resulted in a 22-year suspension of the CACM, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the [[Cuban Revolution]].\n*The political power of the military in both countries was reinforced. In the Salvadoran legislative elections that followed, candidates of the governing [[National Conciliation Party]] (''Partido de Conciliaci\u00f3n Nacional'', PCN) were largely drawn from the ranks of the military. Having apologized for their role in the conflict, they proved very successful in elections at the national and local levels. In contrast to the gradual democratization process that had characterized the 1960s, the military establishment would exercise increasing control.\n*The social situation in El Salvador worsened, as the government proved unable to satisfy the economic needs of its citizens deported from Honduras. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], which followed approximately a decade later.\n\n==Aftermath==\nEl Salvador was eliminated from the World Cup after losing their first three matches.<ref>{{cite web|title=1970 FIFA World Cup Mexico \u2122 - Groups - FIFA.com|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/mexico1970/groups/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nEleven years after the war the two nations signed a peace treaty in [[Lima, Peru]] on 30 October 1980<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/El_Salvador/pdfs/12624-26952.pdf |title=Diario Oficial Nov. 13, 1980(Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and five sections of land boundary through the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court's ruling was around {{convert|374.5|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of [[Tiger Island|El Tigre]], and El Salvador over the islands of [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera]] and Meanguerita.<ref name=\"Kawas\">{{cite web|author=Kawas, Jorge|title=El Salvador: Sovereignty issues over Gulf of Fonseca|date=18 March 2013|work=Pulsa Merica|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/|access-date=7 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409053158/http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/|archive-date=9 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President [[Porfirio Lobo]] of Honduras, President [[Otto P\u00e9rez]] of Guatemala, and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting.  However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.<ref name=\"Kawas\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|El Salvador}}\n*[[Guillermo Reynaldo Cortez]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Armstrong, Robert and Janet Shenk.
