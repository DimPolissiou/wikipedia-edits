The Bulldogs played their home games at [[Sanford Stadium]] in [[Athens, Georgia]], and competed in the Eastern Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by fourth-year head coach [[Kirby Smart]].\n\nGeorgia began the year ranked third in the [[AP Poll]], and were considered the favorite to represent the East Division in the SEC Championship Game for a third consecutive year. On September 21, the team secured a win over then-No. 7 [[2019 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], 23\u201317. They suffered their first loss of the year when they were upset by unranked [[2019 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]] at home. Georgia rebounded with wins over highly ranked rivals No. 6 [[2019 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] and No. 12 [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and ended the regular season atop the East Division with an 11\u20131 record, 7\u20131 in SEC play, and ranked fourth in the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]]. In the [[2019 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], Georgia fell to West Division champion and eventual national champion [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], 37\u201310. Georgia fell out of contention for the Playoff and received a bid to the [[2020 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] to play [[Big 12 Conference]] runner-up [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], which Georgia won 26\u201314. The Bulldogs were ranked fourth in the season's final polls.\n\nGeorgia led FBS in scoring defense, but was 49th in scoring offense.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2019-team-defense.html|title=2019 Team Defense|website=sports-reference.com|access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2019-team-offense.html|title=2019 Team Offense|website=sports-reference.com|access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref> Safety [[J.

In the [[2019 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], Georgia fell to West Division champion and eventual national champion [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], 37\u201310.

Smith''' (1894-1969), was an American regional artist, often associated with Cape Cod.  He was a [[World Psychiatric Association|WPA]] administrator and as an artist he was best known for his [[Relief|bas-relief]] woodcarvings.  His works also include oil paintings, watercolors, [[batik]] designs, and constructions in aluminum.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===  Early years ===\nBorn August 8, 1894 in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland, New York]],  Vernon Smith spent his early years in and around the [[Finger Lakes]] region.  In 1913, Smith began attending the [[Parsons The New School for Design|School of Fine and Applied Arts]] in New York City.  His painting instructors included [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], Howard Giles and [[Rae Sloan Bredin|Sloan Bredin]]. He learned metalwork, textile design, and interior decoration under the school's founder [[Frank Alvah Parsons|Frank Parsons]]. Smith taught for a year at the Manhattan School of Art.\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn April, 1918, Vernon Smith was conscripted into the Army and arrived at the front in July,  As a private, Smith's duties included camouflaging artillery and attending to mules. He often accompanied Sgt. Harry K. Fisk, a New York illustrator, to sketch advanced locations.\n\nAfter the war, Smith elected to stay in France where he spent time in Paris and then [[Poitiers]], where he enrolled at the Sorbonne Institute of Art.\n\nIn January 1920, Smith returned to New York City, where he met Doris Withycomb, who he later married.   After spending the summer running a tea shop in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown, Massachusetts]], Smith moved to [[Beacon Street]] in Boston, where he designed stage sets for the Peabody Playhouse.\n\n=== Cape Cod ===\n\nIn January 1922, at the invitation of Sally White Johnstone and [[Prescott Townsend]], Smith and Withycomb moved to [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]] on [[Cape Cod]] where they married and purchased a home.\n\nDuring his first decade on Cape Cod, Smith made his living designing [[batik]] fabrics and a product line of aluminum buckles and buttons.  He also opened a small antiques shop.  By 1927, the Smiths had three children:  Joy, Sara, and Peter.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Smith's neighbors on Monument Road organized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] congregation: The Church of the Holy Spirit.  Smith designed the small church and outfitted it with engraved sconces, carved pews, and a crucifix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecva.org/exhibition/acs/orleans_1.html|title=Episcopal Church Visual Arts|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  A small cultural movement formed on Monument Road which in addition to the church, included summer camps, an outdoor theater, and \"The Galley West,\" which sold local crafts including Smith's metal work.\n\n=== Federal Arts Project ===\nIn 1936, Smith was appointed supervisor of the Cape Cod artists on relief under the [[Federal Art Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-vernon-b-smith-11887|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> His charges ranged from \u201c[[Modernism|Modernists]]\u201d to \"[[Regionalism (art)|Regionalists]],\" which included among others:  [[Karl Knaths]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], Phillip Malicoat, [[Vernon Herbert Coleman]], George Yater, Eliot Orr, and Howard Gibbs.  He also associated with [[Ross Moffett]], [[Edwin Dickinson]], and [[Edward Hopper]] who he joined in group exhibitions and social activities.  Whitney E. Smith noted in his doctoral dissertation that \"The most important man for the Provincetown artists in [the FAP bureaucracy] was fellow-artist Vernon Smith.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2po7nSzMQC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=elliot+orr+artist&source=bl&ots=F19ns_te47&sig=37PLTDGb4JPkmq1WtRfa8u-IZ5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bzqHVeaXC5CyyASj_qSgAQ&ved=0CFoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=elliot%20orr%20artist&f=false|title = The Federal Art Project in Provincetown, Massachusetts: The Impact of a ...|date = May 6, 2009|accessdate = |website = Google Books|publisher = University of New Hampshire|last = Smith|first = Whitney E.}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Smith was selected as one of twelve FAP artists to tour the territory of Alaska and record their impressions.  With fellow artists Prescott Jones and [[Edwin Boyd Johnson|Edwin Johnson]], Smith traveled to Valdez, Fairbanks, and McKinley Park.  Artwork from the tour was distributed to federal facilities, with much of it remaining in Alaska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpamurals.com/alaska.htm|title=Alaska New Deal Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring the early years of WWII, Smith worked in a ball bearing factory in Connecticut.  While in Orleans, he volunteered for shore patrol.  Later, Smith performed civilian service at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, charting ocean currents and lettering maps.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nAfter the war, Smith was represented by the [[Kraushaar Galleries]] in New York City.  He had a one-man show there in 1946 and participated in other gallery shows throughout the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/kraushaar-galleries-records-7781/more|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Smith's wife became debilitated with [[multiple sclerosis]] and died.  That same year, Smith helped found the Cape Cod Art Association in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]] and served as its president in 1951.\n\nSmith continued throughout the 1950s to teach art classes at his private studio and in public schools. He continued his artwork and exhibited widely.\n\nIn 1949 he married for a second time to Gwen Barry from New York.  This second marriage ended in 1961, after which Smith began to divide his time between summers on Cape Cod and travels around the country the rest of the year.  He set up a studio in [[Corrales, New Mexico]] where his son Peter Smith lived.\n\nIn 1963, Smith acquired a new dealer for his art in Lester K. Henderson from [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]].  Several times Smith stayed in Carmel where he showed his work and took on commissions.\n\nIn 1965, Smith suffered a stroke while in New Mexico.  Partially paralyzed as a result, this ended his artistic output.  He returned to Cape Cod and lived under the care of his daughter, Sara Smith Joy.  He died in September 1969.  His ashes were interred under one of his soapstone carvings at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Orleans, Massachusetts.\n\n== Art work ==\n\n=== Early works ===\nFrom Smith's time in France, the few surviving canvases display influence of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]] school of landscape.  Other canvases, from his time at the Sorbonne Institute of Art, show the colorful, confident brushwork of a [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]].  His subjects were farms, peasants and flowering trees.\n\nFrom the 1920s, Smith's [[Batik]]s displayed themes from the ages of sailing ships and medieval fairy tale towns.  Crafts from this time consisted of hammered aluminum items such as buttons, buckles, serving trays, candle sconces, while from wood, Smith carved detailed display samples of classic cottage antiques.\n\n=== 1930s ===\nIn the early 1930s, Smith developed an \u201cantique\" style of painting.  Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped the surface of wet paint to create highlights.  [[Still life]]s featured antique props set up in his studio.  Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod.  Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly.  Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.\n\nSmith continued to refine his \"antique\" style and apply it to the [[social realism|Social Realism]] movement in the later 1930s.  Cultural artifacts of the era populate his paintings:  telephone poles, storefronts, jalopies, fishing draggers, and catboats describe scores of paintings that he produced while employed by the FAP.\n\nFrom his FAP tour of Alaska, Smith's work features the re-occurring motif of modern man's herculean, but puny efforts to tame the vast Alaskan wilderness.  His paintings and drawings are replete with boats, wharfs, automobiles, seaplanes, and dredges placed against backgrounds of towering mountains and wild rivers.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nReleased from the troubles of the war, Smith was reinvigorated with artistic activity.  Beginning with \u201cV-J Day\u201d and through a succession of oil paintings, Smith's works became populated with the citizenry of Orleans.  Scenes of square dancing, mending nets, trick-or-treating, raising roof-beams, deer hunting, sunbathing, and picnics celebrated the vibrant character of small town America.  His palette broadened, while his compositions became more playful with ever-increasing abstraction and differing perspectives.  Boats, fish nets, beach umbrellas, and musical instruments took on [[Cubism|cubist]] arrangements.  As noted by artist and Professor of Art History Tony Ververs, \"Smith used a personal adaption of a cubist idiom, much as did Lassell or Knaths... a common practice among early abstractionists.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Vernon Smith|last=Vevers|first=Tony|publisher=Provincetown Art Association and Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Provincetown, Massachusetts|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Smith began to carve stylized birds and whales.  This led to a major new direction for Smith.  Abstract motifs from his paintings appeared on flat wood panels, carved in [[bas-relief]].  \"The Sea,\u201d a depiction of a half-veiled female figure floating in a liquid cosmos, is an early example of his new technique.  Other panels combine ubiquitous spirals with clusters of shorebirds, or diving whales.  Smith carved in deep-silhouette and accented the depth with a tight color pallet.  Human mythologies appeared as well; as in \u201cLeda,\u201d where the graceful arc of a swan's neck arrives at a woman's nipple.  Again, Tony Vevers: \"the adoption of a new technique and medium gave Smith a sense of freedom; the rather hesitant abstraction of his earlier paintings become a major theme in his new work.\"<ref name=\":0\" />  Wood carved panels became Smith's principal form of expression until the end of his career.\n\nSmith executed a number of church commissions. He carved crucifixes of simple piety, and created panels based on the meditations of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. He interpreted the [[Stations of the Cross]] for a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College and revisited the Church of the Holy Spirit, carving a set of doors depicting the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] as a dove. In the late 1950s, Smith produced a series of carvings of ancient alphabets and [[alchemy]] symbols.\n\nInfluenced by his friendships with [[John Hay (nature writer)|John Hay]], [[Clare Leighton]], Harry Holl, and [[Betty Lane]], Smith's work shifted toward conservation and naturalist education in the early 1960s.  Cell forms, starbursts, and extraterrestrial craters appeared in his carvings. \u201cGrasshopper,\u201d with a micro view from the grasses, was created the same year as \u201cCosmos,\u201d a macro view through a telescope.\n\n=== New Mexico and Carmel ===\n\nFrom his travels in the 1960s, Smith expanded on his motifs.  From the American Southwest, the confluence of geology, history, and the Native American community led to panels populated with cactus and yucca plants, canyons, and [[Pueblo]]s.  \u201cPueblo Village\u201d and \u201cMesa Verde\u201d exemplify the carvings from his expeditions to the southwest.\n\nThe time spent on the west coast, mostly in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]], resulted in additional motifs \u2013 seals, surf, redwood forests, waterfalls, and rolling hills.\n\nSmith's artistic work ended in 1965.\n\n== Quotes by others on Vernon Smith ==\n<blockquote>\u201cSmith is one of the few artists today whose work has an enduring quality which lifts it above the passing fashions of various \u2018isms.\u2019 His sense of design and subtle use

Smith''' (1894-1969), was an American regional artist, often associated with Cape Cod.  He was a [[World Psychiatric Association|WPA]] administrator and as an artist he was best known for his [[Relief|bas-relief]] woodcarvings.  His works also include oil paintings, watercolors, [[batik]] designs, and constructions in aluminum.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===  Early Years ===\nBorn August 8, 1894 in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland, NY]],  Vernon Smith spent his early years in and around the [[Finger Lakes]] region.  In 1913, Smith began attending the [[Parsons The New School for Design|School of Fine and Applied Arts]] in New York City.  His painting instructors included [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], Howard Giles and [[Rae Sloan Bredin|Sloan Bredin]]. He learned metalwork, textile design, and interior decoration under the school's founder [[Frank Alvah Parsons|Frank Parsons]]. Smith taught for a year at the Manhattan School of Art.\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn April, 1918, Vernon Smith was conscripted into the Army and arrived at the front in July,  As a private, Smith's duties included camouflaging artillery and attending to mules. He often accompanied Sgt. Harry K. Fisk, a NY illustrator, to sketch advanced locations.\n\nAfter the war, Smith elected to stay in France where he spent time in Paris and then [[Poitiers]], where he enrolled at the Sorbonne Institute of Art.\n\nIn January 1920, Smith returned to New York City, where he met Doris Withycomb, who he later married.   After spending the summer running a tea shop in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown, MA]], Smith moved to [[Beacon Street]] in Boston, where he designed stage sets for the Peabody Playhouse.\n\n=== Cape Cod ===\n\nIn January 1922, at the invitation of Sally White Johnstone and [[Prescott Townsend]], Smith and Withycomb moved to [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]] on [[Cape Cod]] where they married and purchased a home.\n\nDuring his first decade on Cape Cod, Smith made his living designing [[batik]] fabrics and a product line of aluminum buckles and buttons.  He also opened a small antiques shop.  By 1927, the Smiths had three children:  Joy, Sara, and Peter.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Smith's neighbors on Monument Road organized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] congregation: The Church of the Holy Spirit.  Smith designed the small church and outfitted it with engraved sconces, carved pews, and a crucifix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecva.org/exhibition/acs/orleans_1.html|title=Episcopal Church Visual Arts|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  A small cultural movement formed on Monument Road which in addition to the church, included summer camps, an outdoor theater, and \"The Galley West,\" which sold local crafts including Smith's metal work.\n\n=== Federal Arts Project ===\nIn 1936, Smith was appointed supervisor of the Cape Cod artists on relief under the [[Federal Art Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-vernon-b-smith-11887|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> His charges ranged from \u201c[[Modernism|Modernists]]\u201d to \"[[Regionalism (art)|Regionalists]],\" which included among others:  [[Karl Knaths]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], Phillip Malicoat, [[Vernon Herbert Coleman]], George Yater, Eliot Orr, and Howard Gibbs.  He also associated with [[Ross Moffett]], [[Edwin Dickinson]], and [[Edward Hopper]] who he joined in group exhibitions and social activities.  Whitney E. Smith noted in his doctoral dissertation that \"The most important man for the Provincetown artists in [the FAP bureaucracy] was fellow-artist Vernon Smith.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2po7nSzMQC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=elliot+orr+artist&source=bl&ots=F19ns_te47&sig=37PLTDGb4JPkmq1WtRfa8u-IZ5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bzqHVeaXC5CyyASj_qSgAQ&ved=0CFoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=elliot%20orr%20artist&f=false|title = The Federal Art Project in Provincetown, Massachusetts: The Impact of a ...|date = May 6, 2009|accessdate = |website = Google Books|publisher = University of New Hampshire|last = Smith|first = Whitney E.}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Smith was selected as one of twelve FAP artists to tour the territory of Alaska and record their impressions.  With fellow artists Prescott Jones and [[Edwin Boyd Johnson|Edwin Johnson]], Smith traveled to Valdez, Fairbanks, and McKinley Park.  Artwork from the tour was distributed to federal facilities, with much of it remaining in Alaska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpamurals.com/alaska.htm|title=Alaska New Deal Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring the early years of WWII, Smith worked in a ball bearing factory in Connecticut.  While in Orleans, he volunteered for shore patrol.  Later, Smith performed civilian service at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, charting ocean currents and lettering maps.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nAfter the war, Smith was represented by the [[Kraushaar Galleries]] in New York City.  He had a one-man show there in 1946 and participated in other gallery shows throughout the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/kraushaar-galleries-records-7781/more|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Smith's wife became debilitated with [[multiple sclerosis]] and died.  That same year, Smith helped found the Cape Cod Art Association in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]] and served as its president in 1951.\n\nSmith continued throughout the 1950s to teach art classes at his private studio and in public schools. He continued his artwork and exhibited widely.\n\nIn 1949 he married for a second time to Gwen Barry from New York.  This second marriage ended in 1961, after which Smith began to divide his time between summers on Cape Cod and travels around the country the rest of the year.  He set up a studio in [[Corrales, New Mexico]] where his son Peter Smith lived.\n\nIn 1963, Smith acquired a new dealer for his art in Lester K. Henderson from [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]].  Several times Smith stayed in Carmel where he showed his work and took on commissions.\n\nIn 1965, Smith suffered a stroke while in New Mexico.  Partially paralyzed as a result, this ended his artistic output.  He returned to Cape Cod and lived under the care of his daughter, Sara Smith Joy.  He died in September 1969.  His ashes were interred under one of his soapstone carvings at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Orleans, MA.\n\n== Art work ==\n\n=== Early works ===\nFrom Smith's time in France, the few surviving canvases display influence of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]] school of landscape.  Other canvases, from his time at the Sorbonne Institute of Art, show the colorful, confident brushwork of a [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]].  His subjects were farms, peasants and flowering trees.\n\nFrom the 1920s, Smith's [[Batik]]s displayed themes from the ages of sailing ships and medieval fairy tale towns.  Crafts from this time consisted of hammered aluminum items such as buttons, buckles, serving trays, candle sconces, while from wood, Smith carved detailed display samples of classic cottage antiques.\n\n=== 1930s ===\nIn the early 1930s, Smith developed an \u201cantique\" style of painting.  Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped the surface of wet paint to create highlights.  [[Still life]]s featured antique props set up in his studio.  Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod.  Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly.  Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.\n\nSmith continued to refine his \"antique\" style and apply it to the [[social realism|Social Realism]] movement in the later 1930s.  Cultural artifacts of the era populate his paintings:  telephone poles, storefronts, jalopies, fishing draggers, and catboats describe scores of paintings that he produced while employed by the FAP.\n\nFrom his FAP tour of Alaska, Smith's work features the re-occurring motif of modern man's herculean, but puny efforts to tame the vast Alaskan wilderness.  His paintings and drawings are replete with boats, wharfs, automobiles, seaplanes, and dredges placed against backgrounds of towering mountains and wild rivers.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nReleased from the troubles of the war, Smith was reinvigorated with artistic activity.  Beginning with \u201cV-J Day\u201d and through a succession of oil paintings, Smith's works became populated with the citizenry of Orleans.  Scenes of square dancing, mending nets, trick-or-treating, raising roof-beams, deer hunting, sunbathing, and picnics celebrated the vibrant character of small town America.  His palette broadened, while his compositions became more playful with ever-increasing abstraction and differing perspectives.  Boats, fish nets, beach umbrellas, and musical instruments took on [[Cubism|cubist]] arrangements.  As noted by artist and Professor of Art History Tony Ververs, \"Smith used a personal adaption of a cubist idiom, much as did Lassell or Knaths... a common practice among early abstractionists.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Vernon Smith|last=Vevers|first=Tony|publisher=Provincetown Art Association and Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Provincetown, MA|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Smith began to carve stylized birds and whales.

It revolves around \"present-day\" contract killers called \"loopers\" hired by criminal syndicates from the future to terminate victims whom they send back through time.\n\n''Looper'' was selected as the opening film of the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on September 28, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/looper-sets-september-2012-release-date|title=US Release Date|date=June 9, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pissedoffgeek.com/?p=5713|title=UK Release Date|date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> The film  received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $176 million worldwide on a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As of March 2020, this Plot section has less than 600 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, please keep the word count below 700. -->\nIn 2044, 25-year-old Joe works for a [[Kansas City]] [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]] as a \"looper\". Since future [[tracking system]]s have made it nearly impossible to dispose of victims' bodies, the syndicate uses [[time travel]]. Managed by a man from the future named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of victims whose faces are concealed. The assassins are paid with [[Silver as an investment|silver bars]] that are strapped to their targets. To prevent connections to the syndicate, a looper's final victim will be his or her retired future self. These targets are identified by [[gold bar]]s strapped to them instead of silver. Killing one's future self ends the contract and \"closes the loop\".\n\nJoe's friend Seth confesses to Joe that he has not killed his future self. Old Seth has escaped, after warning Seth that a person in the future called the Rainmaker will overthrow the five major [[Boss (crime)|bosses]] and close all loops. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's floor safe, but when Kid Blue, one of Abe's elite \"Gat Men\", takes Joe to Abe, Joe reveals Seth's location. Abe's men cut an address into younger Seth's arm and then begin severing body parts. These effects appear on Old Seth's body; he goes to the address that has  appeared on his arm and is killed.\n\nWhen Joe's next target arrives, it is his older self, but with his face uncovered and hands unbound. Old Joe escapes before Joe can kill him. Returning to his apartment, Joe fights with Kid Blue, falls off a [[fire escape]] and blacks out.\n\nIn another timeline, Joe does kill his older self. He moves to [[Shanghai]] and becomes a hitman to finance his drug addiction and wild lifestyle. Eventually, he marries. Seven years later, his wife is killed when Joe is taken to close the loop. Overpowering his captors, Old Joe sends himself back to 2044, [[Alternate history|altering his history]] by evading Joe and escaping.\n\nOld Joe experiences vague memories of Joe's actions in the present, and meets his younger self at a diner. He wants to alter history again and save his wife by killing the Rainmaker as a child. He has a map. Kid Blue and the Gat Men appear, and a gunfight ensues. Both Joes escape, with pieces of the map.\n\nJoe follows the map to a farm where Sara and her son, Cid, live. Sara recognizes numbers on the map as Cid's birthday and birth hospital's zip code.  Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born at that hospital on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker.\n\nJesse, a Gat Man, comes to the farm, but Cid and Joe hide. Later that night, Sara and Joe have sex, and Sara reveals that she has above-average telekinetic powers. Cid's powers are even stronger. In the morning, Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint. Terrified, Cid kills Jesse using telekinesis. Joe realizes that Cid will become the Rainmaker and that Old Joe will now know this.\n\nKid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free, killing Abe and his henchmen, and goes to Sara's farm, followed by Kid Blue. While Young Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid. When Cid's face is grazed by a bullet, Sara calms him before he can react and kill them. She sends Cid into the cane field and stands between Old Joe and her son. Joe realizes that Sara's death will turn Cid into the Rainmaker. He [[Suicide|commits suicide]], erasing Old Joe's existence, saving Sara and preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Joe\n** [[Bruce Willis]] as Old Joe\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Sara\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Seth\n** Frank Brennan as Old Seth\n* [[Noah Segan]] as Kid Blue\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Suzie\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Abe\n* [[Pierce Gagnon]] as Cid\n* [[Xu Qing|Summer Qing]] as Joe's Wife\n* [[Tracie Thoms]] as Beatrix\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Jesse\n* [[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]] as Dale\n* Marcus Hester as Zach\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rian Johnson & Joseph Gordon-Levitt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaking at [[WonderCon]] 2012 in promotion of ''Looper''.]]\n''Looper'' was written and directed by [[Rian Johnson]].

Stern]]. It stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] and [[Emily Blunt]]. It revolves around \"present-day\" contract killers called \"loopers\" hired by criminal syndicates from the future to terminate victims whom they send back through time.\n\n''Looper'' was selected as the opening film of the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on September 28, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/looper-sets-september-2012-release-date|title=US Release Date|date=June 9, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pissedoffgeek.com/?p=5713|title=UK Release Date|date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> The film  received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $176 million worldwide on a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As of March 2020, this Plot section has less than 600 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, please keep the word count below 700. -->\nIn 2044, 25-year-old Joe works for a [[Kansas City]] [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]] as a \"looper\". Since future [[tracking system]]s have made it nearly impossible to dispose of victims' bodies, the syndicate uses [[time travel]]. Managed by a man from the future named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of victims whose faces are concealed. The assassins are paid with [[Silver as an investment|silver bars]] that are strapped to their targets. To prevent connections to the syndicate, a looper's final victim will be his or her retired future self. These targets are identified by [[gold bar]]s strapped to them instead of silver. Killing one's future self ends the contract and \"closes the loop\".\n\nJoe's friend Seth confesses to Joe that he has not killed his future self. Old Seth has escaped, after warning Seth that a person in the future called the Rainmaker will overthrow the five major [[Boss (crime)|bosses]] and close all loops. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's floor safe, but when Kid Blue, one of Abe's elite \"Gat Men\", takes Joe to Abe, Joe reveals Seth's location. Abe's men cut an address into younger Seth's arm and then begin severing body parts. These effects appear on Old Seth's body; he goes to the address that has  appeared on his arm and is killed.\n\nWhen Joe's next target arrives, it is his older self, but with his face uncovered and hands unbound. Old Joe escapes before Joe can kill him. Returning to his apartment, Joe fights with Kid Blue, falls off a [[fire escape]] and blacks out.\n\nIn another timeline, Joe does kill his older self. He moves to [[Shanghai]] and becomes a hitman to finance his drug addiction and wild lifestyle. Eventually, he marries. Seven years later, his wife is killed when Joe is taken to close the loop. Overpowering his captors, Old Joe sends himself back to 2044, [[Alternate history|altering his history]] by evading Joe and escaping.\n\nOld Joe experiences vague memories of Joe's actions in the present, and meets his younger self at a diner. He wants to alter history again and save his wife by killing the Rainmaker as a child. He has a map. Kid Blue and the Gat Men appear, and a gunfight ensues. Both Joes escape, with pieces of the map.\n\nJoe follows the map to a farm where Sara and her son, Cid, live. Sara recognizes numbers on the map as Cid's birthday and hospital code.  Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born at that hospital on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker.\n\nJesse, a Gat Man, comes to the farm, but Cid and Joe hide. Later that night, Sara and Joe have sex, and Sara reveals that she has above-average telekinetic powers. Cid's powers are even stronger. In the morning, Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint. Terrified, Cid kills Jesse using telekinesis. Joe realizes that Cid will become the Rainmaker and that Old Joe will now know this.\n\nKid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free, killing Abe and his henchmen, and goes to Sara's farm, followed by Kid Blue. While Young Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid. When Cid's face is grazed by a bullet, Sara calms him before he can react and kill them. She sends Cid into the cane field and stands between Old Joe and her son. Joe realizes that Sara's death will turn Cid into the Rainmaker. He [[Suicide|commits suicide]], erasing Old Joe's existence, saving Sara and preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Joe\n** [[Bruce Willis]] as Old Joe\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Sara\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Seth\n** Frank Brennan as Old Seth\n* [[Noah Segan]] as Kid Blue\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Suzie\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Abe\n* [[Pierce Gagnon]] as Cid\n* [[Xu Qing|Summer Qing]] as Joe's Wife\n* [[Tracie Thoms]] as Beatrix\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Jesse\n* [[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]] as Dale\n* Marcus Hester as Zach\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rian Johnson & Joseph Gordon-Levitt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaking at [[WonderCon]] 2012 in promotion of ''Looper''.]]\n''Looper'' was written and directed by [[Rian Johnson]].

For ''Looper'', I very much wanted it to be a more character-based movie that is more about how these characters dealt with the situation time travel has brought about.

Council has also indicated its willingness to obtain legal title to the lathe in perpetuity, from the Minister for Planning, to assist their active care and long term management of the item. The Heritage Branch has identified this action as being beneficial to the long-term care, display and public enjoyment of the lathe.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nEurobodalla Shire Council has obtained planning permission to display the item in a public outdoor setting adjacent to the Moruya Historical Society building near Campbell Street, Moruya. Transfer of the item will require later Heritage Council approval under section 57 and/or section 60 of the Act. Under the Heritage Act, transfer of an item of environmental heritage from the control of the Minister and the corporation to another party requires the recommendation of the Heritage Council of NSW under section 116(2). The Heritage Council agreed to recommend the disposal of the item at its meeting of 4 November 2009.<ref name=nswshr-942-1310>Item 2.4</ref> The Minister wrote to Eurobodalla Council in March 2010 to formally transfer title.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nRecords indicate that the lathe was last used at Loveridge & Hudson's Yard in Sydney in the 1960s. It is unclear whether the Lathe was ever situated near the main source of granite at Moruya, or whether it was always located in Sydney. The Moruya Antique Tractor and Machinery Association (MATMA) suggests that a collection of historic photographs show the Lathe situated at Louttit's quarry, Moruya, at one stage.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nFor many years the lathe was in limbo its last known use was at the stonemasonry firm of Loveridge and Hudson in Sydney during the 1960s.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nThe firm was registered in 1882, just after the lathe's construction. Did they order and ship it to Australia at that time. the company records are lost today.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nThe lathe is however attributed to turning the stone columns for some of Sydney's most majestic buildings. The extension of the Sydney GPO in the 1880s, the Queen Victoria Building (1898), [[Circular Quay railway station]] (early 1900s), and the [[Martin Place]] Savings Bank (1925), amongst others. At this time, suggestions are that the lathe was based in Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nWas it always that way? There is some thought that it had once been at Louttit's Quarry on the banks of the [[Moruya River]]. We do know that it turned Moruya granite and we know that by 1977 the Sydney company of Loveridge and Hudson had donated it to the then growing Lachlan Vintage Village in Forbes, an [[Old Sydney Town]]-type heritage village. The lathe was in Sydney at that time. Here its fortunes were a little more certain, until the village owners sold it to a local scrap metal business a decade later in 1987. Heritage enthusiasts including the [[NSW Public Works|Department of Public Works]] and the National Trust, lamented the lathe's loss.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nThe Hon. [[Bob Carr]], then Minister for Heritage, placed an Order over the historic monument that year under the Heritage Act. The Heritage Council under its then Chair Justice Hope stepped in and purchased it and it was given a stay of life in the Village grounds.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nWith Lachlan Vintage Village's verging collapse, the lathe was once again in jeopardy. Calls to remove it were made from 1991. The relocation of the lathe to Moruya in May 2010 was made possible by the coming together of key community members and the local Council to rescue this important part of New South Wales' industrial heritage. Local groups recognised the importance of this item to the local area and were instrumental in starting the dialogue to get the lathe relocated.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nIt is fitting then that the Heritage Council, which saved the lathe from scrapping in the 1980s, could assist by recommending to the Minister that it be transferred to Eurobodalla for final display and protection.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:942 - Abernethy and Co Stonemason's Lathe - Abernethy & Co Stonemason's Lathe (5014131b1).jpg|thumb|Abernethy & Co Stonemason's Lathe]]\nA lathe for turning large stone [[columns]].

The lathe was reassembled at the Lachlan Vintage Village, Forbes, following recognition of its significance. In 1999, the lathe was transferred to the State Heritage Register under the Act.<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n\nThe Heritage Council resolved at its 4 November 2009 meeting to recommend that the Minister:<ref name=nswshr-942/>\n*acting as a corporation sole under section 102 of the NSW Heritage Act 1977, transfers title of the Abernethy Stonemason's Lathe from the corporation sole to [[Eurobodalla Shire]] Council.\n\nThe Abernethy Stonemason's Lathe is the only moveable item of its type known to have survived in Australia.
