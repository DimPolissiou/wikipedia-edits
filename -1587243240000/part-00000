He was also the presidential nominee of the left-wing [[Progressive Party 1948 (United States)|Progressive Party]] in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]].\n\nThe oldest son of [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], who served as the U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1921 to 1924, Henry A. Wallace was born in [[Adair County, Iowa]] in 1888. After graduating from [[Iowa State University]] in 1910, Wallace worked as a writer and editor for his family's farm journal, ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''. He also founded the [[DuPont Pioneer|Hi-Bred Corn Company]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[corn]] company that eventually became extremely successful. Wallace displayed an intellectual curiosity about a wide array of subjects, including statistics and economics, and he explored various religious and spiritual movements, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. After the death of his father in 1924, Wallace increasingly drifted away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]].\n\nWallace served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Roosevelt from 1933 to 1940. He strongly supported Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and presided over a major shift in federal agricultural policy, implementing measures designed to curtail agricultural surpluses and ameliorate rural poverty. Overcoming strong opposition from conservative party leaders, Wallace was nominated for Vice President at the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace triumphed in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], and Wallace continued to play an important role in the Roosevelt administration before and during [[World War II]]. At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], conservative party leaders defeated Wallace's bid for re-nomination, replacing him on the Democratic ticket with [[Harry S. Truman]]. The ticket of Roosevelt and Truman won the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], and in early 1945 Roosevelt appointed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.\n\nRoosevelt died in April 1945 and was succeeded by Truman. Wallace continued to serve as secretary of commerce until September 1946, when Truman fired him for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies towards the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |website=Senate.gov |title=Henry Agard Wallace, 33rd Vice President (1941-1945) |publisher=Senate Historical Office |date=2017-05-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325001919/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |archivedate=2019-03-25 |accessdate=2019-03-25 }}</ref> Wallace and his supporters established the Progressive Party and launched a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] campaign for president. The Progressive party platform called for conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union, [[School integration in the United States|desegregation of public schools]], [[racial equality|racial]] and [[gender equality]], [[free trade]], a [[national health insurance]] program, and other left-wing policies. Accusations of [[Communism|Communist]] influences and Wallace's association with controversial Theosophist figure [[Nicholas Roerich]] undermined his campaign, and he received just 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. Wallace broke with the Progressive Party in 1950 over the [[Korean War]], and in 1952 he published ''Where I Was Wrong'', in which he declared the Soviet Union to be \"utterly evil.\" Wallace largely fell into political obscurity after the early 1950s, though he continued to make public appearances until the year before his death in 1965.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWallace was born on October 7, 1888 on a farm near [[Orient, Iowa]], to [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]] and his wife, May.<ref>Southwick (1998), p. 620</ref> Wallace had two younger brothers and three younger sisters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 23\u201324</ref> His paternal grandfather, \"Uncle Henry\" Wallace, was an important landowner, newspaper editor, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist, and [[Social Gospel]] advocate in [[Adair County, Iowa]]. Uncle Henry's father, John Wallace, was an [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Scots immigrant]] from the village [[Kilrea]] in [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]] who arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in 1823.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 3\u201310</ref> May (n\u00e9e Broadhead) was born in [[New York City]] but was raised by an aunt in [[Muscatine, Iowa]] after the death of her parents.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWallace's family moved to [[Ames, Iowa]], in 1892 and to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1896. In 1894, the Wallaces established an agricultural newspaper known as ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 11\u201317</ref> The newspaper became extremely successful and made the Wallace family wealthy and politically influential.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Wallace took a strong interest in agriculture and plants from a young age, and he befriended [[African-American]] botanist [[George Washington Carver]], with whom he frequently talked about plants and other subjects.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 13\u201314</ref> Wallace was particularly interested in [[corn]], the key crop in Iowa. In 1904, he devised an experiment that disproved agronomist [[Perry Greeley Holden]]'s assertion that the most aesthetically pleasing corn would produce the greatest yield.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 26\u201329</ref> Wallace graduated from West High School in 1906 and enrolled in [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] later that year, majoring in animal husbandry. He joined the Hawkeye Club, a fraternal organization, and spent much of his free time continuing his study of corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 29\u201334</ref> He also organized a political club in support of [[Gifford Pinchot]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] Republican who served as the head of the [[United States Forest Service]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Journalist and farmer==\n[[File:H. C. Wallace (retouched).jpg|thumb|Wallace's father, [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], served as secretary of agriculture from 1921 to his death in 1924.]]\n\nWallace became a full-time writer and editor for the family-owned paper, ''Wallace's Farmer'', after he graduated college in 1910. He was deeply interested in using mathematics and economics in agriculture, and he learned [[calculus]] as part of an effort to understand [[hog (swine)|hog]] prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 37\u201339</ref> He also wrote an influential article with pioneering statistician [[George W. Snedecor]] on computational methods for [[correlation]]s and [[regression analysis|regressions]]<ref>{{Cite journal |first1 = Henry Agard |last1 = Wallace |first2 = George Waddel |last2 = Snedecor |title = Correlation and Machine Calculation |journal = Iowa State College Bulletin |volume = 35 |year = 1925 }}</ref> After the death of his grandfather in 1916, Wallace became the co-editor of ''Wallace's Farmer'' alongside his father.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 42\u201344</ref> In 1921, Wallace assumed leadership of the family paper after his father accepted appointment as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|secretary of agriculture]] under President [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 53\u201355</ref> His uncle lost ownership of the paper in 1932 due to the effects of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and Wallace stopped serving as editor of the paper in 1933.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 92\u201393, 110</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Wallace and his wife purchased a farm near [[Johnston, Iowa]]; they initially attempted to combine corn production with dairy farming, but later turned their full attention to corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Influenced by [[Edward Murray East]], Wallace focused on the production of hybrid corn, developing a hybrid corn known as Copper Cross. In 1923, Wallace reached the first ever contract for hybrid seed production when he agreed to grant the Iowa Seed Company the sole right to grow and sell Copper Cross corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 67\u201370</ref> In 1926, he co-founded the [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Hi-Bred Corn Company]] to develop and produce hybrid corn. Though it initially turned only a small profit, the Hi-Bred Corn Company eventually became a massive financial success.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 82\u201383</ref>\n\n==Early political involvement==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Wallace and his father helped the [[United States Food Administration]] (USFA) to develop policies to increase hog production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 46\u201348</ref> After USFA director [[Herbert Hoover]] abandoned the hog production policies favored by the Wallaces, the elder Wallace joined an effort to deny Hoover the presidential nomination at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]]. Partly as a response to Hoover, Wallace published ''Agricultural Prices'', in which he advocated government policies to control agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 50\u201352</ref> He also warned farmers of an imminent price collapse following the end of the war. Wallace's prediction proved accurate, as the postwar period saw the beginning of a farm crisis that extended into the 1920s. Reflecting a broader decrease in agricultural prices, the price of corn fell from $1.68 per bushel in 1918 to 42 cents per bushel in 1921.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 52\u201353</ref> Wallace proposed various remedies to combat the farm crisis, which he believed stemmed primarily from overproduction by farmers. Among his proposed policies was the \"[[ever-normal granary]],\" a policy under which the government buys and stores agricultural surpluses during periods of low agricultural prices and sells those surpluses during periods of high agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 56\u201359</ref>\n\nBoth Wallaces backed the [[McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill]], which would have required the federal government to market and export agricultural surpluses in foreign markets. The bill was defeated in large part due to the opposition of President [[Calvin Coolidge]], who became president after President Harding's death in 1923.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 62\u201363</ref> Wallace's father died in October 1924, and in the November [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]], Henry Wallace voted for [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate [[Robert La Follette]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 64\u201365, 71</ref> Partly due to Wallace's continued lobbying, Congress passed the McNary\u2013Haugen bill in 1927 and 1928, but President Coolidge vetoed the bill both times.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 84\u201385</ref> Dissatisfied with both major party candidates in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], Wallace tried to get Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois to seek the presidency. He ultimately supported Democratic nominee [[Al Smith]], but Republican Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chiles |first1=Robert |title=Courting the Farm Vote on the Northern Plains: Presidential Candidate Al Smith, Governor Walter Maddock, and the Ambivalent Politics of 1928 |journal=North Dakota History |date=Spring 2016 |volume=81 |issue=1 |page=23 |url=https://www.history.nd.gov/publications/ndrecent.html}}</ref><ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 86\u201387</ref> The onset of the Great Depression during [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover's administration]] devastated Iowa farmers as farm income fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], Wallace campaigned for Democrat [[Franklin D.

Roosevelt}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election, he appointed Wallace as secretary of agriculture.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 105\u2013107</ref> Despite his past affiliation with the Republican Party, Wallace strongly supported President Roosevelt and his [[New Deal]] domestic program, and he became a registered member of the Democratic Party in 1936.<ref>Kennedy (1999), p. 457</ref> Upon taking office, Wallace appointed [[Rexford Tugwell]], a member of Roosevelt's \"[[Brain Trust]]\" of important advisers, as his deputy secretary. Though Roosevelt was initially focused primarily on addressing the banking crisis, Wallace and Tugwell convinced the president of the necessity of quickly passing major agricultural reforms.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 113\u2013114</ref> Roosevelt, Wallace, and [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]] Chairman [[John Marvin Jones]] rallied congressional support around the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], which established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 115\u2013119</ref> The aim of the AAA was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity by using a system of \"domestic allotments\" that set the total output of agricultural products. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Depression and New Deal in Virginia.'' (1983) p. 107</ref> Farm incomes increased significantly in the first three years of the New Deal, as prices for commodities rose.<ref>Anthony Badger, ''The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933\u20131940'' (2002) p. 89. 153-57</ref> After the passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Department of Agriculture became the single largest department in the federal government.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 120\u2013122</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down the Agricultural Adjustment Act in the 1936 case of ''[[United States v. Butler]]''. Wallace strongly disagreed with the Court's holding that agriculture was a \"purely local activity\" and thus could not be regulated by the federal government, stating that \"were agriculture truly a local matter in 1936, as the Supreme Court says it is, half of the people of the United States would quickly starve.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 157\u2013160</ref> Nonetheless, he quickly proposed a new agriculture program designed to meet the Supreme Court's objections; under the new program, the federal government would reach rental agreements with farmers to plant [[green manure]] rather than crops like corn and wheat. Less than two months after the Supreme Court handed down ''United States v.

In early 1942, Roosevelt established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate war-time production, and named [[Donald Nelson]], rather than Wallace, as the head of the board. Wallace became a member of the War Production Board and continued to serve as head of the BEW, which was charged with procuring and protecting the natural resources necessary for war production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 269\u2013271</ref> Wallace struggled to carve out authority for the BEW, clashing with both the State Department and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 271\u2013273</ref> On May 8, 1942, Wallace delivered what became his best remembered speech, known for containing the phrase \"the Century of the Common Man\". He cast World War II as a war between a \"free world\" and a \"slave world,\" and held that \"peace must mean a better standard of living for the common man, not merely in the United States and England, but also in India, Russia, China, and Latin America\u2013not merely in the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]], but also in Germany and Italy and Japan.\" Though some conservatives disliked the speech, it was translated into twenty languages, and millions of copies were distributed around the world.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 275\u2013279</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, Wallace was dispatched on a goodwill tour of Latin America; he made twenty-four stops across [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. Partly due to his ability to deliver speeches in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Wallace received a warm reception; one State Department official noted that \"never in [[Chile|Chilean]] history has any foreigner ever been received with such extravagance and evidently sincere enthusiasm.\" During his trip, several Latin American countries declared war against Germany.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 296\u2013300</ref> After a long, public battle between Wallace and RFC head [[Jesse H.

With his congressional allies, he led passage of the [[Employment Act of 1946]]. Although conservatives blocked the inclusion of a measure providing for [[full employment]], the act established the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]] to study economic matters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 395\u2013396</ref> Wallace's proposal to establish [[Baruch Plan|international control over nuclear weapons]] was not adopted, but he did help pass the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]], which established the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] to oversee domestic development of nuclear power.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 404\u2013406, 427</ref>\n\nWorld War II came to an end in September 1945 with the [[Surrender of Japan]], and relations with the Soviet Union became a central matter of foreign policy.

He was also the presidential nominee of the left-wing [[Progressive Party 1948 (United States)|Progressive Party]] in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]].\n\nThe oldest son of [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], who served as the U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1921 to 1924, Henry A. Wallace was born in [[Adair County, Iowa]] in 1888. After graduating from [[Iowa State University]] in 1910, Wallace worked as a writer and editor for his family's farm journal, ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''. He also founded the [[DuPont Pioneer|Hi-Bred Corn Company]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[corn]] company that eventually became extremely successful. Wallace displayed an intellectual curiosity about a wide array of subjects, including statistics and economics, and he explored various religious and spiritual movements, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. After the death of his father in 1924, Wallace increasingly drifted away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]].\n\nWallace served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Roosevelt from 1933 to 1940. He strongly supported Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and presided over a major shift in federal agricultural policy, implementing measures designed to curtail agricultural surpluses and ameliorate rural poverty. Overcoming strong opposition from conservative party leaders, Wallace was nominated for Vice President at the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace triumphed in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], and Wallace continued to play an important role in the Roosevelt administration before and during [[World War II]]. At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], conservative party leaders defeated Wallace's bid for re-nomination, replacing him on the Democratic ticket with [[Harry S. Truman]]. The ticket of Roosevelt and Truman won the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], and in early 1945 Roosevelt appointed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.\n\nRoosevelt died in April 1945 and was succeeded by Truman. Wallace continued to serve as secretary of commerce until September 1946, when Truman fired him for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies towards the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |website=Senate.gov |title=Henry Agard Wallace, 33rd Vice President (1941-1945) |publisher=Senate Historical Office |date=2017-05-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325001919/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |archivedate=2019-03-25 |accessdate=2019-03-25 }}</ref> Wallace and his supporters established the Progressive Party and launched a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] campaign for president. The Progressive party platform called for conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union, [[School integration in the United States|desegregation of public schools]], [[racial equality|racial]] and [[gender equality]], [[free trade]], a [[national health insurance]] program, and other left-wing policies. Accusations of [[Communism|Communist]] influences and Wallace's association with controversial Theosophist figure [[Nicholas Roerich]] undermined his campaign, and he received just 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. Wallace broke with the Progressive Party in 1950 over the [[Korean War]], and in 1952 he published ''Where I Was Wrong'', in which he declared the Soviet Union to be \"utterly evil.\" Wallace largely fell into political obscurity after the early 1950s, though he continued to make public appearances until the year before his death in 1965.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWallace was born on October 7, 1888 on a farm near [[Orient, Iowa]], to [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]] and his wife, May.<ref>Southwick (1998), p. 620</ref> Wallace had two younger brothers and three younger sisters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 23\u201324</ref> His paternal grandfather, \"Uncle Henry\" Wallace, was an important landowner, newspaper editor, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist, and [[Social Gospel]] advocate in [[Adair County, Iowa]]. Uncle Henry's father, John Wallace, was an [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Scots immigrant]] from the village [[Kilrea]] in [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]] who arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in 1823.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 3\u201310</ref> May (n\u00e9e Broadhead) was born in [[New York City]] but was raised by an aunt in [[Muscatine, Iowa]] after the death of her parents.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWallace's family moved to [[Ames, Iowa]], in 1892 and to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1896. In 1894, the Wallaces established an agricultural newspaper known as ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 11\u201317</ref> The newspaper became extremely successful and made the Wallace family wealthy and politically influential.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Wallace took a strong interest in agriculture and plants from a young age, and he befriended [[African-American]] botanist [[George Washington Carver]], with whom he frequently talked about plants and other subjects.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 13\u201314</ref> Wallace was particularly interested in [[corn]], the key crop in Iowa. In 1904, he devised an experiment that disproved agronomist [[Perry Greeley Holden]]'s assertion that the most aesthetically pleasing corn would produce the greatest yield.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 26\u201329</ref> Wallace graduated from West High School in 1906 and enrolled in [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] later that year, majoring in animal husbandry. He joined the Hawkeye Club, a fraternal organization, and spent much of his free time continuing his study of corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 29\u201334</ref> He also organized a political club in support of [[Gifford Pinchot]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] Republican who served as the head of the [[United States Forest Service]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Journalist and farmer==\n[[File:H.

Partly as a response to Hoover, Wallace published ''Agricultural Prices'', in which he advocated government policies to control agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 50\u201352</ref> He also warned farmers of an imminent price collapse following the end of the war. Wallace's prediction proved accurate, as the postwar period saw the beginning of a farm crisis that extended into the 1920s. Reflecting a broader decrease in agricultural prices, the price of corn fell from $1.68 per bushel in 1918 to 42 cents per bushel in 1921.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 52\u201353</ref> Wallace proposed various remedies to combat the farm crisis, which he believed stemmed primarily from overproduction by farmers. Among his proposed policies was the \"[[ever-normal granary]],\" a policy under which the government buys and stores agricultural surpluses during periods of low agricultural prices and sells those surpluses during periods of high agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 56\u201359</ref>\n\nBoth Wallaces backed the [[McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill]], which would have required the federal government to market and export agricultural surpluses in foreign markets.

In early 1942, Roosevelt established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate war-time production, and named [[Donald Nelson]], rather than Wallace, as the head of the board. Wallace became a member of the War Production Board and continued to serve as head of the BEW, which was charged with procuring and protecting the natural resources necessary for war production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 269\u2013271</ref> Wallace struggled to carve out authority for the BEW, clashing with both the State Department and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 271\u2013273</ref> On May 8, 1942, Wallace delivered what became his best remembered speech, known for containing the phrase \"the Century of the Common Man\".

With his congressional allies, he led passage of the [[Employment Act of 1946]].

Though Wallace was not a member of the PCA, he was widely regarded as the organization's leader and was criticized for the PCA's acceptance of Communist members.

He served as a United States Senator from 1971 to 1989 and as the [[List of Governors of Florida|41st Governor of Florida]] from 1991 to 1998.\n\nA [[Korean War]] veteran, Chiles later returned to Florida for law school and eventually opened his own private practice in 1955. Three years later, Chiles entered politics with a successful bid for the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1958, as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nBy 1966, Chiles left the Florida House to run for the [[Florida Senate]]. Despite 12 years in the [[Florida Legislature]], Chiles was relatively unknown when he decided to bid for [[1970 United States Senate election in Florida|United States Senate in 1970]]. He embarked on a 1,003-mile walk from [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] for his campaign, earning him the nickname \"Walkin' Lawton\". It was successful and Chiles defeated his opponent [[William C. Cramer]] by a 53.9%-46.1% margin. Chiles retired from the United States Senate and from politics entirely in 1989.\n\nHowever, supporters convinced him to run for Governor of Florida in [[1990 Florida gubernatorial election|1990]] against the unpopular incumbent [[Bob Martinez]], and Chiles defeated Martinez by a 13-point margin (56.5% to 43.5%). During his first term as Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles brought reform to health care in the state and oversaw recovery efforts from [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. Chiles faced a tough [[1994 Florida gubernatorial election|re-election bid in 1994]] against [[Jeb Bush]], who was a businessman and son of former [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. Chiles prevailed over Bush by fewer than 64,000 votes. In his second term, Chiles was known for his reforms to education in Florida. On December 12, 1998, he suffered a [[heart attack]] and died at the [[Florida Governor's Mansion]], leaving [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Buddy MacKay]] to serve the remaining 23 days of Chiles' unexpired term.\n\n==Early life==\nChiles was born in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], Florida near [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], the son of Margaret Kate (n\u00e9e Patterson) and Lawton Mainor Chiles. He attended public school at Lakeland High School, then the [[University of Florida]] at [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]. At the University of Florida, he was active in student politics. Chiles was a member of Phi Delta Phi International Legal Honor Society Cockrell Inn and was inducted into both the university Hall of Fame (the most prestigious honor a student can receive at UF) and [[Florida Blue Key]].\n\nHe was a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity. He graduated in 1952. Following his college years, Chiles entered the [[Korean War]], commissioned as an artillery officer in the [[United States Army]]. After the war, Chiles returned to the University of Florida for [[law school]], from which he graduated in 1955; he passed the state bar exam that year and went into private practice in Lakeland. He married [[Rhea Chiles|Rhea Grafton]].\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1958, Chiles, a Democrat, was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]].<ref>http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000356</ref> It was essentially still a one-party state, as most African Americans were [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by a constitution and laws passed since the turn of the century.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4__EYITWk4C&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=Effects+of+southern+black+disfranchisement+on+1912+presidential+election&source=bl&ots=F31l2NP4PO&sig=cAQNnWwy2xvEHNUKD-ULjOp0OKo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T6grU6LbDpKCyAGpv4GgCg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Effects%20of%20southern%20black%20disfranchisement%20on%201912%20presidential%20election&f=false Richard M.

During his time in the state legislature, Chiles continued to work as a lawyer and developer in Lakeland. He was one of the initial investors in the [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] restaurant chain.<ref>http://www.theledger.com/article/20140516/newschief/140519390</ref> He was a member of the Florida Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].<ref>http://connecticutsar.org/about/what-sar-means/</ref>\n\n==The 1,003-mile walk==\n[[File:Lawton Chiles Shoes.jpg|right|thumb|Pair of Lawton Chiles' walking shoes on display at the [[Florida State Capitol]].]]\nIn 1970, Chiles decided to run for a seat in the [[United States Senate]]. At the time, despite his 12 years in the state legislature, he was largely unknown outside his Lakeland-based district. To generate some media coverage and meet people across the state, Chiles embarked upon a 1,003-mile, 91-day walk across Florida from [[Pensacola]] to [[Key West]]. The walk earned him the recognition he sought, as well as the nickname that would follow him throughout his political career\u2013 \"Walkin' Lawton\". In his journal Chiles wrote that sometimes he walked alone, while other times he met ordinary Floridians along the way. In later years, Chiles would recall the walk allowed him to see Florida's natural beauty, as well as the state's problems, with fresh eyes. Some Florida reporters said that Chiles enjoyed campaigning much more than governing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Richard|title=Florida Gov.

Cramer==\nIn the general election campaign, Chiles faced [[U.S. Representative]] [[William C. Cramer]] of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to have served in Congress from Florida since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]]. Cramer, a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]], questioned Chiles's votes as a state senator on several matters regarding insurance. One law increased automobile liability rates by 50 percent over two years, and another raised premiums for school bus insurance, at a time that Chiles's insurance agency in Lakeland held the policy on the [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]] School Board, but such \"conflict-of-interest\" accusations seemed to have little political effect.<ref>''[[Miami Herald]]'', October 10, 1970; ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'', October 10, 18, 1970</ref>\n\nThe self-made Cramer depicted Chiles as coming from a \"silver spoon\" background with a then net worth of $300,000, but the media ignored questions about the candidates' personal wealth.<ref>''Miami Herald'', October 23, 1970; ''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970</ref> Instead, reporters focused on the walk, often termed a \"public relations stroke of genius.\" Prior to the walk,  Chiles was identified by only 5 percent of voters; afterwards, he had widespread positive recognition.<ref>Alexander P Lamis, ''The Two-Party South'', p. 185; ''Miami Herald'', September 9, 1970; ''Tallahassee Democrat'', September 6 and November 1, 1970.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' forecast correctly that Chiles's \"weary feet and comfortable hiking boots\" would  carry the 40-year-old \"slow-country country lawyer\" with \"boyish amiability\", and \"back-country common sense and methodical urbane political savvy\" to victory.<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970</ref> Chiles's \"[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huck Finn]]\" image was contrasted one night in Miami when he held a fried chicken picnic while the Republicans showcased a black-tie $1,000-a-plate dinner.<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 27, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer could not match Chiles's public appeal. An observer described Cramer's \"charisma\" as \"a speech in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.\" A Cramer aide said it was difficult \"selling experience. It's not a sexy thing.\"<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970; ''Miami Herald'', September 4, 1970</ref> A Chiles advertisement urged that voters \"Vote for yourself. Chiles walked our streets and highways to hear what you have to say. That's why a vote for Chiles is like a vote for yourself.\"<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 27, 1970</ref> With \"shoe leather and a shoestring budget\", Chiles presented himself as a \"problem solver who doesn't automatically vote 'No' on every issue.\"<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 9 and October 29, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer said that he should have demanded more debates and rebuffed the walking tactic: \"I never could get that turned around.  He was walking, and I was running. But the press was enamored with the walk ... Every time he was asked a question about where he stood, he would quote somebody that he met on the campaign trail to state what he was to do when he got to the Senate consistent with what that constituent had said.  The basic approach gave him more credibility to his walk, which had nothing to do with his qualifications for the Senate but gave him free publicity and appealed to the 'little man.'\"<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970\", ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (April 1990), p. 418</ref>\n\nWith [[ecology]] a national concern by 1970, Chiles announced his opposition to the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which had originally been supported by every member of the Florida congressional delegation. The project, one-third completed, was cancelled early in 1971 and is now a protected [[green belt]] corridor. Chiles endorsed federal funding to remove waste from the [[bass (fish)|bass]]-teeming [[Lake Apopka]] in central Florida. By contrast, Cramer received little credit from environmentalists  although he had drafted the Water Pollution Control Act of 1956 and had sponsored legislation to protect [[alligator]]s, stop beach erosion, dredge harbors, and remove oil spills. Instead, Cramer's critics accused him of having weakened anti-pollution laws. Cramer questioned Chiles's opposition to a proposed [[severance tax]] on [[phosphate]] mining, which particularly impacted [[Tampa Bay]]. Cramer declared that \"Liberal Lawton has protected the phosphate industry -- the state's single largest polluter.\"<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\" p. 418; \"Bill Cramer ... Who Else?\", campaign brochure of Cramer senatorial campaign, 1970</ref>\n\nBy 1974, a survey showed Floridians favored limits on development, and 60 percent urged more government funding for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]].<ref>Jack Bass and [[Walter DeVries]], ''The Transformation of Southern Politics: Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945'' (New York, 1976), p. 116</ref>\n\nOnly three newspapers\u2014in Orlando, Fort Myers, and Pasco County\u2014supported Cramer in the race against Chiles.<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\", p. 419</ref> In the face of media opposition, Cramer failed to pin the \"[[Liberal (politics)|liberal]]\" label on Chiles, who called himself by the rare hybrid term \"progressive conservative.\"<ref>Numan V. Bartley and Hugh D. Graham, ''Southern Politics and the Second Reconstruction'' ([[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], 1975), pp. 146-147; ''Miami Herald'',  October 27, 1970</ref> Explaining Cramer's inability to make \"liberalism\" an issue in 1970, ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that Chiles and his successful gubernatorial running mate, [[Reubin Askew]] of Pensacola \"convey amiable good ol' boy qualities with moderate-to-liberal aspirations that do not strike fear into the hearts of conservatives.\"<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 1970</ref>\n\nChiles relied heavily on his support from the retiring Senator Spessard Holland. He noted that Cramer had expected to face former Governor [[Farris Bryant]], who like [[LeRoy Collins]] in 1968, Gurney's foe, had ties to the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Bryant lost the senatorial primary to Chiles. \"I'm not anything Cramer thought he would be running against. So he's reduced to telling lies about me,\" Chiles quipped.<ref>''Cramer v. Kirk,\" p. 419</ref> Chiles said that Cramer can bring [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Spiro T. Agnew|Agnew]], [[Ronald W. Reagan|Reagan]], and anybody else he wants. ... I'll take Holland on my side against all of them.\"<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', September 30, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer said a Republican-majority Senate would lead to the removal of controversial Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] of [[Arkansas]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] who had long opposed the [[Vietnam War]]. Chiles, however, retorted that if Republicans controlled the Senate other southern Democrats would also forfeit committee chairmanships earned through their seniority.<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\", p. 420</ref>\n\n==The Senate==\n\nChiles was twice re-elected to the U.S. Senate -- 1976 and 1982, both heavily Democratic years. Chiles, never flashy, was considered a moderate lawmaker who rarely made waves. He served as the chairman of the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]] of the 96th Congress (1979\u201381), and in the 100th Congress (1987\u201389) served as chairman of the influential [[United States Senate Committee on Budget|Senate Budget Committee]].

He retired from the Senate in 1989 and intended to retire from politics entirely. However, several supporters convinced him to enter the 1990 Florida Governor's race against [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[Bob Martinez]]. During the Democratic Party primary, his opponent [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] attempted to make an issue of Chiles' age and health, a strategy that backfired badly in a state with a large population of retirees.\n\nChiles ran a campaign to \"reinvent\" the state's government, and defeated Martinez to take office in 1991. During his first term as governor, Chiles managed to accomplish very little. Although he developed ambitious health-care and tax reform packages, neither passed in the hostile state legislature. The early years of his term were troubled by a national economic recession that severely damaged Florida's tourism-based economy, and by [[Hurricane Andrew]], which struck near [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] in August, 1992.\n\nChiles ran for re-election in 1994 against [[Jeb Bush]]. He defeated Bush by a narrow 64,000 vote margin with 50.75% of the popular vote. As of 2017, his victory remains the last by a Democratic candidate in a Florida gubernatorial election. Republican candidate Bush ran a television advertisement which featured the mother of a teenage girl who had been abducted and murdered many years before. The mother stated that \"Her killer is still on death row, and we're still waiting for justice. We won't get it from Lawton Chiles because he's too liberal on crime\", referring to Chiles not signing the convicted killer's death warrant. Chiles, then governor, responded that he did not sign a death warrant because the case was still on appeal. The Democratic governor further claimed a record of support for the death penalty, having presided over 18 executions during his two terms (among them the first Floridian woman executed since 1848). Moreover, after the botched electrocution of [[Pedro Medina]] in 1997, and despite significant public criticism, Chiles refused to endorse the use of [[lethal injection]] as a lawful form of execution.  The new method was introduced under Bush's administration in 1999 after the execution of [[Allen Lee Davis]].\n\nChiles' second term as governor was notable as the first time in state history that a Democratic governor had a legislature controlled by the Republican Party. Despite this, he had some successes, including a successful lawsuit he and state [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] filed against the [[tobacco industry]], which resulted in an $11.3&nbsp;billion settlement for the state. He also won approval for a $2.7&nbsp;billion statewide school construction program. In 1995 Chiles sought treatment for a neurological problem, after he awoke with nausea, slurred speech and loss of coordination. He recovered fully.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rhea Chiles embracing her son Bud Chiles during the funeral of Lawton Chiles.jpg|thumb|[[Rhea Chiles]] embracing her son Bud during the funeral of Lawton Chiles, on December 15, 1998.]]\n\nIneligible to run a third time, Chiles supported the [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida|lieutenant governor]], his personal friend [[Buddy MacKay]], in the [[1998 Florida gubernatorial election|1998 Florida governor's race]] against [[Jeb Bush]]. Bush, however, scored an easy victory over MacKay. On December 12 that year, just three weeks before his long-awaited retirement was to begin, Chiles suffered a fatal heart attack while exercising on a cycling machine in the Governor's Mansion gymnasium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lawton Chiles 1930-1998|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=December 13, 1998|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-12-13-9812130101-story.html}}</ref>\n\nFuneral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], on December 16, 1998 following a funeral procession that traced part of his walk from the 1970 Senate campaign, from the panhandle town of [[Century, Florida|Century]] to Tallahassee.

He emphasized health coverage for the uninsured and led a campaign to create the National Commission for Prevention of Infant Mortality in the late 1980s. In 1994 he fought for the creation of regional health care alliances throughout the state, which allow small businesses to pool their health care dollars and broaden coverage while saving money. He also created the Florida Department of Elder Affairs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zHnlBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=florida+department+of+elder+affairs+lawton+chiles#v=onepage&q=florida%20department%20of%20elder%20affairs%20lawton%20chiles&f=false|title=Florida Governors: Lasting Legacies|last=Buccellato|first=Robert|date=2015-02-02|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439649534|location=|pages=112|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Chiles created the Florida Healthy Start program to provide a comprehensive prenatal and infant care program available to all pregnant women and infants across the state; since the program's inception the state's [[infant mortality]] rate has dropped 18%. In 1996, Chiles appointed a Governor's Commission on Education to examine the state's school system. One of the significant recommendations that came from that commission eventually led to the highly controversial 2002 [[Florida Constitution|state constitutional]] amendment restricting Florida's school class sizes.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 1997, [[anti-abortion]] [[advocacy group]] ''[[Choose Life (organization)|Choose Life]]'' collected 10,000 signatures and filed the $30,000 fee required under Florida law at the time to submit an application for a new specialty plate. State Senator [[Tom Lee (Florida politician)|Tom Lee]] sponsored a bill in support of the tag's creation. The bill passed both houses of the [[Florida State Legislature]] in early 1998, but was vetoed by Chiles, who stated that license plates are not the \"proper forum for debate\" on political issues.<ref>Gielow-Jacobs, Leslie:  [http://www.flr.law.ufl.edu/pdf/jacobs-article.pdf \"Free Speech and the Limits of Legislative Discretion: The Example of Specialty License Plates\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912101844/http://www.flr.law.ufl.edu/pdf/jacobs-article.pdf |date=September 12, 2006 }} Florida Law Review, 53(3) pages 419\u2013432</ref><ref>Lithwick, Dahlia: [http://www.slate.com/id/2078247 \"Poetic Licenses\"], Slate.com, February 6, 2003; retrieved June 23, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Judicial appointments===\nPerhaps his greatest legacy was his impact on the [[Florida Supreme Court]], where his appointments continued to have a major impact on state and national events long after Chiles' death. Chiles appointed Justice [[Major B. Harding]] in 1991, Justice [[Charles T. Wells]] in 1994, Justice [[Harry Lee Anstead]] in 1994, Justice [[Barbara J. Pariente]] in 1997, and Justice [[R. Fred Lewis]] in 1998.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Chiles and incoming Gov. Jeb Bush jointly appointed Justice [[Peggy A. Quince]] in 1998 just a few days before Chiles' death. Quince was jointly appointed because her term as Justice would begin the exact moment that Bush's first term as governor began, so there was a legal question which governor had the authority to appoint her. Bush and Chiles agreed to make a joint appointment to avoid a lawsuit over the question.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridasupremecourt.org/News-Media/Court-News/Justice-Quince-Appointed-20-Years-Ago|title=Justice Quince Appointed 20 Years Ago|website=Supreme Court|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThus, at one point, Chiles had appointed five of the seven Justices and had jointly appointed the sixth. Chiles' appointments formed the Supreme Court majorities that decided the following major cases:\n* In 2006, the Court struck down a law passed by the [[Florida State Legislature]] that had created the United States' first statewide [[education voucher]] program. The majority in this case consisted of Wells, Anstead, Pariente, Lewis, and Quince. Bush appointees [[Raoul G. Cantero]] and [[Kenneth B. Bell]] dissented.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n* In 2004, the court struck down another piece of legislation from the Florida legislature designed to reverse a lower court decision in the [[Terri Schiavo case]].

Hagan was the daughter of Chiles' sister Jeannette. Chiles' son, \"Bud\" Chiles, ran for the position of Governor of Florida without party affiliation in a grassroots campaign. Like his father, Bud embarked on a walking tour of the state, listening and visiting with local communities in Florida.<ref>[http://walkwithbud.com/ Bud's campaign website]</ref> On September 2, 2010, Chiles dropped out of the race citing \"continuing down this road could have unintended consequences, dividing those who hold common goals...\" Chiles threw his support behind [[Alex Sink]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/09/02/1804546/chiles-throws-support-to-sink.html \"Chiles throws support to Sink in Fla. gov's race\"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, miamiherald.com, September 2, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n'''Democratic primary for United States Senator from Florida, 1970'''\n* [[C.

He served as a United States Senator from 1971 to 1989 and as the [[List of Governors of Florida|41st Governor of Florida]] from 1991 to 1998.\n\nA [[Korean War]] veteran, Chiles later returned to Florida for law school and eventually opened his own private practice in 1955. Three years later, Chiles entered politics with a successful bid for the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1958, as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nBy 1966, Chiles left the Florida House to run for the [[Florida Senate]]. Despite 12 years in the [[Florida Legislature]], Chiles was relatively unknown when he decided to bid for [[1970 United States Senate election in Florida|United States Senate in 1970]]. He embarked on a 1,003-mile walk from [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] for his campaign, earning him the nickname \"Walkin' Lawton\". It was successful and Chiles defeated his opponent [[William C. Cramer]] by a 53.9%-46.1% margin. Chiles retired from the United States Senate and from politics entirely in 1989.\n\nHowever, supporters convinced him to run for Governor of Florida in [[1990 Florida gubernatorial election|1990]] against the unpopular incumbent [[Bob Martinez]], and Chiles defeated Martinez by a 13-point margin (56.5% to 43.5%). During his first term as Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles brought reform to health care in the state and oversaw recovery efforts from [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. Chiles faced a tough [[1994 Florida gubernatorial election|re-election bid in 1994]] against [[Jeb Bush]], who was a businessman and son of former [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. Chiles prevailed over Bush by fewer than 64,000 votes. In his second term, Chiles was known for his reforms to education in Florida. On December 12, 1998, he suffered a [[heart attack]] and died at the [[Florida Governor's Mansion]], leaving [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Buddy MacKay]] to serve the remaining 23 days of Chiles' unexpired term.\n\n==Early life==\nChiles was born in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], Florida near [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], the son of Margaret Kate (n\u00e9e Patterson) and Lawton Mainor Chiles. He attended public school at Lakeland High School, then the [[University of Florida]] at [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]. At the University of Florida, he was active in student politics. Chiles was a member of Phi Delta Phi International Legal Honor Society Cockrell Inn and was inducted into both the university Hall of Fame (the most prestigious honor a student can receive at UF) and [[Florida Blue Key]].\n\nHe was a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity. He graduated in 1952. Following his college years, Chiles entered the [[Korean War]], commissioned as an artillery officer in the [[United States Army]]. After the war, Chiles returned to the University of Florida for [[law school]], from which he graduated in 1955; he passed the state bar exam that year and went into private practice in Lakeland. He married [[Rhea Chiles|Rhea Grafton]].\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1958, Chiles, a Democrat, was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]].<ref>http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000356</ref> It was essentially still a one-party state, as most African Americans were [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by a constitution and laws passed since the turn of the century.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4__EYITWk4C&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=Effects+of+southern+black+disfranchisement+on+1912+presidential+election&source=bl&ots=F31l2NP4PO&sig=cAQNnWwy2xvEHNUKD-ULjOp0OKo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T6grU6LbDpKCyAGpv4GgCg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Effects%20of%20southern%20black%20disfranchisement%20on%201912%20presidential%20election&f=false Richard M.

During his time in the state legislature, Chiles continued to work as a lawyer and developer in Lakeland. He was one of the initial investors in the [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] restaurant chain.<ref>http://www.theledger.com/article/20140516/newschief/140519390</ref> He was a member of the Florida Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].<ref>http://connecticutsar.org/about/what-sar-means/</ref>\n\n==The 1,003-mile walk==\n[[File:Lawton Chiles Shoes.jpg|right|thumb|Pair of Lawton Chiles' walking shoes on display at the [[Florida State Capitol]].]]\nIn 1970, Chiles decided to run for a seat in the [[United States Senate]]. At the time, despite his 12 years in the state legislature, he was largely unknown outside his Lakeland-based district. To generate some media coverage and meet people across the state, Chiles embarked upon a 1,003-mile, 91-day walk across Florida from [[Pensacola]] to [[Key West]]. The walk earned him the recognition he sought, as well as the nickname that would follow him throughout his political career\u2013 \"Walkin' Lawton\". In his journal Chiles wrote that sometimes he walked alone, while other times he met ordinary Floridians along the way. In later years, Chiles would recall the walk allowed him to see Florida's natural beauty, as well as the state's problems, with fresh eyes. Some Florida reporters said that Chiles enjoyed campaigning much more than governing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Richard|title=Florida Gov.

Cramer==\nIn the general election campaign, Chiles faced [[U.S. Representative]] [[William C. Cramer]] of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to have served in Congress from Florida since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]]. Cramer, a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]], questioned Chiles's votes as a state senator on several matters regarding insurance. One law increased automobile liability rates by 50 percent over two years, and another raised premiums for school bus insurance, at a time that Chiles's insurance agency in Lakeland held the policy on the [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]] School Board, but such \"conflict-of-interest\" accusations seemed to have little political effect.<ref>''[[Miami Herald]]'', October 10, 1970; ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'', October 10, 18, 1970</ref>\n\nThe self-made Cramer depicted Chiles as coming from a \"silver spoon\" background with a then net worth of $300,000, but the media ignored questions about the candidates' personal wealth.<ref>''Miami Herald'', October 23, 1970; ''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970</ref> Instead, reporters focused on the walk, often termed a \"public relations stroke of genius.\" Prior to the walk,  Chiles was identified by only 5 percent of voters; afterwards, he had widespread positive recognition.<ref>Alexander P Lamis, ''The Two-Party South'', p. 185; ''Miami Herald'', September 9, 1970; ''Tallahassee Democrat'', September 6 and November 1, 1970.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' forecast correctly that Chiles's \"weary feet and comfortable hiking boots\" would  carry the 40-year-old \"slow-country country lawyer\" with \"boyish amiability\", and \"back-country common sense and methodical urbane political savvy\" to victory.<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970</ref> Chiles's \"[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huck Finn]]\" image was contrasted one night in Miami when he held a fried chicken picnic while the Republicans showcased a black-tie $1,000-a-plate dinner.<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 27, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer could not match Chiles's public appeal. An observer described Cramer's \"charisma\" as \"a speech in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.\" A Cramer aide said it was difficult \"selling experience. It's not a sexy thing.\"<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', November 1, 1970; ''Miami Herald'', September 4, 1970</ref> A Chiles advertisement urged that voters \"Vote for yourself. Chiles walked our streets and highways to hear what you have to say. That's why a vote for Chiles is like a vote for yourself.\"<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 27, 1970</ref> With \"shoe leather and a shoestring budget\", Chiles presented himself as a \"problem solver who doesn't automatically vote 'No' on every issue.\"<ref>''Miami Herald'', September 9 and October 29, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer said that he should have demanded more debates and rebuffed the walking tactic: \"I never could get that turned around.  He was walking, and I was running. But the press was enamored with the walk ... Every time he was asked a question about where he stood, he would quote somebody that he met on the campaign trail to state what he was to do when he got to the Senate consistent with what that constituent had said.  The basic approach gave him more credibility to his walk, which had nothing to do with his qualifications for the Senate but gave him free publicity and appealed to the 'little man.'\"<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970\", ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (April 1990), p. 418</ref>\n\nWith [[ecology]] a national concern by 1970, Chiles announced his opposition to the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which had originally been supported by every member of the Florida congressional delegation. The project, one-third completed, was cancelled early in 1971 and is now a protected [[green belt]] corridor. Chiles endorsed federal funding to remove waste from the [[bass (fish)|bass]]-teeming [[Lake Apopka]] in central Florida. By contrast, Cramer received little credit from environmentalists  although he had drafted the Water Pollution Control Act of 1956 and had sponsored legislation to protect [[alligator]]s, stop beach erosion, dredge harbors, and remove oil spills. Instead, Cramer's critics accused him of having weakened anti-pollution laws. Cramer questioned Chiles's opposition to a proposed [[severance tax]] on [[phosphate]] mining, which particularly impacted [[Tampa Bay]]. Cramer declared that \"Liberal Lawton has protected the phosphate industry -- the state's single largest polluter.\"<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\" p. 418; \"Bill Cramer ... Who Else?\", campaign brochure of Cramer senatorial campaign, 1970</ref>\n\nBy 1974, a survey showed Floridians favored limits on development, and 60 percent urged more government funding for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]].<ref>Jack Bass and [[Walter DeVries]], ''The Transformation of Southern Politics: Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945'' (New York, 1976), p. 116</ref>\n\nOnly three newspapers\u2014in Orlando, Fort Myers, and Pasco County\u2014supported Cramer in the race against Chiles.<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\", p. 419</ref> In the face of media opposition, Cramer failed to pin the \"[[Liberal (politics)|liberal]]\" label on Chiles, who called himself by the rare hybrid term \"progressive conservative.\"<ref>Numan V. Bartley and Hugh D. Graham, ''Southern Politics and the Second Reconstruction'' ([[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], 1975), pp. 146-147; ''Miami Herald'',  October 27, 1970</ref> Explaining Cramer's inability to make \"liberalism\" an issue in 1970, ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that Chiles and his successful gubernatorial running mate, [[Reubin Askew]] of Pensacola \"convey amiable good ol' boy qualities with moderate-to-liberal aspirations that do not strike fear into the hearts of conservatives.\"<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 1970</ref>\n\nChiles relied heavily on his support from the retiring Senator Spessard Holland. He noted that Cramer had expected to face former Governor [[Farris Bryant]], who like [[LeRoy Collins]] in 1968, Gurney's foe, had ties to the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Bryant lost the senatorial primary to Chiles. \"I'm not anything Cramer thought he would be running against. So he's reduced to telling lies about me,\" Chiles quipped.<ref>''Cramer v. Kirk,\" p. 419</ref> Chiles said that Cramer can bring [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Spiro T. Agnew|Agnew]], [[Ronald W. Reagan|Reagan]], and anybody else he wants. ... I'll take Holland on my side against all of them.\"<ref>''Tallahassee Democrat'', September 30, 1970</ref>\n\nCramer said a Republican-majority Senate would lead to the removal of controversial Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] of [[Arkansas]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] who had long opposed the [[Vietnam War]]. Chiles, however, retorted that if Republicans controlled the Senate other southern Democrats would also forfeit committee chairmanships earned through their seniority.<ref>\"Cramer v. Kirk\", p. 420</ref>\n\n==The Senate==\n\nChiles was twice re-elected to the U.S. Senate -- 1976 and 1982, both heavily Democratic years. Chiles, never flashy, was considered a moderate lawmaker who rarely made waves. He served as the chairman of the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]] of the 96th Congress (1979\u201381), and in the 100th Congress (1987\u201389) served as chairman of the influential [[United States Senate Committee on Budget|Senate Budget Committee]]. While heading the Budget Committee, he played a key role in the 1987 revision of the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings]] Act.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/26/opinion/bye-bye-gramm-rudman-hollings.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Bye-Bye, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings|date=1987-02-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1987-07-23-8703010896-story.html|title=BUDGET IMPASSE MAY LEAD TO DELAY OF BENEFIT CHECKS|last=Bureau|first=KEN CUMMINS, Washington|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Chiles underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple-bypass heart surgery]]. After his recovery, he became increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of work in the Senate, complaining that it was too difficult to get anything done. He hence announced in December 1987 that he would not seek re-election the next year.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/25/us/tax-repeal-on-services-in-florida-widely-felt.html], [[New York Times]], December 25, 1987; retrieved on May 5, 2009.</ref> Chiles was succeeded by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Connie Mack III|Connie Mack]].\n\n==Governor of Florida==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nAfter the surgery, Chiles developed clinical depression,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C0CE2D81F3FF937A25757C0A966958260 |title=Ex-Senator Ends Retirement And Faces an Election Issue |agency=Associated Press   |date=April 14, 1990 |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}</ref> and was treated with [[Prozac]]. He retired from the Senate in 1989 and intended to retire from politics entirely. However, several supporters convinced him to enter the 1990 Florida Governor's race against [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[Bob Martinez]]. During the Democratic Party primary, his opponent [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] attempted to make an issue of Chiles' age and health, a strategy that backfired badly in a state with a large population of retirees.\n\nChiles ran a campaign to \"reinvent\" the state's government, and defeated Martinez to take office in 1991. During his first term as governor, Chiles managed to accomplish very little. Although he developed ambitious health-care and tax reform packages, neither passed in the hostile state legislature. The early years of his term were troubled by a national economic recession that severely damaged Florida's tourism-based economy, and by [[Hurricane Andrew]], which struck near [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] in August, 1992.\n\nChiles ran for re-election in 1994 against [[Jeb Bush]]. He defeated Bush by a narrow 64,000 vote margin with 50.75% of the popular vote. As of 2017, his victory remains the last by a Democratic candidate in a Florida gubernatorial election. Republican candidate Bush ran a television advertisement which featured the mother of a teenage girl who had been abducted and murdered many years before. The mother stated that \"Her killer is still on death row, and we're still waiting for justice. We won't get it from Lawton Chiles because he's too liberal on crime\", referring to Chiles not signing the convicted killer's death warrant. Chiles, then governor, responded that he did not sign a death warrant because the case was still on appeal. The Democratic governor further claimed a record of support for the death penalty, having presided over 18 executions during his two terms (among them the first Floridian woman executed since 1848). Moreover, after the botched electrocution of [[Pedro Medina]] in 1997, and despite significant public criticism, Chiles refused to endorse the use of [[lethal injection]] as a lawful form of execution.  The new method was introduced under Bush's administration in 1999 after the execution of [[Allen Lee Davis]].\n\nChiles' second term as governor was notable as the first time in state history that a Democratic governor had a legislature controlled by the Republican Party. Despite this, he had some successes, including a successful lawsuit he and state [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] filed against the [[tobacco industry]], which resulted in an $11.3&nbsp;billion settlement for the state. He also won approval for a $2.7&nbsp;billion statewide school construction program. In 1995 Chiles sought treatment for a neurological problem, after he awoke with nausea, slurred speech and loss of coordination. He recovered fully.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rhea Chiles embracing her son Bud Chiles during the funeral of Lawton Chiles.jpg|thumb|[[Rhea Chiles]] embracing her son Bud during the funeral of Lawton Chiles, on December 15, 1998.]]\n\nIneligible to run a third time, Chiles supported the [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida|lieutenant governor]], his personal friend [[Buddy MacKay]], in the [[1998 Florida gubernatorial election|1998 Florida governor's race]] against [[Jeb Bush]]. Bush, however, scored an easy victory over MacKay. On December 12 that year, just three weeks before his long-awaited retirement was to begin, Chiles suffered a fatal heart attack while exercising on a cycling machine in the Governor's Mansion gymnasium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lawton Chiles 1930-1998|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=December 13, 1998|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-12-13-9812130101-story.html}}</ref>\n\nFuneral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], on December 16, 1998 following a funeral procession that traced part of his walk from the 1970 Senate campaign, from the panhandle town of [[Century, Florida|Century]] to Tallahassee.

He emphasized health coverage for the uninsured and led a campaign to create the National Commission for Prevention of Infant Mortality in the late 1980s. In 1994 he fought for the creation of regional health care alliances throughout the state, which allow small businesses to pool their health care dollars and broaden coverage while saving money. He also created the Florida Department of Elder Affairs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zHnlBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=florida+department+of+elder+affairs+lawton+chiles#v=onepage&q=florida%20department%20of%20elder%20affairs%20lawton%20chiles&f=false|title=Florida Governors: Lasting Legacies|last=Buccellato|first=Robert|date=2015-02-02|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439649534|location=|pages=112|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Chiles created the Florida Healthy Start program to provide a comprehensive prenatal and infant care program available to all pregnant women and infants across the state; since the program's inception the state's [[infant mortality]] rate has dropped 18%. In 1996, Chiles appointed a Governor's Commission on Education to examine the state's school system. One of the significant recommendations that came from that commission eventually led to the highly controversial 2002 [[Florida Constitution|state constitutional]] amendment restricting Florida's school class sizes.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 1997, [[anti-abortion]] [[advocacy group]] ''[[Choose Life (organization)|Choose Life]]'' collected 10,000 signatures and filed the $30,000 fee required under Florida law at the time to submit an application for a new specialty plate. State Senator [[Tom Lee (politician)|Tom Lee]] sponsored a bill in support of the tag's creation.

Chiles appointed Justice [[Major B. Harding]] in 1991, Justice [[Charles T. Wells]] in 1994, Justice [[Harry Lee Anstead]] in 1994, Justice [[Barbara J. Pariente]] in 1997, and Justice [[R. Fred Lewis]] in 1998.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Chiles and incoming Gov. Jeb Bush jointly appointed Justice [[Peggy A. Quince]] in 1998 just a few days before Chiles' death. Quince was jointly appointed because her term as Justice would begin the exact moment that Bush's first term as governor began, so there was a legal question which governor had the authority to appoint her. Bush and Chiles agreed to make a joint appointment to avoid a lawsuit over the question.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridasupremecourt.org/News-Media/Court-News/Justice-Quince-Appointed-20-Years-Ago|title=Justice Quince Appointed 20 Years Ago|website=Supreme Court|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThus, at one point, Chiles had appointed five of the seven Justices and had jointly appointed the sixth. Chiles' appointments formed the Supreme Court majorities that decided the following major cases:\n* In 2006, the Court struck down a law passed by the [[Florida State Legislature]] that had created the United States' first statewide [[education voucher]] program. The majority in this case consisted of Wells, Anstead, Pariente, Lewis, and Quince. Bush appointees [[Raoul G. Cantero]] and [[Kenneth B.

Birmingham}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n'''James Hannay''' [[FRSE]] (17 February 1827 \u2013 9 January 1873), was a [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]], journalist and diplomat.\n\n==Early life==\nHannay was born at [[Dumfries]], Scotland, on 17 February 1827. His father, David Hannay (1794\u20131864), a member of the Speculative Society at [[Edinburgh University]], 1813\u201314, and author of ''Ned Allen, or the Past Age,'' 1849, was engaged in business in Dumfries. The family had some reason for believing that they were descended from the Hannays of Sorble. In James Hannay, the belief was sufficiently strong to influence his studies, inclining him to study heraldry and family history.{{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\n==Naval career==\nHannay entered the [[Royal Navy]] on 2 March 1840, on board {{HMS|Cambridge|1815|6}}, and served in her during the blockade of [[Alexandria]] in the Syrian war, and had therefore no share in the operations of Sir [[Charles Elers Napier|Charles Napier]]'s squadron at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. From ''Cambridge'' he passed in succession to the sloop {{HMS|Snake|1832|6}} in 1842, the corvette {{HMS|Orestes|1824|6}} in 1843, and {{HMS|Formidable|1825|6}} in 1844. His tastes and his impatience both of routine work and control unfitted him for the life of a naval officer. Very soon after entering the service, he began to devote himself to general reading, and even studied [[Latin]] with a priest at [[Malta]]. With the instinct of a born journalist, he started a manuscript comic paper to ridicule the admiral and captains on the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Station]]. At a later period, he was wont to confess that he had been a somewhat insubordinate [[midshipman]].\n\nIn 1845, Hannay and two brother-officers were tried by [[court-martial]] and dismissed the service. The finding of the court was generally thought to have been vindictive, and it was subsequently quashed on the ground of informality. Hannay was not, however, employed again, nor did he seriously seek for employment.{{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\n==Journalist==\nFrom 1846 onwards till his appointment as consul in 1868, Hannay worked on the press and at literature. His first engagement was as a reporter on the ''Morning Chronicle,'' in which capacity he relied more on his remarkable memory than on his knowledge of shorthand. In the meantime, he was reading zealously in the [[British Museum]]. At the end of 1847, he worked with [[Henry Sutherland Edwards]] on ''Pasquin,'' a very short-lived comic paper, and the forerunner of the somewhat happier ''Puppet Show,'' which lasted from 1848 to 1849.\n\nIn 1848, he began using his naval experiences, and wrote the first of the stories which were afterwards collected in his ''Sketches in Ultramarine,'' published in 1853. \nIn 1848, he first made the acquaintance of [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] and Carlyle, to whom he was proud to acknowledge his obligations. He soon improved his literary connection, and worked for papers of good position, for the quarterlies and magazines, till he became editor of the ''Edinburgh Evening Courant'' in 1860.{{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\nDuring these years he published his best work, his two naval novels, ''Singleton Fontenoy'' (1850) and ''Eustace Conyers'' (1855), and the volume of lectures on ''Satire and Satirist,'' delivered at the Literary Institution, Edward Street, Portman Square, in 1853, and collected in book form in 1854. It was during these years also that he began to write the essays to the ''Quarterly,'' afterwards collected into a volume, and that he taught himself to read Greek.\n\nIn 1857, he contested without success the representation of the Dumfries boroughs in parliament. He stood as a tory, and was defeated by [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]]. From 1860 to 1864, he edited the ''[[Edinburgh Courant|Edinburgh Evening Courant]].'' \nThe zeal with which he attacked conduct and persons he disliked caused his management of the paper to be somewhat conspicuous. {{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\nIn 1863 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposer being [[William Edmonstoune Aytoun]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Consul==\nIn 1864, he returned to London, and remained there till he was appointed [[Consul (representative)|consul]] at Brest by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], in 1868. During these years, he published his ''Studies on Thackeray'' (1869), his ''Three Hundred Years of a Norman House'' (1866), a portion of a history of the Gurney family, and his ''Course of English Literature'' (1866), a reprint of articles contributed years before to the ''Welcome Guest.'' Hannay did not proceed to Brest, but exchanged this post for that of Barcelona in Spain. Although he continued to write for papers and magazines, chiefly for the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' and the ''Cornhill,'' he published no more books. {{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\n==Death==\nHannay's death occurred very suddenly on 9 January 1873 at [[Putchet]], a suburb of Barcelona. {{sfn|Hannay|1890}}\n\n==Family==\nHannay was twice married, first, in 1853, to Margaret Thompson, who died in 1865; and then, in 1868, to Jean Hannay, a lady of the same name, but of no traceable relationship, who died in Spain in 1870.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

A combined CD/DVD double-album was released in October 2004 as a joint release between Alternative Tentacles and Smooch Records.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

Its main route, approximately {{convert|740|km|mi|sp=us}} long, connected the capital, [[Berlin]], with the cities of [[Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland) and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). At [[Eydtkuhnen]] (now [[Chernyshevskoye]], Russia) it reached the [[German Empire]]'s border with the [[Russian Empire]]. The first part of the line opened in 1851, reaching Eydtkuhnen in 1860. By March 1880 the total route length reached {{convert|2210|km|mi|sp=us}}, with a main parallel route in the south via [[Bromberg]] (now [[Bydgoszcz]], Poland) and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] (now [[Toru\u0144]], Poland) to [[Insterburg]] (now [[Chernyakhovsk]], Russia). The lines were the first part of the later [[Prussian State Railways]] ({{lang-de|Preu\u00dfische Staatseisenbahnen}}).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm IV von preussen 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]]]\nFrom about 1840, the Prussian military urgently sought a railway connection to the Russian border for strategic reasons. The railway was also seen from the early years as a means of developing the underdeveloped areas of [[East Prussia]] and [[Pomerania]]. A lack of interest from the private sector led King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] to initiate in 1845 preparatory work for the construction of the Eastern Railway. Construction was stopped, as the members of the provincial [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] (''Provinziallandtag'') of East Prussia refused consent for the king to borrow for the project. This vote was confirmed in the United Diet (''Vereinigter Landtag''), the first parliamentary body covering all of Prussia, which was convened in April 1847 and subsequently dissolved. Members voted by a two-thirds majority against authorising a government loan for the Eastern Railway project.\n\nOnly the events of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution of 1848]] and the appointment of the banker, [[August von der Heydt]] as the Prussian Minister of Commerce and Industry\u2014and therefore responsible for railways\u2014led to progress on the issue. In August 1849, Von der Heydt laid before the diet a draft law for the construction of the Eastern Railway, which was adopted on 7 December 1849.\n\nPreviously, on 5 November 1849, the [[Railway divisions in Germany|Railway division]] of the Eastern Railway (''K\u00f6nigliche Direktion der Ostbahn'') had been established in Bromberg. Minister von der Heydt then initiated the restart of the construction of the Eastern Railway with funds from the \"Railway Fund\".\n\n===Construction of the main line ===\n[[File:Karte_ostbahn-A.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Main routes of the Prussian Eastern Railway marked on map of 1905]]\nIn 1848, construction had already been completed of the main line of the private [[Stargard-Posen Railway Company]] (''Stargard-Posener Eisenbahn''), between [[Stargard Szczeci\u0144ski|Stargard]] and Posen ([[Pozna\u0144]]). This line is now part of the [[Pozna\u0144 G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Pozna\u0144]]\u2013[[Szczecin G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Szczecin]] railway. In the middle of the line near the village of Lukatz, a railway station was created at a junction of a line to Kustrin ([[Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105]]). From this same station, the first 145&nbsp;km long section of the Eastern Railway was built via Schneidem\u00fchl ([[Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station|Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna]]) to Bromberg; this was opened on 27 July 1851. The station near Lukatz was later called ''Kreuz'' (cross), which, from 1936, was the official name of the town. It became an important railway junction. It is now called [[Krzy\u017c Wielkopolski]] in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The continuation of the first section via Dirschau ([[Tczew]]) to Danzig (161&nbsp;km) was completed on 6 August 1852. During this time, trains between Kreuz and Berlin ran via the [[Berlin\u2013Szczecin railway|Berlin-Stettin railway]] and the Stargard\u2013Posen line.\n\nBeyond the [[Nogat]] and [[Vistula]] rivers, the railway continued to be built from Marienburg ([[Malbork]]) via Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]) to Braunsberg ([[Braniewo]]) (83.75&nbsp;km); it was opened on 19 October 1852. It was extended to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (62&nbsp;km) on 2 August 1853. After the completion of the railway bridges over the Vistula in September 1857 and over the Nogat on 12 October 1857, the 18&nbsp;km long Dirschau ([[Tczew]])\u2013Malbork line was completed. At the same time, the 29&nbsp;km long [[K\u00fcstrin-Kietz\u2013Frankfurt (Oder) railway|direct line]] from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] via [[Lebus]] to K\u00fcstrin as well as the 105&nbsp;km line from K\u00fcstrin via Landsberg an der Warthe ([[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]]) to Kreuz was opened. Berlin was therefore reached by a shorter route via the [[Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische Railway]] (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', NME). The [[Prussian state railways]] acquired a stake in the NME and took over its management in 1850 and purchased the remaining shares of the railway in 1852. \n\t\nIn 1853, [[Edward Wiebe]] was the Director of the Railway division of the Eastern Railway in Bromberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116708 |title=Wiebe |work= Meyers Konversationslexikon |date=1885\u20131892|language=German|accessdate=17 December 2011 }}</ref> Already in the 1840s, he had been involved in planning the line and since 1849 he had been in the technical management of the Railway division of the Eastern Railway. One of his successors was [[Albert von Maybach]] (1863\u20131867), previously Chairman of the Board of the [[Upper Silesian Railway]] (''Oberschlesische Eisenbahn'').\n\nOn 1 October 1866, an 18&nbsp;km of the line was opened towards Berlin from K\u00fcstrin to Gusow and, on 1 October 1867, the last 64&nbsp;km section of the direct line between Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg was opened from Gusow to [[Berlin Old Ostbahnhof|Berlin East station]] (''Berlin Ostbahnhof'') via [[Strausberg station|Strausberg]].\n\nThe line was extended from K\u00f6nigsberg on 6 June 1860 to Insterburg (Polish: [[Chernyakhovsk|Wystru\u0107]], [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a) via Gumbinnen (Polish: [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|G\u0105bin]], Russian: \u0413\u0443\u0301\u0441\u0435\u0432), Trakehnen (Polish: [[Yasnaya Polyana|Jasna Polana]], Russian: \u042f\u0301\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0301\u043d\u0430) and Stalluponen ([[Nesterov]], Russian: \u041d\u0435\u0301\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432) and extended to Eydtkuhnen ([[Chernyshevskoye]], Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435) on the Russian frontier on 15 August 1860, a total distance of 153&nbsp;km. Transhipments and transfers took place at the station over the border then called Virbalis in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (German: Wirballen, Russian: Verzhbolovo, \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e, Polish: Wierzba\u0142owo), now called [[Kybartai]]. Later the gauge-conversion of carriages on through trains to the [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]] tracks of the Russian Railways was carried out there. In 1871, the 34&nbsp;km shorter Schneidem\u00fchl\u2013Konitz\u2013Dirschau (now Tczew) line was built parallel, bypassing Bromberg. After the completion of these sections work began with duplicating the line from K\u00fcstrin east. The route from Berlin to Kustrin however, was already duplicated. In addition, there were several sections of line built parallel with the main line over short sections.\n\nIn 1882, the [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Silesian station]] (''Schlesischer Bahnhof'') was opened as the new terminus for the line in Berlin and the old East Station was closed.\n\n===Importance to Prussia ===\nOnce completed to the east, the Eastern Railway line opened up the Prussian provinces from Berlin. Freight traffic exceeded projections by several times. This was mostly made up of agricultural products such as livestock, grain and vegetables. The disruption of river traffic by the frequent low water levels in the [[Oder]], Vistula and [[Warta]] rivers or their freezing in the winter months led to periodic spikes in freight traffic on the Eastern Railway.\n\nThe Eastern Railway itself was also a significant economic factor. Its construction during an economic crisis created jobs on a large scale. At the height of its construction in June 1851, 12,000 workers were employed on building its track. The Royal Railway division of the Eastern Railway in Bromberg ([[Bydgoszcz]]) established ten operating offices in Berlin, Schneidem\u00fchl ([[Pi\u0142a]]), Stolp ([[S\u0142upsk]]), Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]), [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]), Thorn ([[Toru\u0144]]), Bromberg ([[Bydgoszcz]]), Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) and Posen ([[Pozna\u0144]]). In 1880, its rolling stock included 265 passenger and express locomotives, 320 freight locomotives and 93 [[tank locomotive]]s.\n\nA local railway industry was established to supply the Eastern Railway. In 1855, the ''Union-Gie\u00dferei'' (foundry) K\u00f6nigsberg began to build locomotives; the [[Schichau-Werke]] (works) of [[Ferdinand Schichau]] of Elbing followed its example in 1860. The K\u00f6nigsberg agricultural equipment manufacturer L. Steinfurt built freight wagons and passenger carriages.\n\nFurther independent railway divisions were created in Bromberg, Danzig, K\u00f6nigsberg and Posen under the reorganisation of the Prussian state railways in 1895.\n\nThe Eastern Railway was at the time one of the major long-distance rail routes in Europe and one of the main axes for east-west traffic. Several international trains ran on it, including the legendary luxury train, the [[Nord Express]], the latter in the \"golden age\" before the First World War.\n\nThe development of the main railways and branch lines extended the network to 4,833 route kilometers in 1895.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Ostbahn,+kgl.+preu%C3%9Fische |author= R\u00f6ll, Freiherr von |title= Enzyklop\u00e4die des Eisenbahnwesens 1912\u20131923 |language=German|accessdate=17 December 2011 }}</ref> At this time Berlin was served by seven daily long-distance freight trains from eastern Germany and, in long-distance passenger traffic, fifteen trains ran daily to East Prussia. Since 1892, \u201cD-trains\u201d ([[Schnellzug|D-Z\u00fcge]]: long-distance expresses) also ran on the Eastern Railway.\n\n===Reichsbahn era ===\nAfter the First World War the Prussian state railways, including the Eastern Railway, along with the other German state railways were incorporated into the newly created [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]]. Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the [[Polish Corridor]] was created in 1919, separating the [[Free City of Danzig]] and [[East Prussia]] from [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], leaving East Prussia as an [[exclave]]. The Eastern Railway line became a major transit link between East Prussia and the rest of Germany. This caused a bottleneck at the bridge over the Vistula to the south of Danzig near Dirschau, now [[Tczew]] under [[Second Polish Republic|Polish control]]. Conflicts over the use of the railway during the [[interwar period]] were declared by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the [[causes of World War II]].\n\nBy contrast, the over 1,000 metre-long<ref>{{Brueckenweb | id = 43535|title= Weichselbr\u00fccke M\u00fcnsterwalde |accessdate= 17 December 2011}}</ref> steel bridge built between 1905 and 1909 over the [[Vistula]] near M\u00fcnsterwalde (Polish: Most w Opaleniu) was dismantled from 1927 to 1929, because the Poles had no use for a bridge to the East Prussian city of Marienwerder ([[Kwidzyn]]).\n\nIn the summer 1939 timetable four pairs of express trains, twelve D-trains and a pair of long-distance transit trains between Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg operated on the line. The latter required a travel time of 6 hours and 36 minutes for the 590 kilometre long line from K\u00f6nigsberg to Berlin Silesian station.\n\nThe railway network of the former East Prussian province in 1937 had a length of 4,176 kilometers. On 22 January 1945, the last train ran from K\u00f6nigsberg to Berlin; after that no continuous rail traffic ran on this line.\n\n==Current situation ==\nSince 1991 the term ''Ostbahn'' (Eastern Railway) has again been used to appeal to the nostalgia of tourists wishing to travel along parts of the former line.\n\n[[Oder\u2013Neisse line|Substantial boundary changes]] were made as a result of the German defeat in World War II, so that the only part of the former Eastern Railway to remain in Germany is the section from Berlin to the Oder River near K\u00fcstrin. This, along with the sections now located on Polish or Russian territory, is mostly operated as a single-track branch line. Some formerly important international stations, such as Eydtkuhnen, no longer exist or have only a very minor role. The only international long-distance train on the Eastern Railway in recent years was the D-448/449 night train (''Stanislaw Moniuszko''), linking [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Berlin-Lichtenberg]] and [[Warsaw]], which ran on the line as far as [[Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station|Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna]] until 2009. Additionally, through carriages ran on the line to [[Gdynia]], Kaliningrad and [[Krakow]].\n\n===Germany ===\nThe section within the current borders of Germany that connects Berlin with the Polish border near K\u00fcstrin-Kietz is now a largely single-track non-electrified main line, part of the tariff zone of the [[Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg]] (Berlin-Brandenburg Transport Association) and has been operated by [[Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn]] since 10 December 2006 with [[Bombardier Talent]] diesel multiple units. On 22 December 2006, the line speed was restored to 120&nbsp;km/h between the 75.0 and 80.7 kilometre points for the first time in 60 years. This did not affect travel times or the timetable, but the change is considered a sign of an incipient upgrade of the Eastern Railway.\n\n===Poland ===\nThe line in Poland from Kostrzyn to Pi\u0142a is double track except for a short section at the eastern exit of Gorz\u00f3w station. The line is single track from Pi\u0142a to [[Gutowiec]]. The line is now duplicated again from Gutowiec to [[Bogaczewo, Elbl\u0105g County|Bogaczewo]]. It is single track from Bogaczewo to the national border with Russia in Braniewo. From Elbl\u0105g to Kaliningrad, a Russian broad gauge track was laid next to the standard gauge track; this has been dismantled between Elbl\u0105g and Bogaczewo. This track is still present in M\u0142ynary, but unused. Between Chrusciel and Braniewo the ballast is missing and it is not usable. From Tczew to Bogaczewo the line is operated with electric trains. As the line passes through a sparsely populated area, far from urban areas, the Eastern Railway here only carries minor traffic.\n\n===Russia ===\n{{See also|Kaliningrad Railway}}\nThe short section of line from Kaliningrad to Kybartai in Lithuania is the only part of the former Eastern Railway that still has an important function, as it is the transit route from Kaliningrad to the Russian heartland. It belongs to the [[Kaliningrad Railway]] and has been rebuilt to [[Russian gauge]]. The station with controls at the Lithuanian border is now Nesterov, since the former border station at Chernyshevskoye was completely dismantled after Lithuania was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and border controls were abolished. Russian Railways now plans to rebuild the border station at Chernyshevskoye because Nesterov station does not provide sufficient capacity. The section from [[Mamonovo]] (''Heiligenbeil'') until shortly before Kaliningrad has a main track in Russian broad gauge and formerly had a standard gauge track. While the broad gauge track follows the traditional route from the west to Kaliningrad South Station (formerly ''K\u00f6nigsberg Hauptbahnhof''), the other track diverted south around the city and reached the station from the east.\n\n== Branch and spur railway lines ==\n\nAn important branch of the line was the 290&nbsp;km long [[Toru\u0144\u2013Chernyakhovsk railway|line]] between Thorn and Insterburg (Russian: [[Chernyakhovsk]], \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a) created in 1871\u20131873 after Thorn was connected with Bromberg in 1861.\n\nFounded in 1846, the Stargard-Posen Railway Company (''Stargard-Posener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', SPE) built a 170&nbsp;km-long single-track main line, which connected the two provincial capitals of Stettin and Posen. The route crossed the main line of the Eastern Railway at Kreuz station. Because the company's revenue in the early days did not meet expectations, the government took over the SPE in 1851 and placed it in the Royal Railway Division of the Eastern Railroad in Bromberg, then in 1857 it was also temporarily managed by the state-owned [[Upper Silesian Railway]] (''Oberschlesischen Eisenbahn''). It was formally nationalised on 1 January 1883, although the company name was still used in July 1886.\nOther important lines of the Eastern Railroad were:\n\n* [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] \u2013 Neufahrwasser (1867)\n* [[Fredersdorf-Vogelsdorf|Fredersdorf]] \u2013 [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] (1872)\n* [[Szczecinek|Neustettin]] \u2013 [[W\u0119gorzyno|Wangerin]] (1877, Pommersche Centralbahn)\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Chojnice|Konitz]] (1878, Pommersche Centralbahn; now the [[Chojnice - Runowo Pomorskie line]])\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Bia\u0142ogard|Belgard]] (1878)\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Korzybie (PKP station)|Zollbr\u00fcck (Pommern)]] \u2013 [[Dar\u0142owo|R\u00fcgenwalde]]/[[Ustka|Stolpm\u00fcnde]] (1878)\n* [[Pi\u0142a|Schneidem\u00fchl]] \u2013 [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (1879)\n* Schneidem\u00fchl \u2013 Neustettin (1879)\n* [[Jelcz-Laskowice|Laskowitz]] \u2013 [[Grudzi\u0105dz|Graudenz]] \u2013 [[Jab\u0142onowo Pomorskie|Jablonowo]] (connecting the railways [[Bydgoszcz|Bromberg]] \u2013 K\u00f6nigsberg and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] \u2013 [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], 1879/78)\n* [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]] \u2013 [[Go\u0142dap|Goldap]] \u2013 [[E\u0142k|Lyck]] (1878/79)\n\n== Berlin suburban line==\n\nWhile the traffic to the east was limited mostly to long-distance services, upgrading of the line began in Berlin. First, the tracks of the [[Berlin Ringbahn]] (the circular railway, the eastern section of which opened in 1871), the [[Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische Railway]] (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'') from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and the Eastern Railway connected at a level junction near [[Ostkreuz|Stralau Rummelsburg station]]. From 1 May 1888, trains could run through the Silesian Station over the [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] to the centre of Berlin and the lines to its west. Shortly afterwards another pair of tracks was added to the northern half of the Ringbahn to allow suburban trains to run independently of long-distance traffic.\n\nThe interweaving of long-distance and suburban tracks at the junction of the Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische railway and the Eastern Railway led to increasing congestion. The location of the intersection with the Ringbahn had insufficient space, so a new grade-separated junction was built on the main line from Frankfurt (Oder) 2&nbsp;km away at [[Berlin-Betriebsbahnhof Rummelsburg station|Rummelsburg depot]]. From there a line ran to the northeast to connect with the main line just to the west of [[Kaulsdorf (Berlin)|Kaulsdorf]]. An additional platform was opened at [[Kaulsdorf station]] in 1901 for the traffic on this line, known as the [[VnK Railway|VnK line]]. \u201cVn\u201d may have stood for ''Verbindung nach'' (connection to) or ''von und nach'' (from and to) while K probably stood for Kaulsdorf or K\u00fcstrin. The old platform was left on the original line for suburban services to the Ringbahn. To the west of this was the link with the Stadtbahn suburban tracks. In 1903, a separate pair of suburban tracks was laid next to the Frankfurt (Oder) line between the intersection of the long-distance lines at Rummelsburg and the start of the Stadtbahn. This required a grade-separation of the Stadtbahn tracks with the link to the Silesian station.\n\nThe junction of the Ringbahn with the Stadtbahn and Stralau Rummelsburg station were entirely rebuilt in 1903. The two east\u2013west lines and the Ringbahn were each given a platform for suburban traffic. This development made Stralau-Rummelsburg station one of the biggest stations in Berlin. In 1933 its name was changed to [[Ostkreuz]].\n\nIn the mid-1920s, extensive electrification began on the Berlin suburban lines. Electrification of the Eastern Railway was completed on 6 November 1928. Operation of a mixture of steam and electric trains continued until January 1929. On 15 December 1930, the suburban services were designated as [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] services as far as [[Mahlsdorf railway station|Mahlsdorf station]]. The long-distance platform was removed at Kaulsdorf station.\n\nThe [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania plan]] of the [[Nazis]] envisioned a comprehensive upgrading of the line. The train was to be extended to Strausberg or [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] south of the line. Another pair of long-distance tracks would have been built as far as the Berlin city limits at Mahlsdorf. Since the Eastern Railway was a strategically important route on the basis of its orientation, work continued on this project despite the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1944, the predominantly suburban single-track line to Strausberg was put into operation, but services continued to be operated with steam trains. Electrical operations commenced in 1947-1948 in four stages. The S-Bahn route was later extended on a newly built branch line to [[Strausberg Nord station|Strausberg Nord]].\n\nIn 1989, the [[U5 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn line E]] (now U 5) was extended over the VnK line to [[Berlin Wuhletal station|Wuhletal station]]. It is the only station in Berlin where it is possible to transfer between S-Bahn and U-Bahn services on the same platform. In 1992, [[Birkenstein station]] was opened between Mahlsdorf and [[Hoppegarten (Mark) station|Hoppegarten]]. At the same time a second S-Bahn track went into operation on this section.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n*[[History of rail transport in Germany]]\n*[[History of rail transport in Poland]]\n\n== Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References==\n* {{cite journal| author= Kurt Born |title= Die Entwicklung der k\u00f6niglich preu\u00dfischen Ostbahn. |journal= Archiv f\u00fcr Eisenbahnwesen |volume= 34 |year= 1911 |issue= 4/5/6 |pages= 879\u2013939; 1125\u20131172; 1431\u20131461 |language=German |postscript=&nbsp;(also separate publication: Springer, Berlin 1911)}}\n* {{cite book| author= Andreas Gei\u00dfler, Konrad Koschinski |title=130&nbsp;Jahre Ostbahn Berlin \u2013 K\u00f6nigsberg \u2013 Baltikum. | editor= Deutschen Bahnkunden-Verband e.&nbsp;V. |publisher= GVE |location= Berlin |year= 1997 | ISBN= 3-89218-048-2 |language=German }}\n* {{cite journal| author=Johannes Gl\u00f6ckner |title= Abgetrennt.

Its main route, approximately {{convert|740|km|mi|sp=us}} long, connected the capital, [[Berlin]], with the cities of [[Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland) and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). At [[Eydtkuhnen]] (now [[Chernyshevskoye]], Russia) it reached the [[German Empire]]'s border with the [[Russian Empire]]. The first part of the line opened in 1851, reaching Eydtkuhnen in 1860. By March 1880 the total route length reached {{convert|2210|km|mi|sp=us}}, with a main parallel route in the south via [[Bromberg]] (now [[Bydgoszcz]], Poland) and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] (now [[Toru\u0144]], Poland) to [[Insterburg]] (now [[Chernyakhovsk]], Russia). The lines were the first part of the later [[Prussian State Railways]] ({{lang-de|Preu\u00dfische Staatseisenbahnen}}).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm IV von preussen 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]]]\nFrom about 1840, the Prussian military urgently sought a railway connection to the Russian border for strategic reasons. The railway was also seen from the early years as a means of developing the underdeveloped areas of [[East Prussia]] and [[Pomerania]]. A lack of interest from the private sector led King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] to initiate in 1845 preparatory work for the construction of the Eastern Railway. Construction was stopped, as the members of the provincial [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] (''Provinziallandtag'') of East Prussia refused consent for the king to borrow for the project. This vote was confirmed in the United Diet (''Vereinigter Landtag''), the first parliamentary body covering all of Prussia, which was convened in April 1847 and subsequently dissolved. Members voted by a two-thirds majority against authorising a government loan for the Eastern Railway project.\n\nOnly the events of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution of 1848]] and the appointment of the banker, [[August von der Heydt]] as the Prussian Minister of Commerce and Industry\u2014and therefore responsible for railways\u2014led to progress on the issue. In August 1849, Von der Heydt laid before the diet a draft law for the construction of the Eastern Railway, which was adopted on 7 December 1849.\n\nPreviously, on 5 November 1849, the [[Railway divisions in Germany|Railway division]] of the Eastern Railway (''K\u00f6nigliche Direktion der Ostbahn'') had been established in Bromberg. Minister von der Heydt then initiated the restart of the construction of the Eastern Railway with funds from the \"Railway Fund\".\n\n===Construction of the main line ===\n[[File:Karte_ostbahn-A.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Main routes of the Prussian Eastern Railway marked on map of 1905]]\nIn 1848, construction had already been completed of the main line of the private [[Stargard-Posen Railway Company]] (''Stargard-Posener Eisenbahn''), between [[Stargard Szczeci\u0144ski|Stargard]] and Posen ([[Pozna\u0144]]). This line is now part of the [[Pozna\u0144 G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Pozna\u0144]]\u2013[[Szczecin G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Szczecin]] railway. In the middle of the line near the village of Lukatz, a railway station was created at a junction of a line to Kustrin ([[Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105]]). From this same station, the first 145&nbsp;km long section of the Eastern Railway was built via Schneidem\u00fchl ([[Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station|Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna]]) to Bromberg; this was opened on 27 July 1851. The station near Lukatz was later called ''Kreuz'' (cross), which, from 1936, was the official name of the town. It became an important railway junction. It is now called [[Krzy\u017c Wielkopolski]] in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The continuation of the first section via Dirschau ([[Tczew]]) to Danzig (161&nbsp;km) was completed on 6 August 1852. During this time, trains between Kreuz and Berlin ran via the [[Berlin\u2013Szczecin railway|Berlin-Stettin railway]] and the Stargard\u2013Posen line.\n\nBeyond the [[Nogat]] and [[Vistula]] rivers, the railway continued to be built from Marienburg ([[Malbork]]) via Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]) to Braunsberg ([[Braniewo]]) (83.75&nbsp;km); it was opened on 19 October 1852. It was extended to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (62&nbsp;km) on 2 August 1853. After the completion of the railway bridges over the Vistula in September 1857 and over the Nogat on 12 October 1857, the 18&nbsp;km long Dirschau ([[Tczew]])\u2013Malbork line was completed. At the same time, the 29&nbsp;km long [[K\u00fcstrin-Kietz\u2013Frankfurt (Oder) railway|direct line]] from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] via [[Lebus]] to K\u00fcstrin as well as the 105&nbsp;km line from K\u00fcstrin via Landsberg an der Warthe ([[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]]) to Kreuz was opened. Berlin was therefore reached by a shorter route via the [[Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische Railway]] (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', NME). The [[Prussian state railways]] acquired a stake in the NME and took over its management in 1850 and purchased the remaining shares of the railway in 1852. \n\t\nIn 1853, [[Edward Wiebe]] was the Director of the Railway division of the Eastern Railway in Bromberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116708 |title=Wiebe |work= Meyers Konversationslexikon |date=1885\u20131892|language=German|accessdate=17 December 2011 }}</ref> Already in the 1840s, he had been involved in planning the line and since 1849 he had been in the technical management of the Railway division of the Eastern Railway. One of his successors was [[Albert von Maybach]] (1863\u20131867), previously Chairman of the Board of the [[Upper Silesian Railway]] (''Oberschlesische Eisenbahn'').\n\nOn 1 October 1866, an 18&nbsp;km of the line was opened towards Berlin from K\u00fcstrin to Gusow and, on 1 October 1867, the last 64&nbsp;km section of the direct line between Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg was opened from Gusow to [[Berlin Old Ostbahnhof|Berlin East station]] (''Berlin Ostbahnhof'') via [[Strausberg station|Strausberg]].\n\nThe line was extended from K\u00f6nigsberg on 6 June 1860 to Insterburg (Polish: [[Chernyakhovsk|Wystru\u0107]], [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a) via Gumbinnen (Polish: [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|G\u0105bin]], Russian: \u0413\u0443\u0301\u0441\u0435\u0432), Trakehnen (Polish: [[Yasnaya Polyana|Jasna Polana]], Russian: \u042f\u0301\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0301\u043d\u0430) and Stalluponen ([[Nesterov]], Russian: \u041d\u0435\u0301\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432) and extended to Eydtkuhnen ([[Chernyshevskoye]], Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435) on the Russian frontier on 15 August 1860, a total distance of 153&nbsp;km. Transhipments and transfers took place at the station over the border then called Virbalis in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (German: Wirballen, Russian: Verzhbolovo, \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e, Polish: Wierzba\u0142owo), now called [[Kybartai]]. Later the gauge-conversion of carriages on through trains to the [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]] tracks of the Russian Railways was carried out there. In 1871, the 34&nbsp;km shorter Schneidem\u00fchl\u2013Konitz\u2013Dirschau (now Tczew) line was built parallel, bypassing Bromberg. After the completion of these sections work began with duplicating the line from K\u00fcstrin east. The route from Berlin to Kustrin however, was already duplicated. In addition, there were several sections of line built parallel with the main line over short sections.\n\nIn 1882, the [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Silesian station]] (''Schlesischer Bahnhof'') was opened as the new terminus for the line in Berlin and the old East Station was closed.\n\n===Importance to Prussia ===\nOnce completed to the east, the Eastern Railway line opened up the Prussian provinces from Berlin. Freight traffic exceeded projections by several times. This was mostly made up of agricultural products such as livestock, grain and vegetables. The disruption of river traffic by the frequent low water levels in the [[Oder]], Vistula and [[Warta]] rivers or their freezing in the winter months led to periodic spikes in freight traffic on the Eastern Railway.\n\nThe Eastern Railway itself was also a significant economic factor. Its construction during an economic crisis created jobs on a large scale. At the height of its construction in June 1851, 12,000 workers were employed on building its track. The Royal Railway division of the Eastern Railway in Bromberg ([[Bydgoszcz]]) established ten operating offices in Berlin, Schneidem\u00fchl ([[Pi\u0142a]]), Stolp ([[S\u0142upsk]]), Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]), [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]), Thorn ([[Toru\u0144]]), Bromberg ([[Bydgoszcz]]), Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) and Posen ([[Pozna\u0144]]). In 1880, its rollingstock included 265 passenger and express locomotives, 320 freight locomotives and 93 [[tank locomotive]]s.\n\nA local railway industry was established to supply the Eastern Railway. In 1855, the ''Union-Gie\u00dferei'' (foundry) K\u00f6nigsberg began to build locomotives, the [[Schichau-Werke]] (works) of [[Ferdinand Schichau]] of Elbing followed its example in 1860. The K\u00f6nigsberg agricultural equipment manufacturer, ''L. Steinfurt'' built freight wagons and passenger carriages.\n\nFurther independent railway divisions were created in Bromberg, Danzig, K\u00f6nigsberg and Posen under the reorganisation of the Prussian state railways in 1895.\n\nThe Eastern Railway was at the time one of the major long-distance rail routes in Europe and one of the main axes for east-west traffic. Several international trains ran on it, including the legendary luxury train, the [[Nord Express]], the latter in the \"golden age\" before the First World War.\n\nThe development of the main railways and branch lines extended the network to 4,833 route kilometers in 1895.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Ostbahn,+kgl.+preu%C3%9Fische |author= R\u00f6ll, Freiherr von |title= Enzyklop\u00e4die des Eisenbahnwesens 1912\u20131923 |language=German|accessdate=17 December 2011 }}</ref> At this time Berlin was served by seven daily long-distance freight trains from eastern Germany and, in long-distance passenger traffic, fifteen trains ran daily to East Prussia. Since 1892, \u201cD-trains\u201d ([[Schnellzug|D-Z\u00fcge]]: long-distance expresses) also ran on the Eastern Railway.\n\n===Reichsbahn era ===\nAfter the First World War the Prussian state railways, including the Eastern Railway, along with the other German state railways were incorporated into the newly created [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]]. Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the [[Polish Corridor]] was created in 1919, separating the [[Free City of Danzig]] and [[East Prussia]] from [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], leaving East Prussia as an [[exclave]]. The Eastern Railway line became a major transit link between East Prussia and the rest of Germany. This caused a bottleneck at the bridge over the Vistula to the south of Danzig near Dirschau, now [[Tczew]] under [[Second Polish Republic|Polish control]]. Conflicts over the use of the railway during the [[interwar period]] were declared by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the [[causes of World War II]].\n\nBy contrast, the over 1,000 metre-long<ref>{{Brueckenweb | id = 43535|title= Weichselbr\u00fccke M\u00fcnsterwalde |accessdate= 17 December 2011}}</ref> steel bridge built between 1905 and 1909 over the [[Vistula]] near M\u00fcnsterwalde (Polish: Most w Opaleniu) was dismantled from 1927 to 1929, because the Poles had no use for a bridge to the East Prussian city of Marienwerder ([[Kwidzyn]]).\n\nIn the summer 1939 timetable four pairs of express trains, twelve D-trains and a pair of long-distance transit trains between Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg operated on the line. The latter required a travel time of 6 hours and 36 minutes for the 590 kilometre long line from K\u00f6nigsberg to Berlin Silesian station.\n\nThe railway network of the former East Prussian province in 1937 had a length of 4,176 kilometers. On 22 January 1945, the last train ran from K\u00f6nigsberg to Berlin; after that no continuous rail traffic ran on this line.\n\n==Current situation ==\nSince 1991 the term ''Ostbahn'' (Eastern Railway) has again been used to appeal to the nostalgia of tourists wishing to travel along parts of the former line.\n\n[[Oder\u2013Neisse line|Substantial boundary changes]] were made as a result of the German defeat in World War II, so that the only part of the former Eastern Railway to remain in Germany is the section from Berlin to the Oder River near K\u00fcstrin. This, along with the sections now located on Polish or Russian territory, is mostly operated as a single-track branch line. Some formerly important international stations, such as Eydtkuhnen, no longer exist or have only a very minor role. The only international long-distance train on the Eastern Railway in recent years was the D-448/449 night train (''Stanislaw Moniuszko''), linking [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Berlin-Lichtenberg]] and [[Warsaw]], which ran on the line as far as [[Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station|Pi\u0142a G\u0142\u00f3wna]] until 2009. Additionally, through carriages ran on the line to [[Gdynia]], Kaliningrad and [[Krakow]].\n\n===Germany ===\nThe section within the current borders of Germany that connects Berlin with the Polish border near K\u00fcstrin-Kietz is now a largely single-track non-electrified main line, part of the tariff zone of the [[Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg]] (Berlin-Brandenburg Transport Association) and has been operated by [[Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn]] since 10 December 2006 with [[Bombardier Talent]] diesel multiple units. On 22 December 2006, the line speed was restored to 120&nbsp;km/h between the 75.0 and 80.7 kilometre points for the first time in 60 years. This did not affect travel times or the timetable, but the change is considered a sign of an incipient upgrade of the Eastern Railway.\n\n===Poland ===\nThe line in Poland from Kostrzyn to Pi\u0142a is double track except for a short section at the eastern exit of Gorz\u00f3w station. The line is single track from Pi\u0142a to [[Gutowiec]]. The line is now duplicated again from Gutowiec to [[Bogaczewo, Elbl\u0105g County|Bogaczewo]]. It is single track from Bogaczewo to the national border with Russia in Braniewo. From Elbl\u0105g to Kaliningrad, a Russian broad gauge track was laid next to the standard gauge track; this has been dismantled between Elbl\u0105g and Bogaczewo. This track is still present in M\u0142ynary, but unused. Between Chrusciel and Braniewo the ballast is missing and it is not usable. From Tczew to Bogaczewo the line is operated with electric trains. As the line passes through a sparsely populated area, far from urban areas, the Eastern Railway here only carries minor traffic.\n\n===Russia ===\n{{See also|Kaliningrad Railway}}\nThe short section of line from Kaliningrad to Kybartai in Lithuania is the only part of the former Eastern Railway that still has an important function, as it is the transit route from Kaliningrad to the Russian heartland. It belongs to the [[Kaliningrad Railway]] and has been rebuilt to [[Russian gauge]]. The station with controls at the Lithuanian border is now Nesterov, since the former border station at Chernyshevskoye was completely dismantled after Lithuania was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and border controls were abolished. Russian Railways now plans to rebuild the border station at Chernyshevskoye because Nesterov station does not provide sufficient capacity. The section from [[Mamonovo]] (''Heiligenbeil'') until shortly before Kaliningrad has a main track in Russian broad gauge and formerly had a standard gauge track. While the broad gauge track follows the traditional route from the west to Kaliningrad South Station (formerly ''K\u00f6nigsberg Hauptbahnhof''), the other track diverted south around the city and reached the station from the east.\n\n== Branch and spur railway lines ==\n\nAn important branch of the line was the 290&nbsp;km long [[Toru\u0144\u2013Chernyakhovsk railway|line]] between Thorn and Insterburg (Russian: [[Chernyakhovsk]], \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a) created in 1871\u20131873 after Thorn was connected with Bromberg in 1861.\n\nFounded in 1846, the Stargard-Posen Railway Company (''Stargard-Posener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', SPE) built a 170&nbsp;km-long single-track main line, which connected the two provincial capitals of Stettin and Posen. The route crossed the main line of the Eastern Railway at Kreuz station. Because the company's revenue in the early days did not meet expectations, the government took over the SPE in 1851 and placed it in the Royal Railway Division of the Eastern Railroad in Bromberg, then in 1857 it was also temporarily managed by the state-owned [[Upper Silesian Railway]] (''Oberschlesischen Eisenbahn''). It was formally nationalised on 1 January 1883, although the company name was still used in July 1886.\nOther important lines of the Eastern Railroad were:\n\n* [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] \u2013 Neufahrwasser (1867)\n* [[Fredersdorf-Vogelsdorf|Fredersdorf]] \u2013 [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] (1872)\n* [[Szczecinek|Neustettin]] \u2013 [[W\u0119gorzyno|Wangerin]] (1877, Pommersche Centralbahn)\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Chojnice|Konitz]] (1878, Pommersche Centralbahn; now the [[Chojnice - Runowo Pomorskie line]])\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Bia\u0142ogard|Belgard]] (1878)\n* Neustettin \u2013 [[Korzybie (PKP station)|Zollbr\u00fcck (Pommern)]] \u2013 [[Dar\u0142owo|R\u00fcgenwalde]]/[[Ustka|Stolpm\u00fcnde]] (1878)\n* [[Pi\u0142a|Schneidem\u00fchl]] \u2013 [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (1879)\n* Schneidem\u00fchl \u2013 Neustettin (1879)\n* [[Jelcz-Laskowice|Laskowitz]] \u2013 [[Grudzi\u0105dz|Graudenz]] \u2013 [[Jab\u0142onowo Pomorskie|Jablonowo]] (connecting the railways [[Bydgoszcz|Bromberg]] \u2013 K\u00f6nigsberg and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] \u2013 [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], 1879/78)\n* [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]] \u2013 [[Go\u0142dap|Goldap]] \u2013 [[E\u0142k|Lyck]] (1878/79)\n\n== Berlin suburban line==\n\nWhile the traffic to the east was limited mostly to long-distance services, upgrading of the line began in Berlin. First, the tracks of the [[Berlin Ringbahn]] (the circular railway, the eastern section of which opened in 1871), the [[Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische Railway]] (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'') from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and the Eastern Railway connected at a level junction near [[Ostkreuz|Stralau Rummelsburg station]]. From 1 May 1888, trains could run through the Silesian Station over the [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] to the centre of Berlin and the lines to its west. Shortly afterwards another pair of tracks was added to the northern half of the Ringbahn to allow suburban trains to run independently of long-distance traffic.\n\nThe interweaving of long-distance and suburban tracks at the junction of the Lower Silesian-M\u00e4rkische railway and the Eastern Railway led to increasing congestion. The location of the intersection with the Ringbahn had insufficient space, so a new grade-separated junction was built on the main line from Frankfurt (Oder) 2&nbsp;km away at [[Berlin-Betriebsbahnhof Rummelsburg station|Rummelsburg depot]]. From there a line ran to the northeast to connect with the main line just to the west of [[Kaulsdorf (Berlin)|Kaulsdorf]]. An additional platform was opened at [[Kaulsdorf station]] in 1901 for the traffic on this line, known as the [[VnK Railway|VnK line]]. \u201cVn\u201d may have stood for ''Verbindung nach'' (connection to) or ''von und nach'' (from and to) while K probably stood for Kaulsdorf or K\u00fcstrin. The old platform was left on the original line for suburban services to the Ringbahn. To the west of this was the link with the Stadtbahn suburban tracks. In 1903, a separate pair of suburban tracks was laid next to the Frankfurt (Oder) line between the intersection of the long-distance lines at Rummelsburg and the start of the Stadtbahn. This required a grade-separation of the Stadtbahn tracks with the link to the Silesian station.\n\nThe junction of the Ringbahn with the Stadtbahn and Stralau Rummelsburg station were entirely rebuilt in 1903. The two east\u2013west lines and the Ringbahn were each given a platform for suburban traffic. This development made Stralau-Rummelsburg station one of the biggest stations in Berlin. In 1933 its name was changed to [[Ostkreuz]].\n\nIn the mid-1920s, extensive electrification began on the Berlin suburban lines. Electrification of the Eastern Railway was completed on 6 November 1928. Operation of a mixture of steam and electric trains continued until January 1929. On 15 December 1930, the suburban services were designated as [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] services as far as [[Mahlsdorf railway station|Mahlsdorf station]]. The long-distance platform was removed at Kaulsdorf station.\n\nThe [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania plan]] of the [[Nazis]] envisioned a comprehensive upgrading of the line. The train was to be extended to Strausberg or [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] south of the line. Another pair of long-distance tracks would have been built as far as the Berlin city limits at Mahlsdorf. Since the Eastern Railway was a strategically important route on the basis of its orientation, work continued on this project despite the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1944, the predominantly suburban single-track line to Strausberg was put into operation, but services continued to be operated with steam trains. Electrical operations commenced in 1947-1948 in four stages. The S-Bahn route was later extended on a newly built branch line to [[Strausberg Nord station|Strausberg Nord]].\n\nIn 1989, the [[U5 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn line E]] (now U 5) was extended over the VnK line to [[Berlin Wuhletal station|Wuhletal station]]. It is the only station in Berlin where it is possible to transfer between S-Bahn and U-Bahn services on the same platform. In 1992, [[Birkenstein station]] was opened between Mahlsdorf and [[Hoppegarten (Mark) station|Hoppegarten]]. At the same time a second S-Bahn track went into operation on this section.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n*[[History of rail transport in Germany]]\n*[[History of rail transport in Poland]]\n\n== Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References==\n* {{cite journal| author= Kurt Born |title= Die Entwicklung der k\u00f6niglich preu\u00dfischen Ostbahn. |journal= Archiv f\u00fcr Eisenbahnwesen |volume= 34 |year= 1911 |issue= 4/5/6 |pages= 879\u2013939; 1125\u20131172; 1431\u20131461 |language=German |postscript=&nbsp;(also separate publication: Springer, Berlin 1911)}}\n* {{cite book| author= Andreas Gei\u00dfler, Konrad Koschinski |title=130&nbsp;Jahre Ostbahn Berlin \u2013 K\u00f6nigsberg \u2013 Baltikum. | editor= Deutschen Bahnkunden-Verband e.&nbsp;V. |publisher= GVE |location= Berlin |year= 1997 | ISBN= 3-89218-048-2 |language=German }}\n* {{cite journal| author=Johannes Gl\u00f6ckner |title= Abgetrennt.

It's just her style.\"<ref name=\"famu\" />\n\nEven though her comment created controversy, Storms was adamant in not allowing Florida A&M to open a law school in Tampa. It was eventually opened in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in 2002.\n\n====Child abuser sterilization plan====\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Storms tried to introduce a law which would approve sterilization for men and women convicted of [[child abuse]] in Hillsborough County so that, in her view, child abusers would not be able to continue to produce children that would become abused also.<ref name=\"abuser\">{{cite web|title=Commission backs sterilization for abusers|last=Varian|first=Bill|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/02/03/news_pf/Hillsborough/Commission_backs_ster.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> The original motion was approved by all commissioners in attendance in February 2005.<ref name=\"abuser\" /> When the County Attorney, Ren\u00e9e Lee, made it known to Storms that only the state legislature could pass such statutes, not the County Commission, she made it high priority to lobby for the bill to various legislators.

The statute, which was once law in Tampa, was repealed in 1995 and rejected in 2000. The commissioners, led by Storms, voted 5-2 to reject Castor's statute.

The policy was repealed by the Commission on June 5, 2013, with a 7-0 vote. \"<ref name=\"repeal\">{{cite web|title=Hillsborough commissioners repeal ban on gay promotion|url=http://tbo.com/article/20130605/ARTICLE/130609838/1496|publisher=Tampa Tribune|accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>\n\nVonn New, the central Florida director of [[Equality Florida]], an [[LGBT rights]] group, said, \"I think that Hillsborough County commissioners sent a very clear message that not everyone is welcome here.

The statute, which was once law in Tampa, was repealed in 1995 and rejected in 2000. The commissioners, led by Storms, voted 5-2 to reject Castor's statute. Castor and Thomas Scott were the dissenters. Storms then asked for a motion to raise the number of votes needed from commissioners to place the issue on direct referendum to county voters from four commissioners to five.<ref>{{cite web|title=County Commission votes against gay protection|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/10/06/Hillsborough/County_Commission_vot.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2005, [[Joe Redner]], who owns the nationally known strip club [[Mons Venus]], filed a lawsuit against every Commission member except for Castor, alleging discrimination as a result of the June 15 vote.
