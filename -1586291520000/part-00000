It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country.

The phrase ''Tianchao'' continues to see use on Chinese internet discussion boards, in reference to China.<ref name=tianchao/>\n\nThe phrase ''Tianchao'' was first translated into English and French in the early 19th century, appearing in foreign publicans and diplomatic correspondences,<ref name=mailt>{{cite web|url=https://mailtribune.com/archive/-celestial-origins-come-from-long-ago-in-chinese-history|title='Celestial' origins come from long ago in Chinese history|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=25 November 2019|work=Mail Tribune|publisher=Rosebud Media LLC}}</ref> with the translated phrase \"Celestial Empire\" occasionally used to refer to China. During this period, the term ''celestial'' was used by some to refer to the subjects of the [[Qing dynasty]] in a non-prejudicial manner,<ref name=mailt/> derived from the term \"Celestial Empire\". However, the term ''celestial'' was also used in a pejorative manner during the 19th century, in reference to Chinese immigrants in Australasia and North America.<ref name=mailt/> The translated phrase has largely fallen into disuse in the 20th century.\n\nTranslations for ''Tianxia'' include:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (''Podneb\u00e9snaya''; lit. \"under the heaven\")\n\n=== Jiangshan ===\n''Jiangshan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n}}) literally means \"rivers and mountains\". This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |title = Grounds of Judgment: Extraterritoriality and Imperial Power in Nineteenth-Century China and Japan |first = Par Kristoffer |last=Cassel |volume= |edition= |year = 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qlJpAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0199792122 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Chinas religionen ...|first=Rudolf |last=Dvo\u0159\u00e1k |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition=illustrated |year=1895 |publisher = Aschendorff (Druck und Verlag der Aschendorffschen Buchhandlung) |url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0199792054 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = New Qing Imperial History: The Making of Inner Asian Empire at Qing Chengde |first1=Ruth W. |last1=Dunnell |first2=Mark C. |last2=Elliott |first3=Philippe |last3=Foret |first4=James A |last4=Millward |volume=|edition=|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 1134362226 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|first=Mark C. |last=Elliott |volume=|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0804746842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Mandschusprache |first = Erich |last= Hauer |editor-first = Oliver |editor-last = Corff |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition = illustrated |year = 2007 |publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url = https://books.google.com/?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-3447055284 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |first = Joseph |last= Esherick |chapter=How the Qing Became China |title =Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia |first=Peter C. |last=Perdue |volume= |edition=reprint |year=2009 |publisher = Harvard University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0674042025 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Geoff |url = http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf |title = The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China' |journal = Sino-Platonic Papers |volume = 188 |date = May 2009 |accessdate= 4 October 2011 |ref=harv}} \n*{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion|year=2012 |title=Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute }}\n* {{cite book |last = Wilkinson |first = Endymion |year = 2015 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual, 4th edition |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center distributed by Harvard University Press |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674088467 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Die Eroberung von Qinghai unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Tibet und Khams 1717 -

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as ''Zhongguo'' (see the discussion below).<ref>{{harvp|Esherick|2006|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n''Dulimbai Gurun'' is the Manchu name for China.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&pg=PA117&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Hauer 2007], p. 117.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-0PtUoKZEKWgyAH8oIHgBQ&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 1895], p. 80.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqVug_wN4hEC&pg=PA102&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0PtUtv-OIOTyQHX8YCwAQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Wu 1995], p. 102.</ref> The historian Zhao Gang writes that \"not long after the collapse of the Ming, China [Zhongguo] became the equivalent of Great Qing (Da Qing)\u2014another official title of the Qing state\", and  \"Qing and China became interchangeable official titles, and the latter often appeared as a substitute for the former in official documents.\"{{sfnb|Zhao|2006| p = 7}}  The Qing dynasty referred to their realm as \"''Dulimbai Gurun''\" in Manchu.

This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.\n\n== Official names ==\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=People's Republic of China\n|pic=PRC (Chinese characters.svg\n|piccap=\"People's Republic of China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=1.15\n|t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b}}\n|s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}\n|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|gr=Jonghwa Renmin Gonqhergwo\n|mps=J\u016bnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|w=Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2 J\u00ean\u00b2-min\u00b2<br />Kung\u2074-ho\u00b2-kuo\u00b2\n|tp=Jhonghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|myr=J\u016bnghw\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gw\u00f3\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2|-|r|en|2|.|m|in|2|-|g|ong|4|.|h|e|2|.|g|wo|2}}\n|sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> hua<sup>2</sup> Zen<sup>2</sup> min<sup>2</sup><br />Gong<sup>4</sup> hwe<sup>2</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n|bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca<br />\u3116\u3123\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3107\u3127\u3123\u02ca<br />\u310d\u3128\u3125\u02cb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u311c\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n|xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \u0698\u064c\u0645\u064d \ufed7\u0652\ufeee\u062d\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0639\n|zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0445\u04d9\u0433\u0443\u0439\n|poj=Tiong-h\u00f4a J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|tl=Tiong-hu\u00e2 J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|gan=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet\n|wuu=tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup> zin<sup>\u5e73</sup> min<sup>\u5e73</sup><br />gon<sup>\u53bb</sup> ghu<sup>\u5e73</sup> koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n|j=Zung1waa4 Jan4man4 Gung6wo4gwok3\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}<br />''or''<br />{{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}\n|y=J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok<br />''or''<br />J\u016bng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok\n|hsn=/tan<sup>33</sup> go<sup>13</sup> \u014bin<sup>13</sup> min<sup>13</sup><br />gan<sup>45</sup> gu<sup>13</sup> kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n|h=dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup> ngin<sup>11</sup> min<sup>11</sup><br />kiung<sup>55</sup> fo<sup>11</sup> gued<sup>2</sup>\n|phfs=Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 Ng\u00ecn-m\u00ecn<br />Khiung-f\u00f2-koet\n|buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 \u00ccng-m\u00ecng<br />G\u00ea\u0324\u1e73ng-hu\u00f2-gu\u00f3k\n|hhbuc=De\u0324ng-hu\u00e1 C\u00edng-m\u00edng<br />G\u0113\u0324ng-h\u00f3\u0324-go\u0324h\n|mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-u\u01ce N\u00eang-m\u011bng<br />G\u014d\u0324ng-u\u01ce-g\u014f\n|mong=[[File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, \u182a\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1833\u1821 \u1828\u1820\u1836\u1822\u1837\u1820\u182e\u1833\u1820\u182c\u1824 \u1833\u1824\u182e\u1833\u1820\u1833\u1824 \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u182f\u1824\u1830]]\n|monr=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus\n|tib={{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f67\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72<br />\u0f58\u0f50\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56}}\n|wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab\n|zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab\n|uig=\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u062e\u06c7\u0627 \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u062c\u06c7\u0645\u06be\u06c7\u0631\u0649\u064a\u0649\u062a\u0649\n|uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti\n|uyy=Junghua H\u0259l\u2c6a Jum\u2c68uriyiti\n|sgs=Junghua H\u00e4lk\u0302 Jum\u0125uriyiti\n|usy=\u0496\u0443\u04a3\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0425\u04d9\u043b\u049b \u0496\u0443\u043c\u04bb\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0438\u0442\u0438\n|zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz\n|mnc=\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873<br />\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820\u1873\u1875\u1864\u185d\u1828<br />\u1864\u1860\u1828\u1865\u185d \u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828\n|mnc_rom=Dulimbai niyalmairgen gunghe' gurun\n|showflag=p\n|order = st\n}}\n\nThe name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as \"'''Communist China'''\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe official name of

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"'''[[Taiwan]]'''\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u532a\u5340}}) by the ROC).

Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;

The expansion of communist influence into [[Eastern Europe]] following Germany's defeat worried the liberal free market economies of the West, particularly the United States, which had established virtual economic and political primacy in Western Europe. The two nations promoted two opposing economic and political ideologies and the two nations competed for international influence along these lines.

With its growing influence on [[Eastern Europe]], the Soviet Union sought to counter this with the [[Comecon]] in 1949, which essentially did the same thing, though was more an economic cooperation agreement instead of a clear plan to rebuild. The United States and its [[Western European]] allies sought to strengthen their bonds and spite the Soviet Union.

The U.S./USSR d\u00e9tente was presented as an applied extension of that thinking. The SALT II pact of the late 1970s continued the work of the SALT I talks, ensuring further reduction in arms by the Soviets and by the U.S. The Helsinki Accords, in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe, has been called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets.\n\nD\u00e9tente ended after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]], which led to the United States [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow]].

With its growing influence on [[Eastern Europe]], the Soviet Union sought to counter this with the [[Comecon]] in 1949, which essentially did the same thing, though was more an economic cooperation agreement instead of a clear plan to rebuild. The United States and its [[Western European]] allies sought to strengthen their bonds and spite the Soviet Union. They accomplished this most notably through the formation of [[NATO]] which was essentially a military agreement. The Soviet Union countered with the [[Warsaw Pact]], which had similar results with the [[Eastern Bloc]].\n\n[[Image:Glassboro-meeting1967.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] with U.S. President [[Lyndon B.

They wanted to end the [[containment]] policy and gain friendlier relations with the USSR and China.  Those two were rivals and Nixon expected they would go along with Washington as to not give the other rival an advantage.  One of Nixon's terms is that both nations had to stop helping North Vietnam in the [[Vietnam War]], which they did. Nixon and Kissinger promoted greater dialogue with the Soviet government, including regular summit meetings and negotiations over arms control and other bilateral agreements.  Brezhnev met with Nixon at summits in Moscow in 1972, in Washington in 1973, and, again in Moscow in 1974. They became personal friends.<ref>Donald J.

The SALT II pact of the late 1970s continued the work of the SALT I talks, ensuring further reduction in arms by the Soviets and by the U.S. The Helsinki Accords, in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe, has been called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets.\n\nD\u00e9tente ended after the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]], which led to the United States [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow]].

There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]].

Thus, the node Pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|142052508|142052508}}) has two parents: Lung infections (entity id: {{ICD11|915779102|915779102}}) and Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (entity id: {{ICD11|1435254666|1435254666}}). The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisoning]]s, [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes. These are the 'Other specified' and 'Unspecified' categories, miscellaneous classes which can be used to code conditions that do not fit with any of the more specific MMS entities.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=2.3.3 Residual categories \u2013 \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Unspecified\u2019 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#2.03CodeAlso%7Cresidual-categories-other-and-unspecified%7Cc2-3-3 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> In the ICD-11 Browser, residual nodes are displayed in a [[maroon]] color.<ref>[[Talk:ICD-11#Residual nodes are maroon-colored]]</ref> Residual categories are not in the Foundation, and therefore are the only classes with derivative entity ids: their ids are the same as their parent nodes, with \"/mms/otherspecified\" or \"/mms/unspecified\" tagged at the end. Their ICD codes always end with Y for 'Other specified' categories, or Z for 'Unspecified' categories (e.g. {{ICD11|1C4Y}} and {{ICD11|1C4Z}}).\n\n==Chapters==\nBelow is a list of all chapters of the ICD-11 MMS, the primary linearization of the Foundation Component.\n\n{| \n| {{ordered list|\n| [[ICD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|'''1A00\u20131H0Z''' &nbsp;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases]]\n| '''2A00\u20132F9Z''' &nbsp;Neoplasms\n| '''3A00\u20133C0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\n| '''4A00\u20134B4Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the immune system\n| '''5A00\u20135D46''' &nbsp;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\n| '''6A00\u20136E8Z''' &nbsp;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders\n| '''7A00\u20137B2Z''' &nbsp;Sleep-wake disorders\n| '''8A00\u20138E7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the nervous system\n| '''9A00\u20139E1Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the visual system\n| '''AA00\u2013AC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\n| '''BA00\u2013BE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the circulatory system\n| '''CA00\u2013CB7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the respiratory system\n| '''DA00\u2013DE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the digestive system\n| '''EA00\u2013EM0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the skin\n}}\n| {{ordered list|start=15\n| '''FA00\u2013FC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\n| '''GA00\u2013GC8Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the genitourinary system\n| '''HA00\u2013HA8Z''' &nbsp;Conditions related to sexual health\n| '''JA00\u2013JB6Z''' &nbsp;Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium\n| '''KA00\u2013KD5Z''' &nbsp;Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period\n| '''LA00\u2013LD9Z''' &nbsp;Developmental anomalies\n| '''MA00\u2013MH2Y''' &nbsp;Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\n| '''NA00\u2013NF2Z''' &nbsp;Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\n| '''PA00\u2013PL2Z''' &nbsp;External causes of morbidity or mortality\n| '''QA00\u2013QF4Z''' &nbsp;Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\n| '''RA00\u2013RA26''' &nbsp;Codes for special purposes\n| '''SA00\u2013SJ3Z''' &nbsp;Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I\n| '''VA00\u2013VC50''' &nbsp;Supplementary section for functioning assessment\n| '''X...\u2013X...''' &nbsp;Extension Codes\n}}\n|}\n\nUnlike the [[ICD-10]], the ICD-11 MMS features no codes beginning with \"I\" or \"O\". This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Mania|Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}). The ICD-11 merges both groups together as [[Anxiety or fear-related disorders]] ({{ICD11|1336943699|1336943699}}).\n* All [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] ({{ICD10|F84}}) are merged into one category, [[Autism spectrum disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A02}}), except for [[Rett syndrome]], which is moved to the developmental anomalies chapter ({{ICD11|LD90.4}}).\n* [[Hyperkinetic disorders]] ({{ICD10|F90}}) is renamed [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A05}}), and a distinction in subtypes is made between [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive]] ({{ICD11|6A05.0}}), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ({{ICD11|6A05.1}}), and combined ({{ICD11|6A05.2}}). Hyperkinetic conduct disorder ({{ICD10|F90.1}}) has been removed.\n* [[Acute stress reaction]] ({{ICD10|F43.0}}) has been moved out of the mental disorder chapter, and placed in the chapter \"Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\" ({{ICD11|QE84}}). Thus, in the ICD-11, Acute stress reaction is no longer considered a mental disorder.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Jonathan D. | last=Raskin | title=What\u2019s New in the International Classification of Diseases? | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | website=[[Psychology Today]] | date=25 July 2018 | archive-url=https://archive.fo/20200405171146/https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | archive-date=5 April 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAsides from the updates made for the ICD-11, the WHO has also created an ICD-11 version of the ''Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines'' (CDDG). A book of the same name was released in 1992<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_ICD_10_Classification_of_Mental_and.html?id=DFM0DgAAQBAJ Google Books entry on the CDDG]</ref> for the ICD-10, which was also known as the \"Blue Book\". It contains expanded definitions and diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders, whereas the ICD-10/-11 mental disorders chapters contain only short summaries. The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category. Many \u2013 though by no means all \u2013 clinicians appear to be aligned with the latter position. In the absence of more definitive data, there seemed to be little hope of accommodating these opposing views. However, the WHO took seriously the concerns being expressed that access to services for patients with borderline PD, which has increasingly been achieved in some countries based on arguments of treatment efficacy, might be seriously undermined.\"<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> Thus, the WHO believed the inclusion of a Borderline pattern category to be a \"pragmatic compromise\".<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Jay | last=Watts | date=2019 | title=Problems with the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30127-0/fulltext | journal=[[The Lancet Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=461-463 | doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30127-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) included near the end of the [[DSM-5]] is similar to the PD-system of the ICD-11, although much larger and more comprehensive.<ref>[[DSM-5]], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT1241&pg=PT1212#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 761-781].</ref> It was considered for inclusion in the ICD-11, but the WHO decided against it because it was considered \"too complicated for implementation in most clinical settings around the world\",<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> since an explicit aim of the WHO was to develop a simple and efficient method that could also be used in low-resource settings.<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\" />\n\n====Gaming disorder====\n[[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) has been newly added to the ICD-11, and placed in the group \"Disorders due to addictive behaviours\", alongside [[Gambling disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C50}}). The latter was called Pathological gambling ({{ICD10|F63.0}}) in the ICD-10. Aside from Gaming disorder, the ICD-11 also features Hazardous gaming ({{ICD11|QE22}}), an ancillary category that can be used to identify problematic gaming which does not rise to the level of a disorder.\n\nAlthough a majority<ref name=\"Rumpf_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Hans-J\u00fcrgen | last=Rumpf | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Including gaming disorder in the ICD-11: The need to do so from a clinical and public health perspective | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326427203_Including_gaming_disorder_in_the_ICD-11_The_need_to_do_so_from_a_clinical_and_public_health_perspective_Commentary_on_A_weak_scientific_basis_for_gaming_disorder_Let_us_err_on_the_side_of_caution_van_ | journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Addictions]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=556-561 |doi=10.1556/2006.7.2018.59 | quote=<small>Their arguments led to a series of commentaries, most of which were in favor of including the new diagnosis of GD in the ICD-11.</small>}}</ref> of scholars supported the inclusion of Gaming disorder (GD), a significant number did not.

In the ICD-11, the brain and the body [[Holism|are seen as an integrate whole]], with sexual dysfunctions considered to involve an interaction between physical and psychological factors.

The ICD-11 replaces these with two main categories: [[Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA00}}) and [[Sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01}}). The latter has two subcategories: [[Female sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.0}}) and [[Male erectile dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.1}}). The difference between Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction and Sexual arousal dysfunction is that in the former, there is a reduced or absent desire for sexual activity. In the latter, there is insufficient physical and emotional response to sexual activity, even though there still is a ''desire'' to engage in satisfying sex. The WHO acknowledged that there is an overlap between desire and arousal, but they are not the same. Management should focus on their distinct features.<ref>Reed et al. (2016): <small>\"Although there is significant comorbidity between desire and arousal dysfunction, the overlap of these conditions does not mean that they are one and the same; research suggests that management should be targeted toward their distinct features.\"</small></ref>\n\nThe ICD-10 contains the categories [[Vaginismus]] ({{ICD10|N94.2}}), Nonorganic vaginismus ({{ICD10|F52.5}}), [[Dyspareunia]] ({{ICD10|N94.1}}), and Nonorganic dyspareunia ({{ICD10|F52.6}}). As the WHO aimed to steer away from the aforementioned \"outdated mind/body split\", the organic and nonorganic disorders were merged. Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10. It has been re-added to the ICD-11 ({{ICD11|GA34.02}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\nSexual dysfunctions and Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder can be coded alongside a temporal qualifier, \"lifelong\" or \"acquired\", and a situational qualifier, \"general\" or \"situational\". Furthermore, the ICD-11 offers five aetiological qualifiers, or \"Associated with\u2026\" categories, to further specify the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> For example, a woman who experiences sexual problems [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction|due to adverse effects of an SSRI antidepressant]] may be diagnosed with \"Female sexual arousal dysfunction, acquired, generalised\" ({{ICD11|HA01.02}}) combined with \"Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication\" ({{ICD11|HA40.2}}).\n\n====Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder====\n[[Excessive sexual drive]] ({{ICD10|F52.7}}) from the ICD-10 has been reclassified as [[Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder]] (CSBD, {{ICD11|6C72}}) and listed under Impulse control disorders. The WHO was unwilling to overpathologize sexual behaviour, stating that having a high [[Libido|sexual drive]] is not necessarily a disorder, so long as these people do not exhibit impaired control over their behavior, significant distress, or impairment in functioning.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Shane W. | last=Kraus | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20499 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=109-110 | doi=10.1002/wps.20499}}</ref> Kraus et al.

Experiencing shame and guilt about sex is not a reliable indicator of a sex disorder, Kraus stated.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\nThere was debate on whether CSBD should be considered a (behavioral) addiction. It has been claimed that [[neuroimaging]] shows overlap between compulsive sexual behavior and substance-use disorder through common [[neurotransmitter]] systems.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Shane W. | last1=Kraus | first2=Valerie | last2=Voon | first3=Marc N. | last3=Potenza | date=2016 | title=Should compulsive sexual behavior be considered an addiction? | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990495/ | journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume=111 | issue=12 | pages=2097\u20132106 | doi=10.1111/add.13297}}</ref> Nonetheless, it was ultimately decided to place the disorder in the Impulse control disorders group. Kraus et al. wrote that, for the ICD-11, \"a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder [CSBD] are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming\".<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\n====Paraphilic disorders====\n[[Paraphilic disorders]], called Disorders of sexual preference in the ICD-10, have remained in the mental disorders chapter, although they have gray nodes in the sexual health chapter. The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders. [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}) has been newly added.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\n====Gender incongruence====\n[[Transgenderism]] and [[gender dysphoria]] are called Gender incongruence in the ICD-11. In the ICD-10, the group Gender identity disorders ({{ICD10|F64}}) consisted of three main categories: [[Transsexualism]] ({{ICD10|F64.0}}), [[Dual-role transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F64.1}}), and [[Gender identity disorder of childhood]] ({{ICD10|F64.2}}). In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have. Since this causes mental distress, it was consequently considered a mental disorder, with distress or discomfort being a core diagnostic feature.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Jack | last1=Drescher | first2=Peggy | last2=Cohen-Kettenis | first3=Sam | last3=Winter | date=2012 | title=Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11 | journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=568\u2013577 | doi=10.3109/09540261.2012.741575 | quote=<small>Until the middle of the 20th century, with rare exceptions, transgender presentations were usually classified as psychopathological.</small>}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Peggy T | last1=Cohen-Kettenis | first2=Friedemann | last2=Pf\u00e4fflin | title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38019925_The_DSM_Diagnostic_Criteria_for_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_and_Adults | journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=39 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9562-y | quote=<small>The DSM has consistently approached gender problems from the position that a divergence between the assigned sex or \u201cthe\u201d physical sex (assuming that \u201cphysical sex\u201d is a one-dimensional construct) and \u201cthe\u201d psychological sex (gender) per se signals a psychiatric disorder.

An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a [[pathogen]], but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]]. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the '''ICD-11 MMS''', and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Christopher G. | last=Chute | date=2018 | title=The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959961/ | journal=[[Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=563\u2013569 | doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0172-5 | quote=<small>The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is \u201cthe ICD-11\u201d, is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization.</small>}}</ref> MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.

Thus, the node Pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|142052508|142052508}}) has two parents: Lung infections (entity id: {{ICD11|915779102|915779102}}) and Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (entity id: {{ICD11|1435254666|1435254666}}). The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisoning]]s, [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes. These are the 'Other specified' and 'Unspecified' categories, miscellaneous classes which can be used to code conditions that do not fit with any of the more specific MMS entities.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=2.3.3 Residual categories \u2013 \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Unspecified\u2019 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#2.03CodeAlso%7Cresidual-categories-other-and-unspecified%7Cc2-3-3 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> In the ICD-11 Browser, residual nodes are displayed in a [[maroon]] color.<ref>[[Talk:ICD-11#Residual nodes are maroon-colored]]</ref> Residual categories are not in the Foundation, and therefore are the only classes with derivative entity ids: their ids are the same as their parent nodes, with \"/mms/otherspecified\" or \"/mms/unspecified\" tagged at the end. Their ICD codes always end with Y for 'Other specified' categories, or Z for 'Unspecified' categories (e.g. {{ICD11|1C4Y}} and {{ICD11|1C4Z}}).\n\n==Chapters==\nBelow is a list of all chapters of the ICD-11 MMS, the primary linearization of the Foundation Component.\n\n{| \n| {{ordered list|\n| [[ICD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|'''1A00\u20131H0Z''' &nbsp;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases]]\n| '''2A00\u20132F9Z''' &nbsp;Neoplasms\n| '''3A00\u20133C0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\n| '''4A00\u20134B4Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the immune system\n| '''5A00\u20135D46''' &nbsp;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\n| '''6A00\u20136E8Z''' &nbsp;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders\n| '''7A00\u20137B2Z''' &nbsp;Sleep-wake disorders\n| '''8A00\u20138E7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the nervous system\n| '''9A00\u20139E1Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the visual system\n| '''AA00\u2013AC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\n| '''BA00\u2013BE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the circulatory system\n| '''CA00\u2013CB7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the respiratory system\n| '''DA00\u2013DE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the digestive system\n| '''EA00\u2013EM0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the skin\n}}\n| {{ordered list|start=15\n| '''FA00\u2013FC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\n| '''GA00\u2013GC8Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the genitourinary system\n| '''HA00\u2013HA8Z''' &nbsp;Conditions related to sexual health\n| '''JA00\u2013JB6Z''' &nbsp;Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium\n| '''KA00\u2013KD5Z''' &nbsp;Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period\n| '''LA00\u2013LD9Z''' &nbsp;Developmental anomalies\n| '''MA00\u2013MH2Y''' &nbsp;Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\n| '''NA00\u2013NF2Z''' &nbsp;Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\n| '''PA00\u2013PL2Z''' &nbsp;External causes of morbidity or mortality\n| '''QA00\u2013QF4Z''' &nbsp;Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\n| '''RA00\u2013RA26''' &nbsp;Codes for special purposes\n| '''SA00\u2013SJ3Z''' &nbsp;Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I\n| '''VA00\u2013VC50''' &nbsp;Supplementary section for functioning assessment\n| '''X...\u2013X...''' &nbsp;Extension Codes\n}}\n|}\n\nUnlike the [[ICD-10]], the ICD-11 MMS features no codes beginning with \"I\" or \"O\". This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Mania|Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}).

A book of the same name was released in 1992<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_ICD_10_Classification_of_Mental_and.html?id=DFM0DgAAQBAJ Google Books entry on the CDDG]</ref> for the ICD-10, which was also known as the \"Blue Book\". It contains expanded definitions and diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders, whereas the ICD-10/-11 mental disorders chapters contain only short summaries. The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category. Many \u2013 though by no means all \u2013 clinicians appear to be aligned with the latter position. In the absence of more definitive data, there seemed to be little hope of accommodating these opposing views. However, the WHO took seriously the concerns being expressed that access to services for patients with borderline PD, which has increasingly been achieved in some countries based on arguments of treatment efficacy, might be seriously undermined.\"<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> Thus, the WHO believed the inclusion of a Borderline pattern category to be a \"pragmatic compromise\".<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Jay | last=Watts | date=2019 | title=Problems with the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30127-0/fulltext | journal=[[The Lancet Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=461-463 | doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30127-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) included near the end of the [[DSM-5]] is similar to the PD-system of the ICD-11, although much larger and more comprehensive.<ref>[[DSM-5]], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT1241&pg=PT1212#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 761-781].</ref> It was considered for inclusion in the ICD-11, but the WHO decided against it because it was considered \"too complicated for implementation in most clinical settings around the world\",<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> since an explicit aim of the WHO was to develop a simple and efficient method that could also be used in low-resource settings.<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\" />\n\n====Gaming disorder====\n[[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) has been newly added to the ICD-11, and placed in the group \"Disorders due to addictive behaviours\", alongside [[Gambling disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C50}}). The latter was called Pathological gambling ({{ICD10|F63.0}}) in the ICD-10. Aside from Gaming disorder, the ICD-11 also features Hazardous gaming ({{ICD11|QE22}}), an ancillary category that can be used to identify problematic gaming which does not rise to the level of a disorder.\n\nAlthough a majority<ref name=\"Rumpf_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Hans-J\u00fcrgen | last=Rumpf | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Including gaming disorder in the ICD-11: The need to do so from a clinical and public health perspective | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326427203_Including_gaming_disorder_in_the_ICD-11_The_need_to_do_so_from_a_clinical_and_public_health_perspective_Commentary_on_A_weak_scientific_basis_for_gaming_disorder_Let_us_err_on_the_side_of_caution_van_ | journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Addictions]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=556-561 |doi=10.1556/2006.7.2018.59 | quote=<small>Their arguments led to a series of commentaries, most of which were in favor of including the new diagnosis of GD in the ICD-11.</small>}}</ref> of scholars supported the inclusion of Gaming disorder (GD), a significant number did not.

Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10. It has been re-added to the ICD-11 ({{ICD11|GA34.02}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\nSexual dysfunctions and Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder can be coded alongside a temporal qualifier, \"lifelong\" or \"acquired\", and a situational qualifier, \"general\" or \"situational\". Furthermore, the ICD-11 offers five aetiological qualifiers, or \"Associated with\u2026\" categories, to further specify the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> For example, a woman who experiences sexual problems [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction|due to adverse effects of an SSRI antidepressant]] may be diagnosed with \"Female sexual arousal dysfunction, acquired, generalised\" ({{ICD11|HA01.02}}) combined with \"Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication\" ({{ICD11|HA40.2}}).\n\n====Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder====\n[[Excessive sexual drive]] ({{ICD10|F52.7}}) from the ICD-10 has been reclassified as [[Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder]] (CSBD, {{ICD11|6C72}}) and listed under Impulse control disorders. The WHO was unwilling to overpathologize sexual behaviour, stating that having a high [[Libido|sexual drive]] is not necessarily a disorder, so long as these people do not exhibit impaired control over their behavior, significant distress, or impairment in functioning.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Shane W. | last=Kraus | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20499 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=109-110 | doi=10.1002/wps.20499}}</ref> Kraus et al. (2018) noted that several people self-identify as \"sex addicts\", but on closer examination do not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of a sexual disorder, although they may have other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression. Experiencing shame and guilt about sex is not a reliable indicator of a sex disorder, Kraus stated.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\nThere was debate on whether CSBD should be considered a (behavioral) addiction. It has been claimed that [[neuroimaging]] shows overlap between compulsive sexual behavior and substance-use disorder through common [[neurotransmitter]] systems.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Shane W. | last1=Kraus | first2=Valerie | last2=Voon | first3=Marc N. | last3=Potenza | date=2016 | title=Should compulsive sexual behavior be considered an addiction? | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990495/ | journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume=111 | issue=12 | pages=2097\u20132106 | doi=10.1111/add.13297}}</ref> Nonetheless, it was ultimately decided to place the disorder in the Impulse control disorders group. Kraus et al. wrote that, for the ICD-11, \"a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder [CSBD] are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming\".<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\n====Paraphilic disorders====\n[[Paraphilic disorders]], called Disorders of sexual preference in the ICD-10, have remained in the mental disorders chapter, although they have gray nodes in the sexual health chapter. The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders. [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}) has been newly added.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\n====Gender incongruence====\n[[Transgenderism]] and [[gender dysphoria]] are called Gender incongruence in the ICD-11. In the ICD-10, the group Gender identity disorders ({{ICD10|F64}}) consisted of three main categories: [[Transsexualism]] ({{ICD10|F64.0}}), [[Dual-role transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F64.1}}), and [[Gender identity disorder of childhood]] ({{ICD10|F64.2}}). In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have. Since this causes mental distress, it was consequently considered a mental disorder, with distress or discomfort being a core diagnostic feature.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Jack | last1=Drescher | first2=Peggy | last2=Cohen-Kettenis | first3=Sam | last3=Winter | date=2012 | title=Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11 | journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=568\u2013577 | doi=10.3109/09540261.2012.741575 | quote=<small>Until the middle of the 20th century, with rare exceptions, transgender presentations were usually classified as psychopathological.</small>}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Peggy T | last1=Cohen-Kettenis | first2=Friedemann | last2=Pf\u00e4fflin | title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38019925_The_DSM_Diagnostic_Criteria_for_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_and_Adults | journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=39 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9562-y | quote=<small>The DSM has consistently approached gender problems from the position that a divergence between the assigned sex or \u201cthe\u201d physical sex (assuming that \u201cphysical sex\u201d is a one-dimensional construct) and \u201cthe\u201d psychological sex (gender) per se signals a psychiatric disorder.

It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in [[Monarchies in Europe|other European monarchies]], all of which have abandoned coronations in favour of [[inauguration]] or [[enthronement]] ceremonies.\n\nThe [[coronation]] usually takes place several months after the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, [[Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] was crowned on 2&nbsp;June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6&nbsp;February 1952; the date of [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|her coronation]] was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.\n\nThe ceremony is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the most senior cleric in the [[Church of England]], of which the monarch is [[supreme governor]]. Other clergy and members of the [[British nobility|nobility]] also have roles; most participants in the ceremony are required to wear ceremonial uniforms or robes and [[coronet]]s. Many other government officials and guests attend, including representatives of other countries.\n\nThe essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. Following that, the monarch is [[anointing|anointed]] with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]], invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as [[queen consort]]. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] to appear later on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]], before attending a banquet there.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development of the English coronation===\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene29-30-31 Harold coronation.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Harold II of England]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1066. From the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]\nThe main elements of the coronation service and the earliest form of oath can be traced to the ceremony devised by [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] for [[Edgar of England|Edgar]]'s coronation in 973 AD at [[Bath Abbey]]. It drew on ceremonies used by the kings of the [[Franks]] and those used in the [[ordination]] of [[bishop]]s. Two versions of coronation services, known as ''ordines'' (from the Latin ''ordo'' meaning \"order\") or [[Wikt:recension|recension]]s, survive from before the [[Norman Conquest]]. It is not known if the first recension was ever used in England and it was the second recension which was used by Edgar in 973 and by subsequent [[Anglo-Saxon]] and early [[Normans|Norman]] kings.<ref>Gosling, pp. 5\u20137.</ref> \n[[File:Coronation Henry4 England 01.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Henry IV of England]] at Westminster in 1399]]\nA third recension was probably compiled during the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry&nbsp;I]] and was used at the coronation of his successor, [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from the ''[[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]]'', a book of German liturgy compiled in [[Mainz]] in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.<ref>Strong, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> It remained in use until the coronation of [[Edward&nbsp;II]] in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades.

The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the [[Bishop of Glasgow]], because the [[Archbishop of St&nbsp;Andrews]] had been killed at the [[Battle of Flodden]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> It is likely that the child would have been [[knight]]ed before the start of the ceremony.<ref>Thomas, p. 53.</ref> The coronation itself started with a [[sermon]], followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.<ref>Thomas, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n[[James&nbsp;VI]] had been crowned in [[The Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling]], in 1567 and inherited the English crown in 1603.

The assembly of peers and ceremonial at Westminster Hall involving the presentation of the regalia to the monarch was eliminated. The procession from Westminster Hall to the Abbey on foot was likewise eliminated and in its place, a state procession by coach from [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]] to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.<ref name=\"Strong, p. 401\"/> The coronation banquet after the service proper was also disposed of.\n\nWhen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] was [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|crowned in 1838]], the service followed the pared-down precedent set by her uncle, and the under-rehearsed ceremonial was marred by mistakes and accidents.<ref>Gosling p. 52</ref> The music in the abbey was widely criticised in the press, only one new piece having been written for it and the large choir and orchestra were badly coordinated.<ref>Range, p. 224</ref>\n\nIn the 20th&nbsp;century, liturgical scholars sought to restore the spiritual meaning of the ceremony by rearranging elements with reference to the medieval texts,<ref>Strong, p. 470.</ref> creating a \"complex marriage of innovation and tradition\".<ref>Strong, p. 480.</ref> The greatly increased pageantry of the state processions was intended to emphasise the strength and diversity of the [[British Empire]].<ref>Richards, p. 101</ref>\n\n===Bringing coronations to the people===\n[[File:Coronation Procession of Elizabeth I of England 1559.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Elizabeth I carried from her Coronation in a horse-borne litter, 15 January 1559]]\nThe idea of the need to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the ceremony a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of [[Richard II of England|Richard&nbsp;II]] who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the [[City of London]] by the [[Lord Mayor of London|lord mayor]], [[alderman|aldermen]] and the [[livery companies]], and he was conducted to the [[Tower of London]] where he spent the night in [[vigil]]. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the [[Fountain|public conduit]]s flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in [[Cheapside]], probably to represent the [[New Jerusalem]], where a girl blew [[gold leaf]] over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles&nbsp;II]] in 1661.<ref>Strong, pp. 133\u2013135.</ref> Charles's pageant was watched by [[Samuel Pepys]] who wrote: \"So glorious was the show with gold and silver that we were not able to look at it\". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen<ref>Gosling p. 33</ref> and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from [[Westminster Hall]] to the abbey. For the coronation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;IV]] in 1821, a state procession from [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]] to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.<ref name=\"Strong, p. 401\"/>\n[[File:Coronation of George V 1911 2.jpg|thumb|King George&nbsp;V and Queen Mary seated on the Chairs of Estate in front of the royal box at their coronation in 1911.

Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament.<ref>''The Times'' (London). 29 October 1952. p. 4.</ref> The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20&nbsp;million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.<ref>Strong, pp. 433\u2013435.</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\nThe need to include the various elements of the [[British Empire]] in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and [[governor general|governors-general]] of the [[British Dominion]]s, by then almost completely [[autonomous]], and also by many of the rulers of the [[Indian Princely States]] and the various [[British Protectorate]]s. An [[Imperial Conference]] was held afterwards.<ref>Strong, p. 437.</ref> In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the [[Indian Empire]] along with the traditional banners of the [[Home Nations]]. By 1937, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] had made the dominions fully independent, and the wording of the coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.<ref>Strong, pp. 442\u2013444.</ref>\n\nThus since 1937, the monarch has been simultaneously crowned as sovereign of several independent nations besides the United Kingdom, known since 1953 as the [[Commonwealth realms]].

At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations.

The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of George&nbsp;IV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William&nbsp;IV]] (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]].

Such rights are determined by a special [[Court of Claims (United Kingdom)|Court of Claims]], over which the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of [[Richard II of England|Richard&nbsp;II]]. By the Tudor period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and so [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of the court.<ref name=\"lord-high-steward\"/>\n\nIn 1952, for example, the court accepted the claim of the [[Dean of Westminster]] to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the [[Bishop of Durham|Lord Bishop of Durham]] and the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells]] to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] in his capacity as [[Lord High Steward of Ireland]] to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the [[Queen's Scholar|Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]] to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of \"Vivat!

It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece.

In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|regalia]], it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch.

The purple recalls the imperial robes of [[Roman Emperor]]s.<ref name=\"cox-sovereigns-robes\"/>\n\n====Headwear====\nMale sovereigns up to and including [[George VI]] have traditionally worn a crimson [[cap of maintenance]] for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part of the service. Female sovereigns (and some female consorts) have traditionally worn the [[George IV State Diadem]], first worn by its namesake, [[George IV]]. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with [[St Edward's Crown]] but some have chosen to use other crowns as it weighs 2.23&nbsp;kg (4.9&nbsp;lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter [[Imperial State Crown]].\n\n===Other members of the royal family===\nCertain other members of the royal family wear distinctive robes, most particularly [[queens consort]] (including [[dowagers]]) and [[Princess of the United Kingdom|princesses of the United Kingdom]], all of whom wear purple velvet [[Mantle (clothing)|mantles]] edged with [[ermine]] over their court dresses. Other members of the royal family in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that [[royal duke]]s wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of ermine on the cape and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of the robe.\n\n====Headwear====\n[[Queen consort|Queens consort]] in the 20th century arrived at their coronation bareheaded, and remained so until the point in the service when they were crowned with their own [[Consort crown|crown]]. In the late 17th century and 18th century, queens consort wore [[Mary of Modena's State Crown|Mary of Modena's State Diadem]]. Prior to the 20th century it was not usual for [[Queen dowager|queens dowager]] to attend coronations, but [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] both attended the coronations of George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively, and each wore the crown, minus its arches, with which she had been crowned for the duration of the service.\n\nPrincesses and [[Prince of the United Kingdom|princes of the United Kingdom]] are provided with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-patt\u00e9e alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-patt\u00e9e and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-patt\u00e9e and four strawberry leaves, is used for the children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise be entitled as peers or peeresses.\n\n===Peers===\n[[Image:Earl coronation robes.jpg|thumb|upright|An earl's coronation robes]]\nAll peers and peeresses in attendance are \"expected to wear\" Robes of State, as described below.<ref name=\"Gazette1\">{{London Gazette|issue=39709|page=6351|date=2 December 1952}}</ref> These robes are different to the 'Parliament Robe' (worn on occasion by peers who are members of the House of Lords); all peers summoned to attend wear the Robe of State, regardless of membership of the House of Lords, and peeresses' robes are worn not only by women who are peers in their own right, but also by wives and widows of peers.<ref name=\"CoxRobesPeerage\">{{cite journal|author=Cox, N.| year=1999|title=The Coronation and Parliamentary Robes of the British Peerage|journal=Arma|volume=5|issue=1|pages=289\u2013293}}</ref>{{refn|Peers have two types of robes, the \"Parliamentary Robe\" and the \"Coronation Robe\".

Like their robes, their coronets are differentiated according to rank: the coronet of a duke or duchess is ornamented with eight strawberry leaves, that of a marquess or marchioness has four strawberry leaves alternating with four raised silver balls, that of an earl or countess eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight raised silver balls, that of a viscount or viscountess has sixteen smaller silver balls and that of a baron or baroness six silver balls.

The [[Queen's Champion|King or Queen's Champion]] (the office being held by the [[Dymoke]] family in connection with the [[Manor of Scrivelsby]]) would ride into the hall on horseback, wearing a knight's armour, with the Lord High Constable riding to his right and the Earl Marshal riding to his left.

Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the [[Imperial Crown of India]], was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him.

It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in [[Monarchies in Europe|other European monarchies]], all of which have abandoned coronations in favour of [[inauguration]] or [[enthronement]] ceremonies.\n\nThe [[coronation]] usually takes place several months after the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, [[Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] was crowned on 2&nbsp;June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6&nbsp;February 1952; the date of [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|her coronation]] was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.\n\nThe ceremony is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the most senior cleric in the [[Church of England]], of which the monarch is [[supreme governor]]. Other clergy and members of the [[British nobility|nobility]] also have roles; most participants in the ceremony are required to wear ceremonial uniforms or robes and [[coronet]]s. Many other government officials and guests attend, including representatives of other countries.\n\nThe essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. Following that, the monarch is [[anointing|anointed]] with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]], invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as [[queen consort]]. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] to appear later on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]], before attending a banquet there.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development of the English coronation===\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene29-30-31 Harold coronation.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Harold II of England]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1066. From the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]\nThe main elements of the coronation service and the earliest form of oath can be traced to the ceremony devised by [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] for [[Edgar of England|Edgar]]'s coronation in 973 AD at [[Bath Abbey]]. It drew on ceremonies used by the kings of the [[Franks]] and those used in the [[ordination]] of [[bishop]]s. Two versions of coronation services, known as ''ordines'' (from the Latin ''ordo'' meaning \"order\") or [[Wikt:recension|recension]]s, survive from before the [[Norman Conquest]]. It is not known if the first recension was ever used in England and it was the second recension which was used by Edgar in 973 and by subsequent [[Anglo-Saxon]] and early [[Normans|Norman]] kings.<ref>Gosling, pp. 5\u20137.</ref> \n[[File:Coronation Henry4 England 01.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Henry IV of England]] at Westminster in 1399]]\nA third recension was probably compiled during the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry&nbsp;I]] and was used at the coronation of his successor, [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from the ''[[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]]'', a book of German liturgy compiled in [[Mainz]] in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.<ref>Strong, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> It remained in use until the coronation of [[Edward&nbsp;II]] in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ''ordo'' focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings.<ref>Strong, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> One manuscript of this recension is the ''[[Liber Regalis]]'' at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.<ref>Strong, p. 84.</ref>\n\nFollowing the start of the [[reformation in England]], the boy king [[Edward VI]] had been crowned in the first [[Protestant]] coronation in 1547, during which Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]] preached a sermon against [[idolatry]] and \"the tyranny of the bishops of Rome\". However, six years later, he was succeeded by his half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who restored the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] rite.<ref>Strong, pp. 204\u2013206.</ref> In 1559, [[Elizabeth I]] underwent the [[Coronation of Elizabeth I of England|last English coronation under the auspices of the Catholic Church]]; however, Elizabeth's insistence on changes to reflect her Protestant beliefs resulted in several bishops refusing to officiate at the service and it was conducted by the low-ranking [[Bishop of Carlisle]], [[Owen Oglethorpe]].<ref>Strong, p. 208.</ref>\n\n===Scottish coronations===\n[[File:Alexander III and Ollamh R\u00edgh.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alexander&nbsp;III of Scotland]] at his coronation aged eight at [[Scone Abbey]] in 1249, being greeted by the royal poet who will recite the king's genealogy]]\nScottish coronations were traditionally held at [[Scone Abbey]], with the king seated on the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]]. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], based on the inauguration of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in|Aidan]] by [[Columba]] in 574, and by the [[Picts]] from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown does not seem to have been used until the inauguration of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander&nbsp;II]] in 1214. The ceremony included the [[laying on of hands]] by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's [[genealogy]].<ref name =\"Thomas_pp.46-47\">Thomas, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> After the coronation of [[John Balliol]], the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296 and taken to Westminster Abbey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/stoneofscone/index.html|title=Stone of Scone|website=Undiscovered Scotland|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref> It was later incorporated into the English [[Coronation Chair]] and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of Henry&nbsp;IV in 1399.<ref>Strong, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> [[Pope John&nbsp;XXII]] in a [[Papal bull|bull]] of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned.<ref name =\"Thomas_pp.46-47\"/> No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant [[James&nbsp;V]] at [[Stirling Castle]] in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the [[Bishop of Glasgow]], because the [[Archbishop of St&nbsp;Andrews]] had been killed at the [[Battle of Flodden]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> It is likely that the child would have been [[knight]]ed before the start of the ceremony.<ref>Thomas, p. 53.</ref> The coronation itself started with a [[sermon]], followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.<ref>Thomas, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n[[James&nbsp;VI]] had been crowned in [[The Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling]], in 1567 and inherited the English crown in 1603. [[Charles I of England|Charles&nbsp;I]] travelled north for a Scottish coronation at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1633,<ref>Range, p. 43.</ref> but caused consternation amongst the [[Presbyterian]] Scots by his insistence on elaborate [[High Anglican]] ritual, arousing \"gryt feir of inbriginge of poperie\".<ref>Strong, p. 257.</ref> [[Charles II of England|Charles&nbsp;II]] underwent a simple Presbyterian coronation ceremony at Scone in 1651, but his brother [[James II and VII]] was never crowned in Scotland, although Scottish peers attended his coronation in London, setting a precedent for future ceremonies.<ref>Strong, p. 351.</ref>\n\n===Modern coronations===\n[[File:Coronation Procession of James II.jpg|thumb|Partial illustration of the State Procession prior to the Coronation of [[James II]] and [[Mary of Modena]] at Westminster, 23 April 1685]]\nThe ''Liber Regalis'' was translated into English for the first time for the coronation of James&nbsp;I in 1601, partly as a result of the [[reformation in England]] requiring services to be understood by the people,<ref>Gosling, p. 10.</ref> but also an attempt by [[antiquarian]]s to recover a lost English identity from before the Norman Conquest.<ref>Strong, p. 244</ref> In 1685, James II, who was a Catholic, ordered a truncated version of the service omitting the [[Eucharist]], but this was restored for later monarchs. Only four years later, the service was again revised by [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] for the coronation of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKY4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA14|title=The Coronation Service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II|publisher=HMSO|year=1953|pages=14\u201317}}</ref> The Latin text was resurrected for the 1714 coronation of the German-speaking [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], since it was the only common language between the king and the clergy. Perhaps because the 1761 coronation of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] had been beset by \"numerous mistakes and stupidities\",<ref>Gosling pp. 54\u201355</ref> the next time around, spectacle overshadowed the religious aspect of the service. [[George IV]]\u2019s 1821 coronation was an expensive and lavish affair with a vast amount of money being spent on it.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/10541|title=George IV (1762\u20131830)|first=Christopher|last=Hibbert }}</ref>\n\nGeorge's brother and successor [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] had to be persuaded to be crowned at all; his coronation at a time of economic depression in 1831 cost only one sixth of that spent on the previous event. Traditionalists threatened to boycott what they called a \"[[Half crown (British coin)|Half Crown]]-nation\".<ref name=\"Strong, p. 401\">Strong, p. 401.</ref> The king merely wore his robes over his uniform as [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter, Gentleman|first=Edward, David|title=Westminster Abbey|year=1987|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|page=[https://archive.org/details/westminsterabbey0000carp/page/89 89]|isbn=0-297-79085-4|url=https://archive.org/details/westminsterabbey0000carp/page/89}}</ref> For this coronation, a number of economising measures were made which would set a precedent followed by future monarchs. The assembly of peers and ceremonial at Westminster Hall involving the presentation of the regalia to the monarch was eliminated. The procession from Westminster Hall to the Abbey on foot was likewise eliminated and in its place, a state procession by coach from [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]] to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.<ref name=\"Strong, p. 401\"/> The coronation banquet after the service proper was also disposed of.\n\nWhen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] was [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|crowned in 1838]], the service followed the pared-down precedent set by her uncle, and the under-rehearsed ceremonial was marred by mistakes and accidents.<ref>Gosling p. 52</ref> The music in the abbey was widely criticised in the press, only one new piece having been written for it and the large choir and orchestra were badly coordinated.<ref>Range, p. 224</ref>\n\nIn the 20th&nbsp;century, liturgical scholars sought to restore the spiritual meaning of the ceremony by rearranging elements with reference to the medieval texts,<ref>Strong, p. 470.</ref> creating a \"complex marriage of innovation and tradition\".<ref>Strong, p. 480.</ref> The greatly increased pageantry of the state processions was intended to emphasise the strength and diversity of the [[British Empire]].<ref>Richards, p. 101</ref>\n\n===Bringing coronations to the people===\n[[File:Coronation Procession of Elizabeth I of England 1559.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Elizabeth I carried from her Coronation in a horse-borne litter, 15 January 1559]]\nThe idea of the need to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the ceremony a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of [[Richard II of England|Richard&nbsp;II]] who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the [[City of London]] by the [[Lord Mayor of London|lord mayor]], [[alderman|aldermen]] and the [[livery companies]], and he was conducted to the [[Tower of London]] where he spent the night in [[vigil]]. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the [[Fountain|public conduit]]s flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in [[Cheapside]], probably to represent the [[New Jerusalem]], where a girl blew [[gold leaf]] over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles&nbsp;II]] in 1661.<ref>Strong, pp. 133\u2013135.</ref> Charles's pageant was watched by [[Samuel Pepys]] who wrote: \"So glorious was the show with gold and silver that we were not able to look at it\". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen<ref>Gosling p. 33</ref> and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from [[Westminster Hall]] to the abbey. For the coronation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;IV]] in 1821, a state procession from [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]] to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.<ref name=\"Strong, p. 401\"/>\n[[File:Coronation of George V 1911 2.jpg|thumb|King George&nbsp;V and Queen Mary seated on the Chairs of Estate in front of the royal box at their coronation in 1911.

Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament.<ref>''The Times'' (London). 29 October 1952. p. 4.</ref> The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20&nbsp;million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.<ref>Strong, pp. 433\u2013435.</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\nThe need to include the various elements of the [[British Empire]] in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and [[governor general|governors-general]] of the [[British Dominion]]s, by then almost completely [[autonomous]], and also by many of the rulers of the [[Indian Princely States]] and the various [[British Protectorate]]s. An [[Imperial Conference]] was held afterwards.<ref>Strong, p. 437.</ref> In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the [[Indian Empire]] along with the traditional banners of the [[Home Nations]]. By 1937, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] had made the dominions fully independent, and the wording of the coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.<ref>Strong, pp. 442\u2013444.</ref>\n\nThus since 1937, the monarch has been simultaneously crowned as sovereign of several independent nations besides the United Kingdom, known since 1953 as the [[Commonwealth realms]]. Elizabeth&nbsp;II was asked, for example: \"Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?\"<ref name=\"oremus\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html |title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in The Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953 |author=Simon Kershaw |year=2002 |publisher=Oremus |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:Westminster-Abbey.JPG|thumb|[[Westminster Abbey]] has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066]]\n\n===Timing===\n{{Further|List of coronations of British monarchs}}\nThe timing of the coronation has varied throughout British history.

Such rights are determined by a special [[Court of Claims (United Kingdom)|Court of Claims]], over which the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of [[Richard II of England|Richard&nbsp;II]]. By the Tudor period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and so [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of the court.<ref name=\"lord-high-steward\"/>\n\nIn 1952, for example, the court accepted the claim of the [[Dean of Westminster]] to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the [[Bishop of Durham|Lord Bishop of Durham]] and the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells]] to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] in his capacity as [[Lord High Steward of Ireland]] to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the [[Queen's Scholar|Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]] to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of \"Vivat!

Amen\". This prayer is the translation of the ancient formula ''Deus tuorum Corona fidelium''.\n\nThe Dean of Westminster picks up the crown and he, the archbishop and several other high-ranking bishops proceed to the Coronation Chair where the crown is handed back to the archbishop, who reverently places it on the monarch's head.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sir George Younghusband|author2=Cyril Davenport|title=The Crown Jewels of England|url=https://archive.org/details/TheCrownJewelsOfEngland|year=1919|publisher=Cassell & Co.|asin=B00086FM86|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheCrownJewelsOfEngland/page/n173 78]}}</ref> At this moment, the king or queen is crowned, and the guests in the abbey cry in unison three times, \"God Save the King/Queen\".

During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon is followed by a rite of [[benediction]] consisting of several prayers.\n\n===Enthronement and homage===\n[[Image:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth&nbsp;I]] wore the crown and held the sceptre and orb at the end of her coronation]]\n\nThe benediction being concluded, the sovereign rises from the Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is seated on the throne, the formula ''Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth\u2026''&nbsp;\u2013 a translation of the Latin formula ''Sta et retine\u2026'', historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns&nbsp; \u2013 is recited.\n\nAfter the enthronement proper, the act of homage takes place: the archbishops and bishops swear their [[fealty]], saying \"I, N., Archbishop [Bishop] of N., will be faithful and true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord [Lady], King [Queen] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and successors according to law.

So help me God.\"<ref name=\"oremus\"/> The clergy pay homage together, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, members of the royal family pay homage individually.

In the coronations following the [[Reformation in England|Reformation]], court musicians, often the [[Master of the King's Music]], were commissioned to compose new [[Musical setting|settings]] for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]]; one of four anthems commissioned from him for [[George II of Great Britain|George&nbsp;II]]'s coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece.

In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|regalia]], it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch.

It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with gold lace.<ref name=\"cox-sovereigns-robes\"/>\n\n'''Worn over the surcoat for the Anointing:'''\n* ''Anointing gown'' \u2013 a simple and austere garment worn during the anointing.

It symbolises the derivation of royal authority from the people.<ref name=\"cox-sovereigns-robes\"/>\n* ''Supertunica'' \u2013 the second robe with which the sovereign is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"cox-sovereigns-robes\"/>\n* ''Robe Royal'' or ''Pallium Regale'' \u2013 the main robe worn during the ceremony and used during the crowning.<ref name=\"oremus\"/> It is a four-square mantle, lined in crimson silk and decorated with silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in the four corners.

It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of [[Roman Emperor]]s.<ref name=\"cox-sovereigns-robes\"/>\n\n====Headwear====\nMale sovereigns up to and including [[George VI]] have traditionally worn a crimson [[cap of maintenance]] for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part of the service. Female sovereigns (and some female consorts) have traditionally worn the [[George IV State Diadem]], first worn by its namesake, [[George IV]]. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with [[St Edward's Crown]] but some have chosen to use other crowns as it weighs 2.23&nbsp;kg (4.9&nbsp;lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter [[Imperial State Crown]].\n\n===Other members of the royal family===\nCertain other members of the royal family wear distinctive robes, most particularly [[queens consort]] (including [[dowagers]]) and [[Princess of the United Kingdom|princesses of the United Kingdom]], all of whom wear purple velvet [[Mantle (clothing)|mantles]] edged with [[ermine]] over their court dresses. Other members of the royal family in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that [[royal duke]]s wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of ermine on the cape and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of the robe.\n\n====Headwear====\n[[Queen consort|Queens consort]] in the 20th century arrived at their coronation bareheaded, and remained so until the point in the service when they were crowned with their own [[Consort crown|crown]]. In the late 17th century and 18th century, queens consort wore [[Mary of Modena's State Crown|Mary of Modena's State Diadem]]. Prior to the 20th century it was not usual for [[Queen dowager|queens dowager]] to attend coronations, but [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] both attended the coronations of George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively, and each wore the crown, minus its arches, with which she had been crowned for the duration of the service.\n\nPrincesses and [[Prince of the United Kingdom|princes of the United Kingdom]] are provided with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-patt\u00e9e alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-patt\u00e9e and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-patt\u00e9e and four strawberry leaves, is used for the children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise be entitled as peers or peeresses.\n\n===Peers===\n[[Image:Earl coronation robes.jpg|thumb|upright|An earl's coronation robes]]\nAll peers and peeresses in attendance are \"expected to wear\" Robes of State, as described below.<ref name=\"Gazette1\">{{London Gazette|issue=39709|page=6351|date=2 December 1952}}</ref> These robes are different to the 'Parliament Robe' (worn on occasion by peers who are members of the House of Lords); all peers summoned to attend wear the Robe of State, regardless of membership of the House of Lords, and peeresses' robes are worn not only by women who are peers in their own right, but also by wives and widows of peers.<ref name=\"CoxRobesPeerage\">{{cite journal|author=Cox, N.| year=1999|title=The Coronation and Parliamentary Robes of the British Peerage|journal=Arma|volume=5|issue=1|pages=289\u2013293}}</ref>{{refn|Peers have two types of robes, the \"Parliamentary Robe\" and the \"Coronation Robe\".

The queen did not attend personally, but she was represented there by the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]].<ref>''The Times'' (London). 2 January 1877. p. 5.</ref> A similar durbar was held on 1&nbsp;January 1903 to celebrate the accession of Edward&nbsp;VII, who was represented by his brother the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]].<ref>''The Times'' (London). 2 January 1903. p. 3.</ref> In 1911, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;V]] also held a durbar which he and his wife [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for a Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, George&nbsp;V was not crowned in India; instead, he wore an [[imperial crown]] as he entered the Durbar. Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the [[Imperial Crown of India]], was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as the decision to move the capital from [[Calcutta]] to Delhi, were announced at the durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by George&nbsp;VI in 1948, a year after [[Indian Independence Act 1947|India gained independence]].<ref>Hilliam, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\n==Kings of Arms==\nAside from kings and queens, the only individuals authorised to wear crowns (as opposed to coronets) are the [[Kings of Arms]], the United Kingdom's senior [[Officer of arms|heraldic officials]].<ref name=\"chambers\">{{Cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People |title=King of Arms |publisher=W & R Chambers |location=Edinburgh |year=1863 |pages=796\u20137 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1oMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA796#PRA3-PA796,M1}}</ref> Like the peers' coronets, these crowns are only put on at the actual moment of the monarch's crowning, after which they are worn for the rest of the service and its subsequent festivities.
