{"title_page": "Henry Singleton (judge)", "text_new": "'''Henry Singleton''' (1682\u20131759) was an Irish politician and  judge,  who is remembered now mainly for his friendship with [[Jonathan Swift]], and for his notable  acts of charity  during the  Great  Irish Famine of 1740-1. Singleton House, his impressive townhouse in Drogheda,  no longer exists.\n\n==Career==\n\nHe was born in [[Drogheda]], one of eleven  children  of Edward  Singleton, Member of Parliament for Drogheda  town and his wife Catherine Newton.  He went to school in [[Drogheda Grammar School]], graduated from the [[University of Dublin]] and was [[called to the Bar]]  in 1707. Like his father he sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as MP  for  [[Drogheda (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Drogheda]] and narrowly missed becoming [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House; he was also [[Recorder (law)|Recorder]] of Drogheda and became [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant-at-law]] in 1726.  He evidently found the office of Serjeant an onerous one, judging by his later pleas  to be appointed to \"a place of greater ease\". It is interesting that he assumed that the workload of a  High Court judge would be  lighter than that  of Serjeant.\n\nIn 1739,  when the office of [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]  fell vacant, Singleton lobbied hard for it, \narguing that his \"fifteen years of faithful service to the Crown\"  surely entitled him to \"a place of more ease, though less profit,  than his present situation\".<ref>Hart, A.

Despite pressure from [[Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet|William Yorke]], his nephew by marriage, who was anxious to succeed him, he was reluctant to step down. Eventually in 1753 he resigned as Chief Justice; the following year he became [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]]  (which was then largely  a [[sinecure]] rather than the senior judicial office which  it became later). He held the Mastership until he died, unmarried, in 1759.\n\n==Heirs==\n[[Image:Mary  Tisdal Reading, by Angelica Kauffmann.jpg|thumb|150px|Mary Singleton  Tisdall, \"la belle Marie\", Singleton's niece and heiress]]\nHis [[will (law)|will]] contains a long list of [[bequests]]  to his surviving sisters, and  to his numerous nephews and nieces.

Mary  married [[Philip Tisdall]], [[Attorney General for Ireland]] from 1760 to 1777,  who was  a dominant figure in the Irish Government for many years.
