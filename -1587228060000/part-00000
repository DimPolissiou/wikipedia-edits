The less successful \"Nights Over Egypt\" (1981), written by [[Dexter Wansel]], charted at R&B #23 in 1982.\n\nAfter the release and failure of their fourth U.S. album, ''On Target'', lead singer Shirley Jones pursued a solo career and had a number 1 R&B hit on Billboard with \"[[Do You Get Enough Love]]\", from her top-ten debut album ''Always in the Mood'' (1986). \"Do You Get Enough Love\" was written by [[Bunny Sigler]] who also produced it with [[Kenny Gamble]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Number One Rhythm & Blues Hits|last=White |first=Adam |last2=Bronson |first2=Fred|authorlink2=Fred Bronson |year=1993 |publisher=Billboard Books:Watson-Guptill Publications, New York |page=368}}</ref> Valorie Jones died on December 2, 2001, in Detroit, Michigan, at the age of 45.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7742025|title=Valorie Jones (1956 - 2001) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> In 2007, Shirley Jones released an album ''Ladies Night Out'' together with [[Jean Carn]] and [[Cherrelle]], on CD and DVD.\n\nBrenda eventually moved to Atlanta, where she sang frequently with her four-piece band, performing both jazz and R&B numbers, including many Jones Girls' tunes.

I would cut records for friends at school of songs off the radio and learned the art of record making long before learning to play music. I would spend countless hours studying the grooves I would cut under the microscope that was attached to the lathe and loved the way music looked, moved and modulated within the thin walls. I might have spent too much time studying music through a microscope because it gave me a completely different outlook on what music is and a totally opposite understanding of it as well. There was something very magical and private when I zoomed into the magnified and secret world of sound in motion. I got to the point that I needed to create and paint my own sounds and colors into the walls of these grooves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/history/history.htm | title=The Wipers' history | author=Greg Sage | accessdate=2008-06-11 | publisher=Zenorecords.com | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515075008/http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/history/history.htm | archivedate=2008-05-15 }}{{Self-published source|date=September 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nInspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]], Sage soon picked up the guitar, and in 1969, at age 17, he played on an eponymous album by professional wrestler [[Larry Pitchford|Beauregarde]].<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\n===Foundation, early years===\nSage founded Wipers in Portland in 1977 along with drummer Henry and bassist Koupal, originally just as a recording project. The plan was to record 15 albums in 10 years without touring or promotion.<ref name=\"mtv\">[http://www.mtv.com/artists/wipers/biography/] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Sage thought that the mystique built from the lack of playing traditional [[rock 'n' roll]] would make people listen to their recordings much deeper with only their imagination to go by. He thought it would be easy to avoid press, shows, pictures and interviews. He looked at music as art rather than entertainment; he thought music was personal to the listener rather than a commodity.\n\nWipers' first single, \"Better Off Dead\", was released in 1978 on Sage's own Trap Records.\n\nSage wanted to make his own recordings and manufacture and run his own label without outside financing. In 1979, Sage approached several Portland punk bands (including [[Neo Boys]], Sado-Nation and Stiphnoyds) and asked them to record singles for his new Trap label.\n\nThe Wipers first album, ''[[Is This Real?]]'', was issued in January 1980 on Park Avenue Records, a label that the band hoped would gain them wider distribution. It was originally recorded on a 4-track in the band's rehearsal studio, but the label insisted that the band use a professional studio.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> Once released, the album gained a [[cult following]], although the band was best known for their live shows around the Portland area.\n\nHenry left to join [[The Rats (American band)|the Rats]], and Koupal moved to Ohio.<ref name=\"mtv\" />\n\nLater in 1980, Park Avenue released the ''[[Alien Boy]]'' EP, consisting of the title track and three demo outtakes.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=YouthofAmerica 33s.ogg\n|title=\"Youth of America\"\n|description=Sample of \"Youth of America\", from the 1981 album ''[[Youth of America]]'' by the Wipers.

''[[Youth of America]]'', released in 1981, contrasted with the short/fast punk songs of the time. According to Sage, this change of pace was a reaction against the punk trend of releasing short songs.<ref name=\"Zeno-Records-Youth-America\">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228050020/http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/disco/youth.htm |title= ''Youth of America'' | archivedate= 2008-02-28|publisher= ZenoRecords.com | url=http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/disco/youth.htm |quote=... at the time of this recording, it was the trend that most songs by bands were very fast and short, to the point that some were doing songs as short as 13 seconds or so.

The band then embarked on their first extensive tour, documented on the ''Wipers Tour 84'' cassette-only live album, which was reissued by [[Enigma Records]] in 1985 as ''[[Wipers Live (album)|Wipers]]''.\n\nIn 1985, Naish was replaced by Steve Plouf, and Enigma issued Sage's first solo album, ''[[Straight Ahead (Greg Sage album)|Straight Ahead]]''.\n\nSigning to Enigma's [[Restless Records]] division, Wipers released 1986's ''[[Land of the Lost (Wipers album)|Land of the Lost]]'', featuring the song \"Let Me Know\", used in the film ''[[River's Edge#Soundtrack|River's Edge]]''. It was followed by ''[[Follow Blind]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Circle (Wipers album)|The Circle]]'' (1988).\n\nIn 1989, drummer [[Travis McNabb]] joined Wipers for a tour, during which Sage announced that the band was ending due to music business frustrations and the loss of their studio space. Sage then relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona]].,<ref name=\"mtv\" /> and Davidson left to move to London. After building a new recording studio in Arizona, Sage released a second solo album, 1991's ''[[Sacrifice (For Love)]]''.<ref name=\"mtv\" />\n\nTwo compilations were released in this era: ''The Best of Wipers and Greg Sage'' in 1990 by Restless, and ''Complete Rarities '78\u2013'90'' in 1993 by Germany's True Believer Records. The latter included the first Wipers 7\", the [[B-side]] of the \"Romeo\" 7\", sampler contributions, and live material from 1986 and 1989.\n\nSage restarted Wipers in 1993, rejoined by Plouf, releasing three additional albums as a duo: ''[[Silver Sail]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Herd (Wipers album)|The Herd]]'' (1996), both on the [[Tim/Kerr]] label, and ''[[Power in One]]'' (1999) on Sage's new Zeno Records. The band became inactive after 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Zeno released ''[[Wipers Box Set]]'', which included the first three Wipers albums, which by that time had been long out-of-print, along with the songs from the ''Alien Boy'' EP and additional previously unreleased material. Jackpot Records and Sage later reissued ''Is This Real?,'' ''Youth of America'' and ''Over the Edge'' on vinyl.\n\n===Post-Wipers===\nHenry formed [[Napalm Beach]] with [[Chris Newman (musician)|Chris Newman]] in 1982. He remains an active musician in Portland, Oregon, and continues to play with Napalm Beach and current band Don't as well as popular Pacific Northwest songwriters like [[Pete Krebs]], [[Morgan Grace]] and Jimmy Boyer.\n\nPlouf operated a vintage goods/Zeno Records store in Portland, appropriately named Zeno Oddities, which closed sometime between 2009 and 2010.\n\nMcNabb formed the Beggars, and went on to work as a session and tour drummer for artists including [[Vigilantes of Love]], Billy Pilgrim, [[Shawn Mullins]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Brendan Benson]], [[Howie Day]], [[Dar Williams]], [[Mandi Perkins]], [[Big & Rich]] and [[Gavin DeGraw]]. McNabb was a member of [[Better Than Ezra]] from 1996 to 2009. In 2007, he joined [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]/[[country music]] act [[Sugarland]].\n\nDavidson (who had previously recorded with the Sage-produced Rancid Vat in 1985) played bass on [[the Jesus And Mary Chain]]'s 1993 EP ''[[Sound of Speed]]''.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nSage later remarked on their initial reception: \"We weren't even really a punk band. See, we were even farther out in left field than the punk movement because we didn't even wish to be classified, and that was kind of a new territory. ...

I would cut records for friends at school of songs off the radio and learned the art of record making long before learning to play music. I would spend countless hours studying the grooves I would cut under the microscope that was attached to the lathe and loved the way music looked, moved and modulated within the thin walls. I might have spent too much time studying music through a microscope because it gave me a completely different outlook on what music is and a totally opposite understanding of it as well. There was something very magical and private when I zoomed into the magnified and secret world of sound in motion. I got to the point that I needed to create and paint my own sounds and colors into the walls of these grooves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/history/history.htm | title=The Wipers' history | author=Greg Sage | accessdate=2008-06-11 | publisher=Zenorecords.com | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515075008/http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/history/history.htm | archivedate=2008-05-15 }}{{Self-published source|date=September 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nInspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]], Sage soon picked up the guitar, and in 1969, at age 17, he played on an eponymous album by professional wrestler [[Larry Pitchford|Beauregarde]].<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\n===Foundation, early years===\nSage founded Wipers in Portland in 1977 along with drummer Henry and bassist Koupal, originally just as a recording project. The plan was to record 15 albums in 10 years without touring or promotion.<ref name=\"mtv\">[http://www.mtv.com/artists/wipers/biography/] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Sage thought that the mystique built from the lack of playing traditional [[rock 'n' roll]] would make people listen to their recordings much deeper with only their imagination to go by. He thought it would be easy to avoid press, shows, pictures and interviews. He looked at music as art rather than entertainment; he thought music was personal to the listener rather than a commodity.\n\nWipers' first single, \"Better Off Dead\", was released in 1978 on Sage's own Trap Records.\n\nSage wanted to make his own recordings and manufacture and run his own label without outside financing. In 1979, Sage approached several Portland punk bands (including [[Neo Boys]], Sado-Nation and Stiphnoyds) and asked them to record singles for his new Trap label.\n\nThe Wipers first album, ''[[Is This Real?]]'', was issued in January 1980 on Park Avenue Records, a label that the band hoped would gain them wider distribution. It was originally recorded on a 4-track in the band's rehearsal studio, but the label insisted that the band use a professional studio.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> Once released, the album gained a [[cult following]], although the band was best known for their live shows around the Portland area.\n\nHenry left to join [[The Rats (American band)|the Rats]], and Koupal moved to Ohio.<ref name=\"mtv\" />\n\nLater in 1980, Park Avenue released the ''[[Alien Boy]]'' EP, consisting of the title track and three demo outtakes.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=YouthofAmerica 33s.ogg\n|title=\"Youth of America\"\n|description=Sample of \"Youth of America\", from the 1981 album ''[[Youth of America]]'' by the Wipers.

''[[Youth of America]]'', released in 1981, contrasted with the short/fast punk songs of the time. According to Sage, this change of pace was a reaction against the punk trend of releasing short songs.<ref name=\"Zeno-Records-Youth-America\">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228050020/http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/disco/youth.htm |title= ''Youth of America'' | archivedate= 2008-02-28|publisher= ZenoRecords.com | url=http://www.zenorecords.com/wipers/disco/youth.htm |quote=... at the time of this recording, it was the trend that most songs by bands were very fast and short, to the point that some were doing songs as short as 13 seconds or so.

The band then embarked on their first extensive tour, documented on the ''Wipers Tour 84'' cassette-only live album, which was reissued by [[Enigma Records]] in 1985 as ''[[Wipers Live (album)|Wipers]]''.\n\nIn 1985, Naish was replaced by Steve Plouf, and Enigma issued Sage's first solo album, ''[[Straight Ahead (Greg Sage album)|Straight Ahead]]''.\n\nSigning to Enigma's [[Restless Records]] division, Wipers released 1986's ''[[Land of the Lost (Wipers album)|Land of the Lost]]'', featuring the song \"Let Me Know\", used in the film ''[[River's Edge#Soundtrack|River's Edge]]''. It was followed by ''[[Follow Blind]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Circle (Wipers album)|The Circle]]'' (1988).\n\nIn 1989, drummer [[Travis McNabb]] joined Wipers for a tour, during which Sage announced that the band was ending due to music business frustrations and the loss of their studio space. Sage then relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona]].,<ref name=\"mtv\" /> and Davidson left to move to London. After building a new recording studio in Arizona, Sage released a second solo album, 1991's ''[[Sacrifice (For Love)]]''.<ref name=\"mtv\" />\n\nTwo compilations were released in this era: ''The Best of Wipers and Greg Sage'' in 1990 by Restless, and ''Complete Rarities '78\u2013'90'' in 1993 by Germany's True Believer Records. The latter included the first Wipers 7\", the [[B-side]] of the \"Romeo\" 7\", sampler contributions, and live material from 1986 and 1989.\n\nSage restarted Wipers in 1993, rejoined by Plouf, releasing three additional albums as a duo: ''[[Silver Sail]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Herd (Wipers album)|The Herd]]'' (1996), both on the [[Tim/Kerr]] label, and ''[[Power in One]]'' (1999) on Sage's new Zeno Records. The band became inactive after 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Zeno released ''[[Wipers Box Set]]'', which included the first three Wipers albums, which by that time had been long out-of-print, along with the songs from the ''Alien Boy'' EP and additional previously unreleased material. Jackpot Records and Sage later reissued ''Is This Real?,'' ''Youth of America'' and ''Over the Edge'' on vinyl.\n\n===Post-Wipers===\nHenry formed [[Napalm Beach]] with [[Chris Newman (musician)|Chris Newman]] in 1982. He remains an active musician in Portland, Oregon, and continues to play with Napalm Beach and current band Don't as well as popular Pacific Northwest songwriters like [[Pete Krebs]], [[Morgan Grace]] and Jimmy Boyer.\n\nPlouf operated a vintage goods/Zeno Records store in Portland, appropriately named Zeno Oddities, which closed sometime between 2009 and 2010.\n\nMcNabb formed the Beggars, and went on to work as a session and tour drummer for artists including [[Vigilantes of Love]], Billy Pilgrim, [[Shawn Mullins]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Brendan Benson]], [[Howie Day]], [[Dar Williams]], [[Mandi Perkins]], [[Big & Rich]] and [[Gavin DeGraw]]. McNabb was a member of [[Better Than Ezra]] from 1996 to 2009. In 2007, he joined [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]/[[country music]] act [[Sugarland]].\n\nDavidson (who had previously recorded with the Sage-produced Rancid Vat in 1985) played bass on [[the Jesus And Mary Chain]]'s 1993 EP ''[[Sound of Speed]]''.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nSage later remarked on their initial reception: \"We weren't even really a punk band. See, we were even farther out in left field than the punk movement because we didn't even wish to be classified, and that was kind of a new territory. ... When we put out ''Is This Real?'' ... it definitely did not fit in; none of our records did.
