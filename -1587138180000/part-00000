In those years, the Commissariat decided to create home [[pedagogical]] technical schools. These technical schools (that involved 1500 teachers) were established in 1927 with the purpose of training teachers with secondary special education.\n\nOn October 1, 1929, in accordance with the Decision of the Board of the Branch of [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of the Azerbaijan SSR dated July 13, 1929, the Azerbaijan Institute of Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was opened. The Institute included home pedagogical technical schools, a former pedagogical faculty, and correspondence methodical courses. Initially, the Institute was only engaged in the retraining of pedagogical personnel, which was conducted through correspondence and short-term courses. The retraining was covered by educators of all categories.\n\nIn 1939, the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was replaced by the Republican Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers.\n\nIn 1972, it was also reorganized into the Azerbaijan Central Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers.

UNEC was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the [[South Caucasus]]. UNEC has 14 faculties, where 18.5 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], [[New York Academy of Sciences]], winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. UNEC is a full member of the [[European University Association]], [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]], University Council of [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] and Eurasian Association of Universities. Foreign students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate coourses at UNEC are approximately 650 out of 18,400 student enrollment overall.\n\nIn 2007, a Library and Information Center and a student Career Center started functioning at UNEC and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year UNEC received the \u201cEuropean quality\u201d award and the   European Club of Rectors and [[European University Association]]. On its Main Building on Istiglaliyyat street, a 24/7 open library is operating since 2018.\n\nThe strategic direction of UNEC development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with [[Bologna Process]], as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rektor/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTOR|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rectorate/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTORATE|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally a part of [[Baku State University]], it became a separate, independent institution in 1934.  Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] changed the name to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after [[Karl Marx]]\" (similar to the naming of the [[Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov]]), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx\".  With the onset of [[World War II]], UNEC was folded into [[Baku State University]]'s Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.\n\nIn 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.\n\n== Derbent branch ==\nThe [[Derbent]] branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:\n\n* [[World economy]]\n* [[Finance]] and credit\n* [[Accounting]], analysis and [[audit]]\n* General Economy\n\nAlong with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2691145.html|title=Official opening of UNEC\u2019s Darband branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ageu-derbent.ru/o_filiale/|title=Derbent Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the Derbent Branch of the Azerbaijan State University of Economics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Zagatala branch ==\nUnder the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]]. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:\n\n* [[Business administration|Business management]]\n* Finance\n* Accounting\n* [[Economy]]\n\nThe first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://salamnews.org/ru/news/read/235908|title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/zagatala-branch/|title=Zagatala Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation ==\nThe Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities.\n\nThus, ASUE cooperates with the [[University of Siegen|Siegen University]] of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled \"Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan\" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2878793.html|title=UNEC launches summer school together with Siegen University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2446509.html|title=The International School of Economics is UNEC\u2019s gateway to the Western Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUNEC was declared the winner of the [[TEMPUS]] IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called \"Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations\". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the [[European Commission]]. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized.

Ali Khan, the protagonist, took his final graduation exams in that building, which is located on one of Baku's most prestigious streets - Independence (Istiglaliyyat), though at the time of the novel, it was called Nikolay Street, named after the Russian czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Nino's school, now Public School No. 132, was located across the street.\n\nCuriously, both [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli|Yusif Vazir (Chamanzaminli)]] (1887-1943), the Core Author of ''Ali and Nino'',<ref>101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4] (2011), pp. 262-333.</ref> as well as Essad Bey / [[Lev Nussimbaum]] (1905-1942) both attended this school. Vazirov attended Baku Realni High School (having transferred in as a refugee from [[Shusha]]) beginning in 1906 and he graduated in 1909.\n\n[[Lev Nussimbaum]] attended Men's Gymnasium No. 2, which at that time (1914-1920) was housed inside Baku Realni. Though Nussimbaum was often absent due to sickness and political unrest, he was enrolled from Junior Preparatory to the beginning of Fourth Grade when he fled the Bolshevik takeover of the Baku government (1920). This school offered classes through Eighth Grade. Documents indicate that Nussimbaum failed his Azerbaijani class in 1919, the only time records exist showing that he had enrolled in Azerbaijani.<ref>Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13.

UNEC was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the [[South Caucasus]]. UNEC has 14 faculties, where 18.5 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], [[New York Academy of Sciences]], winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. UNEC is a full member of the [[European University Association]], [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]], University Council of [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] and Eurasian Association of Universities. Foreign students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate coourses at UNEC are approximately 650 out of 18,400 student enrollment overall. \n\nIn 2007, a Library and Information Center and a student Career Center started functioning at UNEC and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year UNEC received the \u201cEuropean quality\u201d award and the   European Club of Rectors and [[European University Association]]. On its Main Building on Istiglaliyyat street, a 24/7 open library is operating since 2018.  \n\nThe strategic direction of UNEC development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with [[Bologna Process]], as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rektor/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTOR|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rectorate/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTORATE|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>.\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally a part of [[Baku State University]], it became a separate, independent institution in 1934.  Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] changed the name to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after [[Karl Marx]]\" (similar to the naming of the [[Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov]]), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx\".  With the onset of [[World War II]], UNEC was folded into [[Baku State University]]'s Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.\n\nIn 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.\n\n== Derbent branch ==\nThe [[Derbent]] branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:\n\n* [[World economy]]\n* [[Finance]] and credit\n* [[Accounting]], analysis and [[audit]]\n* General Economy\n\nAlong with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2691145.html|title=Official opening of UNEC\u2019s Darband branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ageu-derbent.ru/o_filiale/|title=Derbent Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the Derbent Branch of the Azerbaijan State University of Economics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Zagatala branch ==\nUnder the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]]. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:\n\n* [[Business administration|Business management]]\n* Finance\n* Accounting\n* [[Economy]]\n\nThe first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://salamnews.org/ru/news/read/235908|title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/zagatala-branch/|title=Zagatala Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation ==\nThe Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities. \n\nThus, ASUE cooperates with the [[University of Siegen|Siegen University]] of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled \"Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan\" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2878793.html|title=UNEC launches summer school together with Siegen University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2446509.html|title=The International School of Economics is UNEC\u2019s gateway to the Western Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUNEC was declared the winner of the [[TEMPUS]] IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called \"Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations\". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the [[European Commission]]. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus+]] Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[University of Warwick]] Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ue.poznan.pl/data/upload/articles/20151016/98254f399020401045/informacje-o-uczelni-asue.pdf|title=Azerbaijan State University of Economics|last=|first=|date=|website=Pozna\u0144 University of Economics and Business|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2726274.html|title=\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 UNIVIA, \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University - the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]] (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/en/page/61|title=International cooperation|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French [[University of Montpellier]] in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.haberler.com/unec-s-first-students-to-study-at-university-of-928998/|title=UNEC's First Students To Study At University Of Montpellier|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and Certificates ==\n'''2006''' - Azerbaijan State University of Economics was awarded the \"Golden Fortune\" prize, which was held by the International Academy of Rating Technologies and Sociology.

Ali Khan, the protagonist, took his final graduation exams in that building, which is located on one of Baku's most prestigious streets - Independence (Istiglaliyyat), though at the time of the novel, it was called Nikolay Street, named after the Russian czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Nino's school, now Public School No. 132, was located across the street.\n\nCuriously, both [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli|Yusif Vazir (Chamanzaminli)]] (1887-1943), the Core Author of ''Ali and Nino'',<ref>101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4] (2011), pp. 262-333.</ref> as well as Essad Bey / [[Lev Nussimbaum]] (1905-1942) both attended this school. Vazirov attended Baku Realni High School (having transferred in as a refugee from [[Shusha]]) beginning in 1906 and he graduated in 1909. \n\n[[Lev Nussimbaum]] attended Men's Gymnasium No. 2, which at that time (1914-1920) was housed inside Baku Realni. Though Nussimbaum was often absent due to sickness and political unrest, he was enrolled from Junior Preparatory to the beginning of Fourth Grade when he fled the Bolshevik takeover of the Baku government (1920). This school offered classes through Eighth Grade. Documents indicate that Nussimbaum failed his Azerbaijani class in 1919, the only time records exist showing that he had enrolled in Azerbaijani.<ref>Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13.

Its first graduation was in 1924. So far ASPU has prepared more than 100 thousand teachers. In 1972 the Institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour|Order of the Red Banner of Labor]].\n\nBefore its foundation, an Organizing Committee (Preparatory Commission) was created for the establishment of the institute in late 1920. Fatullah Bey Rzabeyli was appointed the Chairman of the Committee. The members were Habib Bey Mahmudbeyov and Rahim Jafarov. [[Abdulla Shaig]], Muhammed bey Efendiyev, and Sadig Huseynov also took part in the activities of the committee. They also participated in the organization of the one-year pedagogical courses which played a key role in the establishment of the Pedagogical Institute in Azerbaijan and also delivered lectures in these courses.\n\nThe Organizing Committee was to prepare a curriculum for the institute and present it to the Azerbaijani People's State Education Commission, to find qualified personnel and to resolve the issue of teaching aids and construction. The Committee began its work on June 9, 1920.\n\nOn June 13, 1921, the Azerbaijani People's Education Commission approved the first statute of the Pedagogical Institute. The statute defines the structure, duties, and rights of the institution and also specifies the subject disciplines included in the curriculum, as well as the rules of the colloquium, acts of admission and examinations to strengthen the knowledge and control of students.\n[[File:Stmarysbaku.jpg|thumb|317x317px]]\nAccording to the curriculum, students in the first year were supposed to teach the subjects such as mathematics, Mother tongue, the Russian language, literature, music, etc. In the second year, students were divided into specialties and trained in accordance with the relevant subjects. On November 12, 1921, three days before the beginning of the classes the first meeting of the Council of the Institute was held at the Pedagogical Institute and questions were also discussed about the organization of lessons and other important tasks.\n\nIn the first years, the Institute trained teachers in the field of history, philology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as well as theoretical courses and experimental studies in botany, zoology, physiology, chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. The students were educated within the framework of the program of the [[Baku State University|Baku State]] University by such teachers as F. Rasulzade, S. Huseynov, A. A. Amirov, S. Kh. Osinanzade. In this period the most powerful scientific center of the department was the faculty of physiology.\n\nIn 1921 the Department of History and Public Literature was established. The new department was responsible for teaching the humanitarian and special disciplines, philosophy, logic, pedagogy, didactics, political economy, the foundations of the state law and other subjects. From 1925 to 1926 the department was divided into two independent departments: the Department of History and the Department of Philology.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1924 the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan allocated 112 thousand manats for educational, scientific and economic work of the institute. In those years, the Institute's basic library was also enriched. At the time of the library`s creation, there were just 50 books in the Azerbaijani language and 73 books in different languages. A few years later the library fund of German literature was significantly increased from Moscow and other cities. In the academic year 1923-24, there were 2,000 copies in Azerbaijani and 1,000 copies in the Russian language in the library.\n\nFrom 1924-25 school years, the institute began to work with a 4-year curriculum.

Its first graduation was in 1924. So far ASPU has prepared more than 100 thousand teachers. In 1972 the Institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour|Order of the Red Banner of Labor]].\n\nBefore its foundation, an Organizing Committee (Preparatory Commission) was created for the establishment of the institute in late 1920. Fatullah Bey Rzabeyli was appointed the Chairman of the Committee. The members were Habib Bey Mahmudbeyov and Rahim Jafarov. [[Abdulla Shaig]], Muhammed bey Efendiyev, and Sadig Huseynov also took part in the activities of the committee. They also participated in the organization of the one-year pedagogical courses which played a key role in the establishment of the Pedagogical Institute in Azerbaijan and also delivered lectures in these courses.\n\nThe Organizing Committee was to prepare a curriculum for the institute and present it to the Azerbaijani People's State Education Commission, to find qualified personnel and to resolve the issue of teaching aids and construction. The Committee began its work on June 9, 1920.\n\nOn June 13, 1921, the Azerbaijani People's Education Commission approved the first statute of the Pedagogical Institute. The statute defines the structure, duties, and rights of the institution and also specifies the subject disciplines included in the curriculum, as well as the rules of the colloquium, acts of admission and examinations to strengthen the knowledge and control of students.\n[[File:Stmarysbaku.jpg|thumb|317x317px]]\nAccording to the curriculum, students in the first year were supposed to teach the subjects such as mathematics, Mother tongue, the Russian language, literature, music, etc. In the second year, students were divided into specialties and trained in accordance with the relevant subjects. On November 12, 1921, three days before the beginning of the classes the first meeting of the Council of the Institute was held at the Pedagogical Institute and questions were also discussed about the organization of lessons and other important tasks.\n\nIn the first years, the Institute trained teachers in the field of history, philology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as well as theoretical courses and experimental studies in botany, zoology, physiology, chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. The students were educated within the framework of the program of the [[Baku State University|Baku State]] University by such teachers as F. Rasulzade, S. Huseynov, A. A. Amirov, S. Kh. Osinanzade. In this period the most powerful scientific center of the department was the faculty of physiology.\n\nIn 1921 the Department of History and Public Literature was established. The new department was responsible for teaching the humanitarian and special disciplines, philosophy, logic, pedagogy, didactics, political economy, the foundations of the state law and other subjects. From 1925 to 1926 the department was divided into two independent departments: the Department of History and the Department of Philology.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1924 the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan allocated 112 thousand manats for educational, scientific and economic work of the institute. In those years, the Institute's basic library was also enriched. At the time of the library`s creation, there were just 50 books in the Azerbaijani language and 73 books in different languages. A few years later the library fund of German literature was significantly increased from Moscow and other cities. In the academic year 1923-24, there were 2,000 copies in Azerbaijani and 1,000 copies in the Russian language in the library.\n\nFrom 1924-25 school years, the institute began to work with a 4-year curriculum. At that time, 142 students were studying at the university. Students from neighboring countries, such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], etc., also studied at this educational institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijans.com/content_883_en.html|title=State universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Famous graduates ===\n[[Yevda Abramov|Abramov Yevda]] - Azerbaijani statesman, deputy of Milli Majlis (Azerbaijani Parliament).\n\n[[Hamid Arasly]] - Soviet Azerbaijani scientist, literary critic, Doctor of Philology (1954), academician of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan SSR (1968).\n\n[[Ahmad Javad]] - Azerbaijani poet, writer, journalist, author of the words Hymn of Azerbaijan.\n\nBudag Budagov  - Azerbaijani Soviet scientist, geographer, academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR (1989), director of the Institute of Geography of ANAS.\n\nAli Mammadov - Soviet and Azerbaijani arabist, orientalist, translator.\n\nAfat Gurbanov - doctor of philological sciences, professor, corresponding member of ANAS.\n\nIbrahim Ibrahimov - mathematician, academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, professor, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences.\n\n[[Ilyas Afandiyev]] - People's Writer of Azerbaijan (1979).\n\nAvaz Sadig - Azerbaijani Soviet writer.\n\n== Structure of the University ==\nThere are more than 7,000 students studying at the university.
