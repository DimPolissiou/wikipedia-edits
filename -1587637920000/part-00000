There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document. The founding charter of the Priory, dated 1094, is the first known document which is specific to Lancaster.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had given Lancaster and its surrounding region to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. This document also suggests that the monastery had been refounded as a parish church at some point before 1066.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\"/>\n\nLancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>\n[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]\n[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests. A memorial to the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] is located close to the city centre.\n\n[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]\nThe traditional emblem for the [[House of Lancaster]] is a red rose, the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]], which is a white rose. These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]].

The former [[City]] and [[Municipal Borough]] of Lancaster and the [[Morecambe and Heysham|Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham]] along with other authorities merged in 1974 to form the [[City of Lancaster|District of Lancaster]] within the [[shire county]] of Lancashire. This was given [[city status in the United Kingdom]] and Lancaster City Council is the local governing body for the district. Lancaster is an [[unparished area]] and has no separate council. It is divided into wards such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O'Gaunt (named after [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]), [[Scotforth]] East, Scotforth West, [[Skerton]] East, Skerton West, and University and Scotforth Rural.\n\n===Political representation===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Lancaster, Lancs coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Lancaster City Council.]] -->\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nMost of the city lies in the [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The current MP for [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] is [[Cat Smith]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Skerton part of the city lies in the [[Morecambe and Lunesdale]] constituency represented by [[David Morris (Conservative politician)|David Morris]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nBefore [[Brexit]], it was in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] European Parliamentary Constituency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition. At 10 seats, Lancaster has one of the largest Green Party representations in the country.\n\n==Geography==\nLancaster is the most northerly city in Lancashire, lying three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) inland from [[Morecambe Bay]] on the [[River Lune]] (from which it derives its name), and the [[Lancaster Canal]].

There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document. The founding charter of the Priory, dated 1094, is the first known document which is specific to Lancaster.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had given Lancaster and its surrounding region to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. This document also suggests that the monastery had been refounded as a parish church at some point before 1066.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\"/>\n\nLancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>\n[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]\n[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests. A memorial to the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] is located close to the city centre.\n\n[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]\nThe traditional emblem for the [[House of Lancaster]] is a red rose, the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]], which is a white rose. These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]].

The Skerton part of the city lies in the [[Morecambe and Lunesdale]] constituency represented by [[David Morris (Conservative politician)|David Morris]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nBefore [[Brexit]], it was in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] European Parliamentary Constituency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition.

The study of [[women's history]] has been a major scholarly and popular field, with many scholarly books and articles, museum exhibits, and courses in schools and universities.  The roles of women were long ignored in textbooks and popular histories. By the 1960s, women were being presented as successful as male roles.  An early feminist approach underscored their victimization and inferior status at the hands of men. In the 21st century writers have emphasized the distinctive strengths displayed inside the community of women, with special concern for minorities among women.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:Virginia dare stamp.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A stamp honoring [[Virginia Dare]], who in 1587 became the first English child born in what became the United States]]\n{{Main|Colonial history of the United States}}\n\nThe experiences of women during the colonial era varied from colony to colony, but there were some overall patterns.  Most of the British settlers were from England and Wales, with smaller numbers from Scotland and Ireland.  Groups of families settled together in New England, while families tended to settle independently in the Southern colonies. The American colonies absorbed several thousands of Dutch and Swedish settlers. After 1700, most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s\u2014young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.<ref>Herbert Moller, \"Sex Composition and Correlated Culture Patterns of Colonial America,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1945) 2#2 pp. 113\u2013153 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1923515 in JSTOR]</ref> After the 1660s, a steady flow of black slaves arrived, chiefly from the Caribbean.  Food supplies were much more abundant than in Europe, and there was an abundance of fertile land that needed farm families. However, the [[Disease in colonial America|disease environment]] was hostile in the malaria-ridden South, where a large portion of the arrivals died within five years. The American-born children were immune from the fatal forms of malaria.<ref>H. Roy Merrens and George D.

They believed a woman should dedicate herself to rearing God-fearing children to the best of her ability.\n\nThere were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.\nThe New England regional economy grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to heavy immigration, high birth rates, low death rates, and an abundance of inexpensive farmland.<ref>Daniel Scott Smith, \"The Demographic History of Colonial New England,\" ''Journal of Economic History,''  32 (March 1972), 165\u2013183 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117183 in JSTOR]</ref>  The population grew from 3000 in 1630 to 14,000 in 1640, 33,000 in 1660,  68,000 in 1680, and 91,000 in 1700.  Between 1630 and 1643, about 20,000 Puritans arrived, settling mostly near Boston; after 1643 fewer than fifty immigrants a year arrived.  The average size of a completed family 1660\u20131700 was 7.1 children; the birth rate was 49 babies per year per 1000 people, and the death rate was about 22 deaths per year per thousand people.  About 27 percent of the population comprised men between 16 and 60 years old.<ref>Terry L. Anderson and Robert Paul Thomas, \"White Population, Labor Force and Extensive Growth of the New England Economy in the Seventeenth Century, ''Journal of Economic History,'' Vol. 33, No. 3 (Sept 1973), pp. 634\u2013667 at p 647, 651; they use stable population models. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117117 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe benefits of economic growth were widely distributed, with even farm laborers better off at the end of the colonial period. The growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands further west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775; new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring.  The region bordered [[New France]], which used Indian warriors to attack outlying villages. Women were sometimes captured. In the numerous [[French and Indian Wars]] the British government poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay colonial soldiers.  The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade and shipbuilding\u2014and after 1780 in whaling. Combined with a growing urban markets for farm products, these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T.

It was optional and some towns proved reluctant. Northampton, Massachusetts, for example, was a late adopter because it had many rich families who dominated the political and social structures and they did not want to pay taxes to aid poor families. Northampton assessed taxes on all households, rather than only on those with children, and used the funds to support a grammar school to prepare boys for college. Not until after 1800 did Northampton educate girls with public money. In contrast, the town of Sutton, Massachusetts, was diverse in terms of social leadership and religion at an early point in its history. Sutton paid for its schools by means of taxes on households with children only, thereby creating an active constituency in favor of universal education for both boys and girls.<ref>Kathryn Kish Sklar, \"The Schooling of Girls and Changing Community Values in Massachusetts Towns, 1750\u20131820,\"  ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1993 33(4): 511\u2013542</ref>\n\nHistorians point out that reading and writing were different skills in the colonial era.  School taught both, but in places without schools reading was mainly taught to boys and also a few privileged girls. Men handled worldly affairs and needed to read and write. Girls only needed to read (especially religious materials). This educational disparity between reading and writing explains why the colonial women often could read, but could not write so they used an \"X\" to sign their names.<ref>E.

Gutierrez finds a high level of illegitimacy, especially among the Indians who were used as slaves. He finds, \"Aristocrats maintained mistresses and/or sexually exploited to their slaves but rarely admitted to fathering illegitimate children.\"<ref>Ramon A.

She and Rolfe sailed to England in 1616, where she was presented at the court of [[King James I]]; she died soon after. Townsend argues that Pocahontas was not a powerful princess, but just one of many of the chief's daughters. She was assertive, youthful, and athletic; she returns Rolfe's love while also observing the Algonquin practice of constructing alliances through marriage, and she accepts Christianity as complementing her Algonquin religious worldview.<ref>Townsend, ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2004)</ref>  Many leading families in Virginia to this day proudly claim her as an ancestor. There were many tales about her in Virginia and England, reflecting myth, culture, romanticism, colonialism, and historical events as well as narratives of intermarriage, heroic women, and gender and sexuality as metaphors for national, religious, and racial differences.<ref>Gary Dyer, \"The Transatlantic Pocahontas,\" ''Nineteenth-Century Contexts'' (2008) 30#4 pp 301\u2013322.</ref>\n\n==== Cecily  Jordan Farrar ====\n[[Cecily Jordan Farrar]] was an early women settler of colonial [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].  She came to the colony as a child aboard the ''[[Fluyt#Section|Swan]]''  in 1610.  Arriving in the middle of the first Anglo-Powhatan war, she established herself as one of the few female [[ancient planter]]s.  She married [[Samuel Jordan]] sometime before 1620. After Samuel\u2019s death in 1623, Cecily established herself as one of the heads of  household at [[Jordan\u2019s Journey]]. In the same year, Cecily became the defendant in the first [[breach of promise]] lawsuit in English North America when she chose the marriage proposal of [[William Farrar (settler)|William Farrar]] over that of Grivell Pooley (see [[Cecily Jordan v.

Hutchinson herself was summoned to trial late in 1637 and also banished, but allowed to remain under house arrest until the end of winter.  In March 1638, she was again brought before the court and formally excommunicated; she and her children soon joined her husband, who had prepared a home for them in the new colony of Rhode Island, which had been founded less than two years earlier by other dissidents exiled from Massachusetts.<ref>* {{cite book |last=Augur |first=Helen |title=An American Jezebel: The Life of Anne Hutchinson |url=https://archive.org/details/amerjezebell00augu |location=New York |publisher=Brentano's |year=1930}} [https://archive.org/details/amerjezebell00augu online free]</ref>  At nearly 47, In 1660, [[Mary Dyer]], a [[Quaker]] who had been among Hutchinson's followers, was hanged in Massachusetts for repeatedly returning to Massachusetts and proselytizing for Quakerism.<ref>Ruth Talbot Plimpton, ''Mary Dyer: Biography of a Rebel Quaker'' (2009)</ref>\n\n====Slaves====\nIn 1655, [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], who was a slave in Virginia, won her freedom in a lawsuit based on her father's status as a free Englishman (her mother was a slave and her father was her mother's owner), helped by the fact that her father had baptized her as Christian in the Church of England.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYWs-GQDiOkC&pg=PA223 |title=Women in early America: struggle&nbsp;... \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=June 29, 2011|isbn=9781851094295|year=2004|last1=Mays |first1=Dorothy A. }}</ref> However, in 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law stating that any child born in the colony would follow the status of its mother, slave or free.<ref name=\"google1\"/> This was an overturn of a longheld principle of English Common Law, whereby a child's status followed that of the father; it enabled white men who raped slave women to hide the mixed-race children born as a result and removed their responsibility to acknowledge, support, or emancipate those children.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\nWhen Europeans began to arrive in the New World, many indigenous people converted. As a result, religion was less useful as a way to differentiate and skin color became more important. Many elite men had children with slaves. Pregnancy out of wedlock was encouraged among nonwhite women as the children would become workers/slaves. The number of births out of wedlock in Latin America was much higher than in Europe. On the other hand, unmarried white women who had mixed-race children were treated worse than those who had white children. Despite the expectation of men to father mixed-raced children with nonwhite women, rape of a woman by a black man could lead to castration and European women who married indigenous men lost their \"European\" status. As more white women moved to the new colonies, interracial sex became less common since Europeans became concerned with \"racial survival\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in History|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=39\u201345|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n====Witches====\n{{Main|Salem witch trials}}\n[[File:Witchcraft at Salem Village.jpg|thumb|300px|Witchcraft trial at Salem Village (1876 illustration).]]\nIn the small Puritan community of [[Salem Village]], Massachusetts, the [[Salem witch trials]] began in 1692.  They began when a group of girls gathered in the evenings in the home of Reverend Parris to listen to stories told by one of his slaves, Tituba.  They played fortune-telling games, which were strictly forbidden by the Puritans. The girls began acting strangely, leading the Puritan community to suspect that the girls were victims of witchcraft.  The girls named three townswomen as witches \u2013 [[Tituba]], [[Sarah Good]], and [[Sarah Osborne|Sarah Osbourne]]; Tituba confessed to having seen the devil and also stated that there was a coven of witches in the Salem Village area.

One aspect that was drastically changed by the democratic ideals of the Revolution was the roles of women.\n\nThe idea of [[republican motherhood]] was born in this period and reflects the importance of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism as the dominant American ideology]]. Republicanism assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Thus, women had the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.\n\nWhatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disenfranchised and with only the role of mother open to them.\n[[Deborah Sampson]] was the only woman historians know of who fought disguised as a man in the Revolutionary War. In 1782, she disguised herself as a man and joined the 4th Massachusetts Regiment. When her gender was finally discovered she was given an honorable discharge.<ref>Lucy Freeman and Alma H. Bond, ''America's First Woman Warrior: The Courage of Deborah Sampson'' (1992)</ref>  Many women were attached to the Army to help their husbands, and to handle cooking and cleaning. In 1776, Margaret Corbin fired her husband's cannon after he was killed; she was herself severely wounded in the battle. She received a pension from Congress in recognition of her service, making her the first American woman ever to receive a government pension. At the battle of Monmouth in 1778, Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley fired her husband's cannon after he was wounded in battle.

They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with peas and peanuts to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee and it was hard to develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used.

Women over age 50 changed least, insisting that they needed servants and continuing their traditional managerial roles. The next generation, comprising the young wives and mothers during the Civil War, depended much less on black servants, and displayed greater flexibility toward household work. The youngest generation, which matured during the war and Reconstruction, did many of their own domestic chores. Some sought paid jobs outside the household, especially in teaching, which allowed an escape from domestic chores and obligatory marriage.<ref>Jane Turner Censer, \"A Changing World of Work: North Carolina Elite Women, 1865\u20131895,\" ''North Carolina Historical Review,'' (1996) 73#1 pp 28\u201355</ref>\n\n===Settling the Great Plains===\nThe arrival of the railroads in the 1870s open up the [[Great Plains]] for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details.<ref>Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880\u20131940'' (1992).</ref>  During the early years of settlement in the late 19th century, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the farm magazines and (after 1914) by government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', (2005) 25#4 245\u2013258.

They were especially concerned with Prohibition, suffrage, school issues, and public health.  Focusing on the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], a national network of middle-class women who formed local clubs, historian Paige Meltzer puts the women's clubs in the context of the [[Progressive Movement]], arguing that its policies:\n:built on Progressive-era strategies of [[Social housekeeping|municipal housekeeping]]. During the Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify their entrance into community affairs: as \"municipal housekeepers,\" they would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and wellbeing of their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists methodically investigated their community's needs and used their \"maternal\" expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman [[Julia Lathrop]]'s leadership in the [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]]. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.<ref>Paige Meltzer, \"The Pulse and Conscience of America\" The General Federation and Women's Citizenship, 1945\u20131960,\" ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'' (2009), Vol. 30 Issue 3, p52-76.

She was a pioneer social worker, leader of community activists at [[Hull House]] in Chicago, [[public philosopher]], sociologist, author, and spokesperson for suffrage and world peace. Alongside presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, she was the most prominent reformer of the [[Progressive Era]].<ref>John M. Murrin, Paul E. Johnson, and James M. McPherson, ''Liberty, Equality, Power'' (2008) p. 538</ref> She helped turn the nation's attention to issues of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, public health, and world peace. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed the vote to be effective in doing so. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.

By the early 20th century some saw temporary migration to the United States to work as a rite of passage and a time of self-discovery and self-reliance. Most moved permanently to the United States, using the inexpensive railroad system to visit Quebec from time to time. When these women did marry, they had fewer children with longer intervals between children than their Canadian counterparts. Some women never married, and oral accounts suggest that self-reliance and economic independence were important reasons for choosing work over marriage and motherhood. These women conformed to traditional gender ideals in order to retain their 'Canadienne' cultural identity, but they also redefined these roles in ways that provided them increased independence in their roles as wives and mothers.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Florencemae |last=Waldron |title=The Battle Over Female (In)Dependence: Women In New England Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Migrant Communities, 1870\u20131930 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |year=2005 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=158\u2013205 |doi=10.1353/fro.2005.0032 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |first=Florencemae |last=Waldron |title='I've Never Dreamed It Was Necessary To 'Marry!': Women And Work in New England French Canadian Communities, 1870\u20131930 |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |year=2005 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=34\u201364 |url=http://jaeh.press.illinois.edu/24/2/waldron.html }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Midwest===\nMost young urban women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the eighth grade aged around fifteen. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. African-American mothers often chose day labor, usually as domestic servants, because of the flexibility it afforded. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.<ref>Kyle E. Ciani, \"Hidden Laborers: Female Day Workers In Detroit, 1870\u20131920,\" ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 23\u201351</ref>\n\nAcross the region, middle-class society women shaped numerous new and expanded charitable and professional associations, and promoted mother's pensions, and expanded forms of social welfare. Many of the Protestant homemakers were active in the temperance and suffrage movements as well.  In Detroit, the Federation of Women's Clubs (DFWC) promoted a very wide range of activities for civic-minded middle-class women who conformed to traditional gender roles. The Federation argued that safety and health issues were of greatest concern to mothers and could only be solved by improving municipal conditions outside the home. The Federation pressured Detroit officials to upgrade schools, water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to require safe food handling, and traffic safety. However, the membership was divided on going beyond these issues or collaborating with ethnic or groups or labor unions. Its refusal to stretch traditional gender boundaries, gave it a conservative reputation in the working-class. Before the 1930s, the women's affiliates of labor unions were too small and weak to fill the gap.<ref>Jayne Morris-Crowther, \"Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 31\u201357</ref>\n\n===South===\n[[File:Rebecca L.

Born into a wealthy plantation family, she married an active politician, managed his career, and became a political expert. An outspoken feminist, she became a leader of the prohibition and [[woman's suffrage]] movements, endorsed lynching (white Southerners should \"lynch a thousand [black men] a week if it becomes necessary\" to prevent the rape of white women), fought for reform of prisons, and filled leadership roles in many reform organizations. In 1922, she was appointed to the [[U.S. Senate]]. She was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served one day; she was the first woman to serve in the Senate.<ref>David B.

The state legislatures ignored efforts to let women vote in local elections. Georgia not only refused to ratify the Federal [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]], but took pride in being the first to reject it. The Amendment passed nationally and Georgia women gained the right to vote in 1920. However, black women did not vote until federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforced their constitutional rights.<ref>A. Elizabeth Taylor, \"Revival and Development of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Georgia,\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' Winter 1958, Vol. 42 Issue 4, pp 339\u2013354</ref>\n\nThe woman's reform movement flourished in cities; however the South was still heavily rural before 1945. In [[History of Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], women reformers did much to establish the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle-class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics in the name of social issues.<ref>Elizabeth York Enstam,  ''Women and the Creation of Urban Life: Dallas, Texas, 1843\u20131920.'' (1998).</ref>\n\nDuring 1913\u201319, advocates of woman suffrage in Dallas drew on the educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings to the task of political persuasion. The [[Dallas Equal Suffrage Association]] developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.<ref>Elizabeth York Enstam, \"The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association, Political Style, and Popular Culture: Grassroots Strategies of the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1913\u20131919.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 2002 68(4): 817\u2013848.</ref>\n\nBlack women reformers usually operated separately.

Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. The women did not often run for office\u2014that was seen as entangling their purity in the inevitable backroom deals routine in politics.<ref>Robert W.

Wells]] and [[Ada S. McKinley]], Who attracted a national audience, as well as Ella Berry, Ida Dempsey and Jennie Lawrence. By 1930, the Blacks comprised upwards of 1/5 of the Republican vote, and had a growing role in primary elections. For example, the Colored Women's Republican Club of Illinois Show their power in the 1928 primary, when their favorite [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]] outpolled former governor [[Charles S. Deneen]] three to one in the black wards and won the nomination for U.S. Senate. Year after year the white Republican leadership held out the hope of anti-lynching legislation, even though lynching had largely disappeared in most of the South by 1920, and in any case the votes were not there to pass it in Congress.  Loyalty to the Republicans as the \"party of Lincoln\" persisted until the [[New Deal Coalition]] offered more opportunities for patronage and welfare in the mid-1930s. There was a class division as well, as the middle class black women reformers spoken language of utopian promise that did not ring true to the poor uneducated maids and laundry workers, who listened every Sunday to the promises of salvation from their preachers.<ref>Lisa G.

J. Walker Manufacturing Company, Indianapolis, 1911]]\nMost of the [[African-American business history|African-Americans in business]] were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, \"Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.\" Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96.

After gaining suffrage, the political activities of women generally subsided or were absorbed in the main political parties. In the 1920s they paid special attention to such issues as world peace and child welfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/first-wave_feminism::sub::United_States |title=First-wave feminism : United States |publisher=Servinghistory.com |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the National Women's Party (NWP) continued the political fight.. Led by [[Alice Paul]], the group proposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women.<ref>Nancy Woloch,  ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (McGraw-Hill, 2002) p. 246.</ref> But many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood. Carrie Chapman Catt and others established The [[League of Women Voters]] to help women carry out their new responsibilities as voters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sks.sirs.com/cgi-bin/hst-article-display?id=SMD1570H-0-3745&artno=0000272752&type=ART&shfilter=U&key=women%2520rights%2520timeline&title=Women%2527s%2520Rights%2520Timeline&res=Y&ren=Y&gov=Y&lnk=Y&ic=N|title=SIRS|website=sks.sirs.com|access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Roaring Twenties====\n{{main|Roaring Twenties}}\n[[File:Clara Bow Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Clara Bow]], a famous movie actress and \"It Girl\" of the 1920s, represented the new freedom to flaunt sexuality.]]\n\nA generational gap began to form between the \"new\" women of the 1920s and older women.  Prior to the 19th Amendment, feminists commonly thought that women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing that one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own but also families.<ref>Brown, Dorothy M. ''Setting a Course: American Women in the 1920s'' (Twayne Publishers, 1987) p. 33.</ref> The \"new\" woman was less invested in social service than the Progressive generations, and in tune with the capitalistic spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfilment.<ref>Nancy Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (2002). p. 256.</ref>\n\nThe 1920s saw significant change in the lives of working women. World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women.<ref>Alice Kessler-Harris, ''Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' (Oxford University Press, 2003) p. 219.</ref> Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, seventy-five percent of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers. The booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from working-class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.<ref>Kessler-Harris, '' Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' pp 237, 288.</ref>\n\nYoung women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], Havelock Ellis, and Ellen Key. There, thinkers outed that sex was not only central to the human experience but that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires just like men and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.<ref>Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' p. 274.</ref>\n\nThe 1920s saw the emergence of the co-ed, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream middle-class experience, but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, \"Husband and Wife\", \"Motherhood\" and \"The Family as an Economic Unit\". In an increasingly conservative post-war era, it was common for a young woman to attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband.  Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, dating underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the automobile, courtship occurred in a much more private setting. \"Petting\", sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for college students.<ref>Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'', p. 281-3.</ref>\n\nDespite women's increased knowledge of pleasure and sex, the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the \u2018feminine mystique\u2019. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible in order to better their families and their homes.<ref>Ruth Schwartz Cowan, ''Two Washes in the Morning and a Bridge Party at Night: The American Housewife between the Wars'' (1976)  p. 184.</ref>\n\n====Flappers====\nThe \"new woman\" was in fashion throughout the twenties; this meant a woman who rejected the pieties (and often the politics) of the older generation, smoked and drank in public, had casual sex, and embraced consumer culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5117/ |title=The New Woman of the 1920s: Debating Bobbed-Hair |publisher=Historymatters.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Also called \"flappers\", these women wore short skirts (at first just to the ankles, eventually up to the knees) and bobbed hair in a short cut \u2013 like a boy's, but longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1920s-fashion-and-music.com/1920s-Flapper.html |title=1920s Flapper |publisher=1920s-fashion-and-music.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Just as the flapper rejected the long hair popular in earlier years, she also discarded Victorian fashions, especially the corset, which accentuated women's curves.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/mmh/clash/NewWoman/Subnarratives/the%20flapper.htm |title=The Flapper |publisher=Ehistory.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Flappers preferred to be slender, although it sometimes meant dieting or binding their breasts and wearing restrictive undergarments to appear thin, flat-chested, and long-limbed.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/> Cultivating a flapper image and adhering to modern beauty standards also involved purchasing and applying cosmetics, which had not often been done previously by women other than prostitutes.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/> These women further pushed the boundaries of what was considered proper for a woman by their public activities; swearing, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol (illegal from 1920 until 1933), dancing, and dating.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/>\n\n====Firsts====\nWomen achieved many groundbreaking firsts in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Italian-American media disapproved. It demanded the holding of the line regarding traditional gender roles in which men controlled their families.  Many traditional patriarchal values prevailed among Southern European male immigrants, although some practices like dowry were left behind in Europe. The community spokesman Were shocked that the image of a woman with a secret ballot. They ridiculed flappers and proclaimed that feminism was immoral. They idealizes an old male model of Italian womanhood. Mussolini was popular, and when he expanded the electorate to include some women voting at the local level, the Italian American editorialists went along, arguing that the true Italian woman was, above all, a mother and a wife and, therefore, would be reliable as a voter on local matters. Feminist organizations in Italy were ignored, as the editors purposely associated emancipation with Americanism and transformed the debate over women's rights into a defense of the Italian-American community to set its own boundaries and rules.<ref>B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Deschamps, \"The Italian-American Press and the \"Woman Question\", 1915\u20131930,\" ''Studi Emigrazione'' (June 2003) 40#150, pp 303\u2013314.</ref>\n\n=== Great Depression of 1930s ===\nIn 1932, [[Hattie Caraway]] of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000138 |title=CARAWAY, Hattie Wyatt \u2013 Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, in 1932 [[Amelia Earhart]] became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, taking her journey on the 5th anniversary of Lindbergh's solo Atlantic flight .<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliaearhart.com/about/achievements.html |title=The Official Website of Amelia Earhart |publisher=Ameliaearhart.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> She was awarded the National Geographic Society's gold medal from President Herbert Hoover, and Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Later in 1932 she became the first woman to fly solo nonstop coast to coast, and set the women's nonstop transcontinental speed record, flying 2,447.8&nbsp;miles in 19 hours 5 minutes.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> In 1935, she became the first person to solo the 2,408-mile distance across the Pacific between Honolulu and Oakland, California; this was also the first flight where a civilian aircraft carried a two-way radio.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Still later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo nonstop from Mexico City to Newark.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> In 1937, Amelia Earhart began a flight around the world but vanished during it; her remains, effects, and plane have never been found.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> The first woman to fly solo around the world and return home safely was the American amateur pilot [[Jerrie Mock]], who did so in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/jerrie-mock-record-breaking-american-female-pilot.htm |title=Jerrie Mock: Record-Breaking American Female Pilot |publisher=History Net |date= June 12, 2006|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> In 1933, [[Frances Perkins]] was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as his Secretary of Labor, making her the first woman to hold a job in a Presidential cabinet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USARperkins.htm |title=Frances Perkins |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |date=May 14, 1965 |accessdate=February 27, 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917032306/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USARperkins.htm |archivedate=September 17, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nHowever, women also faced many challenges during this time.

In relief programs, they were eligible for jobs only if they were the breadwinner in the family. Nevertheless, relief agencies did find jobs for women. The WPA employed about 500,000. The largest number, 295,000,  worked on sewing projects, producing 300 million items of clothing and mattresses for people on relief and for public institutions such as orphanages. Many other women worked in school lunch programs.<ref>Martha Swain, '\"The Forgotten Woman': Ellen S.

She tried to involve women at the local level, but she feuded with her counterpart Mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]], and had little impact on policy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin & Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfv-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA324|year=1994|pages=323\u201324|isbn=9781476750576}}</ref>  Historian Alan Brinkley states:\n:Nor did the New Deal make much more than a symbolic effort to address problems of gender equality....New Deal programs (even those designed by New Deal women) continued most mostly to reflect traditional assumptions about women's roles and made few gestures toward the aspirations of women who sought economic independence and professional opportunities.

Women factory workers embodied the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" model.]]\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, 12 million women were already working (making up one quarter of the workforce), and by the end of the war, the number was up to 18 million (one third of the workforce).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/pwro/collection/website/rosie.htm |title=Rosie the Riveter: Women Working During World War II |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Eventually 3 million women worked in war plants, but the majority of women who worked during World War II worked in traditionally female occupations, like the service sector.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> During this time, Government propaganda calling on women to enter the workforce during the emergency popularized the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" image Of women assuming male roles.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nStandlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the \"home\" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the \"home front\". Meanwhile, the public sphere\u2014the male domain\u2014was redefined as the international stage of military action.<ref>Alecea Standlee, \"Shifting Spheres: Gender, Labor and the Construction of National Identity in U.S. Propaganda during the Second World War,\" ''Minerva Journal of Women & War'' Spring 2010, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 43\u201362</ref>\n\n====Employment====\nWartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor for women, as young-able bodied men were sent overseas and war time manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\">{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan |date=1982 |title=Home Front and Beyond: American Women in the 1940s |url=https://archive.org/details/homefrontbeyonda00hartrich|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=Twayne Publishers |page= |isbn=}}</ref> This was catalyzed by the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" phenomenon.\n\nThe composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed considerably over the course of the war. One in every ten married women entered the labor force during the war, and they represented more than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the nation's history there were more married women than single women in the female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women were actually employed at some time during that year at the height of wartime production.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/> In the same year the unemployment rate hit an all-time historical low of 1.2%.<ref>Tassava, Christopher. [http://eh.net/?s=tassava \"The American Economy during World War II\"]. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. February 10, 2008. URL http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/</ref>\n\nAccording to Hartmann (1982), the women who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time suggests that financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice as likely to seek jobs.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/>\n\nFundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as \"men's work;\" however, the work women did was typically catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation By Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatwork00ruth|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=}}</ref> For example, in a [[Sperry Gyroscope Company|Sperry Corporation]] recruitment pamphlet the company stated, \"Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press.\" A [[Ford Motor Company]] at [[Willow Run]] bomber plant publication proclaimed, \"The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters.\" One manager was even stated saying, \"Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles and darning needs all their lives?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation by Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatwork00ruth |location=Urbana |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=0252013522 }}</ref> In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.\n\nFollowing the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]] (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant) worker in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]] confessed, \"I will gladly get back into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all my life. It was just to help out during the war.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kenney |first=Dave |date=2005 |title=Minnesota at Work |url= |location=St. Paul |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Other women were laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not lose their seniority due to the war.\n\nBy the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not return. This left women to take up sole responsibility of the household and provide economically for the family.\n\n====Black women====\nBefore the war most black women had been farm laborers in the South or domestics in Southern towns or Northern cities.<ref>Maureen Honey ''Bitter Fruit: African American Women in World War II'' (1999).</ref> Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these black women fought a \"[[Double V campaign]]\" \u2014fighting against the Axis abroad and against restrictive hiring practices at home. Their efforts redefined citizenship, equating their patriotism with war work, and seeking equal employment opportunities, government entitlements, and better working conditions as conditions appropriate for full citizens.<ref>Megan Taylor Shockley, 'Working For Democracy: Working-Class African-American Women, Citizenship, and Civil Rights in Detroit, 1940\u20131954,' ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2003), 29:125\u2013157.</ref> In the South, black women worked in segregated jobs; in the West and most of the North, they were integrated. However, [[wildcat strike]]s erupted in Detroit, Baltimore, and [[Evansville, Indiana]] where white migrants from the South refused to work alongside black women.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984), pp. 128\u20139</ref><ref>Daniel Kryder, ''Divided Arsenal: Race and the American State During World War II'' (2000), pp. 113\u201329</ref>\n\n===Nursing===\n\nNursing became a highly prestigious occupation for young women. A majority of female civilian nurses volunteered for the [[Nurse Corps (United States Army)|Army Nurse Corps]] or the [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy Nurse Corps]]. These women automatically became officers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.med-dept.com/anc.php |title=The Army Nurse Corps |access-date=March 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223023548/http://med-dept.com/anc.php |archive-date=February 23, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Teenaged girls enlisted in the [[Cadet Nurse Corps]].

Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also created rubber band balls, which they contributed to the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.\n\nThe [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying a warplane had always been a male role. No American women flew warplanes in combat.<ref>Molly Merryman, ''Clipped Wings: The Rise and Fall of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS) of World War II'' (2001)</ref>\n\n===Baby boom===\nMarriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who had postponed marriage. The birth rate started shooting up in 1941, paused in 1944\u201345 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the \"[[Baby Boom]].\"\n\nIn a New Deal-like move, the federal government set up the \"EMIC\" program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant.\n\nHousing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little housing had been built in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] years, so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1949, when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand. (After 1944, much of the new housing was supported by the [[G.I. Bill]].)\n\nFederal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range terms, divorce rates changed little.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984) pp 88\u201390.</ref>\n\n===Housewives===\n[[File:Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum July 2015 44 (World War II American home front diorama).jpg|thumb|A World War II American home front diorama, depicting a woman and her daughter, at the [[Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum]]]]\n\nJuggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service, and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.\n\nStress came when sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fianc\u00e9s were drafted and sent to faraway training camps, preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training camps.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984) pp 187\u2013212.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service. However the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the number in 1944, leaving 13% who lost or quit their jobs. Many women working in machinery factories and more were taken out of the work force. Many of these former factory workers found other work at kitchens, being teachers, etc.\n\n===Military service===\nFurthermore, during World War II 350,000 women served in the military, as [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WACS]], [[WAVES]], [[SPARS]], Marines and nurses.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, \"Servicewomen of World War II.\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' 16.2 (1990): 251\u2013270.</ref> More than 60,000 Army nurses served stateside and overseas during World War II; 67 Army nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines in 1942 and were held as POWs for over two and a half years.<ref name=\"womensmemorial.org\"/> More than 14,000 Navy nurses served stateside, overseas on hospital ships, and as flight nurses during the war.<ref name=\"womensmemorial.org\"/> Five Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese on the island of Guam and held as POWs for five months before being exchanged; a second group of eleven Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines and held for 37 months.<ref name=\"womensmemorial.org\"/>\n\nOver 150,000 American women served in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) during World War II; the Corps was formed in 1942.<ref name=\"history.army.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/wac/wac.htm |title=The Women's Army Corps |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Many Army WACs computed the velocity of bullets, measured bomb fragments, mixed gunpowder, and loaded shells.<ref name=\"history.army.mil\"/> Others worked as draftswomen, mechanics, and electricians, and some received training in ordnance engineering.<ref name=\"history.army.mil\"/> Later in the war, women were trained to replace men as radio operators on U.S. Army hospital ships.<ref name=\"history.army.mil\"/> The \"Larkspur\", the \"Charles A.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, parallel with the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements]], women with more radical ideas about feminist goals began to organize. In her work, ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967\u20131975'', historian [[Alice Echols]] gives a thorough description of the short-lived movement. The radical feminists were after not only the end of female oppression by men but, as Echols notes, \"They also fought for safe, effective, accessible contraception; the repeal of all abortion laws; the creation of high-quality, community-controlled child-care centers; and an end to the media\u2019s objectification of women.<ref name=Echols /> \"\n\nSmall protests and signs of a larger support for radical feminism became more cohesive during the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) June 1967 National Convention in Ann Arbor. The \"Women\u2019s Liberation Workshop\" denounced sexual inequality and stated, \"As we analyze the position of women in capitalist society and especially the United States we find that women are in a colonial relationship to men and we recognize ourselves as part of the Third World.\"<ref name=Echols /> Co-written by Jane Addams, one of the most prominent women in SDS, they argued that women's place within SDS was subordinate and revolution could not succeed without women's liberation.<ref name=Echols />\n\nSDS women, including [[Susan Stern]] of the Weathermen, and women from the Old Left, including [[Clara Fraser]] and Gloria Martin, came together to found [http://historylink.org/File/2152 Radical Women] in Seattle in November 1967. [[Radical Women]] identified as socialist feminist and described its political views in \"The Radical Women Manifesto.\" The group called for multi-issue struggle around issues of sex, race and class and defended lesbian/gay rights. Radical Women celebrated its [http://www.seattlestar.net/2017/09/radical-women-celebrate-a-half-century-of-hell-raising/ 50th anniversary of activism in 2017.] (There is no relationship between Radical Women and the short-lived group known as New York Radical Women.)\n\nWhile radical feminists agreed that a separate movement for them was needed, how that movement looked and its ultimate goals caused much divide. They questioned whether they should include men within their movement, whether they should focus on issues of war, race and class, and who or what it was they were exactly rallying against. There were also issues concerning African American women within the movement; while the radical feminists felt gender to be the greatest issue, African American women were also very much concerned with racism and many found that to be where oppression was most domineering. Despite being inspired by the black power movement, radical feminists had difficulty figuring out a place for race within their gender-centric movement. They were also divided over the place of lesbianism in the movement.<ref name=Echols />\n\nNotable radical feminist groups included [[Redstockings]], founded in 1969. The group focused on power dynamics in gender and promoted consciousness-raising and distributed movement literature for free. [[Cell 16]], founded in 1968, was a much more militant group arguing that women were conditioned by their sex-roles. [[The Feminists]], founded by [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] in 1968, claimed women were complicit in their oppression and needed to shed conventional gender roles. [[New York Radical Feminists]], founded in 1969, also found maleness to be the greater issue than power roles. They were interested in building a larger movement through mass numbers in New York City.<ref name=Echols />\n\nEchols describes the movement's end: \n\"Radical feminism remained the hegemonic tendency within the women\u2019s liberation movement until 1973 when cultural feminism began to cohere and challenge its dominance. After 1975, a year of internecine conflicts between radical and cultural feminists, cultural feminism eclipsed radical feminism as the dominant tendency within the women\u2019s liberation movement, and, as a consequence, liberal feminism became the recognized voice of the women\u2019s movement.\"<ref name=Echols />\nThe end of the counterculture movements and the government's observation of the movement also contributed to its end. The radical feminist movement demonstrated that Second-wave feminism was diverse in its goals, but also divided within itself. Echols notes, \"To many women, liberal feminism\u2019s considerably more modest goal of bringing women into the mainstream seemed more palatable, not to mention more realistic, than the radical feminist project of fundamentally reconstructing private and public life.\"<ref name=Echols /> She also states that despite the fact that younger generations don't often see this movement as relevant, it is because feminist movements during this time actually did make significant changes.<ref name=Echols /><ref name=Echols>{{cite book|last=Echols|first=Alice|title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967\u20131975|url=https://archive.org/details/daringtobebadrad0000echo|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota|isbn=978-0816617876}}</ref>\n\n===Abortion===\nOne of the most controversial developments in American women's lives has been the legalization of abortion.

It coordinated efforts across the South to tell the story of the women on the Confederate homefront, while the male historians spent their time with battles and generals. The women emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They reported that when all the men left for war, the women took command, found ersatz and substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced danger without having menfolk in the traditional role of their protectors.<ref>Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865\u20131913'' (1985) p 30</ref> Historian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] argues that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:\n{{quote|UDC leaders were determined to assert women's cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region's past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.<ref>Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, \"'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique.\" ''Journal of American History'' (1998): 439\u2013465 at p 450.

Breakthroughs began in the late 1960s, as increasing numbers of women entered graduate schools, wrote seminar papers that became journal articles, and finished dissertations that became published books. By the 1970s, major publishers were eager to have a few titles on women in their list, and journal editors were equally receptive.<ref>Bonnie G.

An important development is to integrate women into the history of race and slavery. A pioneer effort was [[Deborah Gray White]]'s '''Ar'n't I a Woman? Female Slaves in the Plantation South'' (1985), which helped to open up analysis of race, slavery, abolitionism and feminism, as well as resistance, power, and activism, and themes of violence, sexualities, and the body.<ref>Jessica Millward, \"More History Than Myth: African American Women's History Since the Publication of 'Ar'n't I a Woman?'\" ''Journal of Women's History,'' Summer 2007, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp 161\u2013167</ref>  A major trend in recent years has been to emphasize a global perspective.<ref>Mary E.

The study of [[women's history]] has been a major scholarly and popular field, with many scholarly books and articles, museum exhibits, and courses in schools and universities.  The roles of women were long ignored in textbooks and popular histories. By the 1960s, women were being presented as successful as male roles.  An early feminist approach underscored their victimization and inferior status at the hands of men. In the 21st century writers have emphasized the distinctive strengths displayed inside the community of women, with special concern for minorities among women.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:Virginia dare stamp.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A stamp honoring [[Virginia Dare]], who in 1587 became the first English child born in what became the United States]]\n{{Main|Colonial history of the United States}}\n\nThe experiences of women during the colonial era varied from colony to colony, but there were some overall patterns.  Most of the British settlers were from England and Wales, with smaller numbers from Scotland and Ireland.  Groups of families settled together in New England, while families tended to settle independently in the Southern colonies. The American colonies absorbed several thousands of Dutch and Swedish settlers. After 1700, most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s\u2014young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.<ref>Herbert Moller, \"Sex Composition and Correlated Culture Patterns of Colonial America,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1945) 2#2 pp. 113\u2013153 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1923515 in JSTOR]</ref> After the 1660s, a steady flow of black slaves arrived, chiefly from the Caribbean.  Food supplies were much more abundant than in Europe, and there was an abundance of fertile land that needed farm families. However, the [[Disease in colonial America|disease environment]] was hostile in the malaria-ridden South, where a large portion of the arrivals died within five years. The American-born children were immune from the fatal forms of malaria.<ref>H. Roy Merrens and George D. Terry, \"Dying in Paradise: Malaria, Mortality, and the Perceptual Environment in Colonial SouthCarolina,\" ''Journal of Southern History'' (1984) 50: 533\u201350,</ref>\n\nThe first English people to arrive in America were the members of the [[Roanoke Colony]] who came to North Carolina in July 1587, with 17 women, 91 men, and 9 boys as the founding colonists. On August 18, 1587, [[Virginia Dare]] was born; she was the first English child born in the territory of the United States. Her mother was [[Eleanor Dare]], the daughter of John White, governor of the Roanoke colony.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiadare.com/About-Us/The-Virginia-Dare-Story.aspx |title=The Virginia Dare Story |publisher=Virginia Dare |accessdate=June 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423005113/http://www.virginiadare.com/About-Us/The-Virginia-Dare-Story.aspx |archivedate=April 23, 2015  }}</ref>\nIt is not known what happened to the members of the Roanoke colony; however, it is likely that they were attacked by Native Americans, and those not killed were assimilated into the local tribes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Thomas Powell|title=Grenville and the Lost Colony of Roanoke: The First English Colony of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R31xVVqI-jEC&pg=PA270|year= 2011|publisher=Troubador|page=270|isbn=9781848765962}}</ref>\n[[File:Latrine 17thCentury.jpg|thumb|Women's work in the 17thCentury, carrying a communal latrine]]\n\n===Virginia===\nJamestown, the first English settlement in America, was established in 1607 in what is now Virginia.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1127896220070513 | agency=Reuters | title=FACTBOX-Jamestown, first English settlement in no America | date=May 13, 2007}}</ref>  The first Africans since those in Lucas Vasquez de Allyon's unsuccessful colony in 1526\u20131527 were brought to Jamestown in 1619.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScXpRj6su8EC&pg=PA51 |title=Voices of a People's History of the&nbsp;... \u2013 Google Books |date= November 1, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2011|isbn=9781583229163|last1=Zinn |first1=Howard |last2=Arnove |first2=Anthony }}</ref> At first they came from the Caribbean, and there were twenty of them, including three women.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"nwhm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/africanamerican/index.html |title=Claiming Their Citizenship: African American Women From 1624\u20132009 |publisher=Nwhm.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Virginia_s_First_Africans|title=Virginia's First Africans|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|access-date=}}</ref> At first they were treated as indentured servants until the 1654 case of ''[[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]] v.

They believed a woman should dedicate herself to rearing God-fearing children to the best of her ability.\n\nThere were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.\nThe New England regional economy grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to heavy immigration, high birth rates, low death rates, and an abundance of inexpensive farmland.<ref>Daniel Scott Smith, \"The Demographic History of Colonial New England,\" ''Journal of Economic History,''  32 (March 1972), 165\u2013183 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117183 in JSTOR]</ref>  The population grew from 3000 in 1630 to 14,000 in 1640, 33,000 in 1660,  68,000 in 1680, and 91,000 in 1700.  Between 1630 and 1643, about 20,000 Puritans arrived, settling mostly near Boston; after 1643 fewer than fifty immigrants a year arrived.  The average size of a completed family 1660\u20131700 was 7.1 children; the birth rate was 49 babies per year per 1000 people, and the death rate was about 22 deaths per year per thousand people.  About 27 percent of the population comprised men between 16 and 60 years old.<ref>Terry L. Anderson and Robert Paul Thomas, \"White Population, Labor Force and Extensive Growth of the New England Economy in the Seventeenth Century, ''Journal of Economic History,'' Vol. 33, No. 3 (Sept 1973), pp. 634\u2013667 at p 647, 651; they use stable population models. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117117 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe benefits of economic growth were widely distributed, with even farm laborers better off at the end of the colonial period. The growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands further west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775; new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring.  The region bordered [[New France]], which used Indian warriors to attack outlying villages. Women were sometimes captured. In the numerous [[French and Indian Wars]] the British government poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay colonial soldiers.  The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade and shipbuilding\u2014and after 1780 in whaling. Combined with a growing urban markets for farm products, these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T. Main, \"The Red Queen in New England?,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' (1999) 56#1 pp 121\u201350 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674597 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n====Schooling====\nTax-supported schooling for girls began as early as 1767 in New England. It was optional and some towns proved reluctant. Northampton, Massachusetts, for example, was a late adopter because it had many rich families who dominated the political and social structures and they did not want to pay taxes to aid poor families. Northampton assessed taxes on all households, rather than only on those with children, and used the funds to support a grammar school to prepare boys for college. Not until after 1800 did Northampton educate girls with public money. In contrast, the town of Sutton, Massachusetts, was diverse in terms of social leadership and religion at an early point in its history. Sutton paid for its schools by means of taxes on households with children only, thereby creating an active constituency in favor of universal education for both boys and girls.<ref>Kathryn Kish Sklar, \"The Schooling of Girls and Changing Community Values in Massachusetts Towns, 1750\u20131820,\"  ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1993 33(4): 511\u2013542</ref>\n\nHistorians point out that reading and writing were different skills in the colonial era.  School taught both, but in places without schools reading was mainly taught to boys and also a few privileged girls. Men handled worldly affairs and needed to read and write. Girls only needed to read (especially religious materials). This educational disparity between reading and writing explains why the colonial women often could read, but could not write so they used an \"X\" to sign their names.<ref>E. Jennifer Monaghan, \"Literacy Instruction and Gender in Colonial New England,\" ''American Quarterly'' 1988 40(1): 18\u201341 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713140 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Hispanic New Mexico===\nHispanic women played a central role in traditional family life in the Spanish colonies of New Mexico; their descendants comprise a large element in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Gutierrez finds a high level of illegitimacy, especially among the Indians who were used as slaves. He finds, \"Aristocrats maintained mistresses and/or sexually exploited to their slaves but rarely admitted to fathering illegitimate children.\"<ref>Ramon A. Gutierrez, ''When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away: Marriage, Sexuality, and Power in New Mexico, 1500\u20131846'' (1991) p 199</ref>\n\n===Colonial personalities and activities===\n[[File:Pocahontas 1883.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pocahontas]] (1595\u20131615) of Virginia]]\n\n====Pocahontas====\nThe American Indian woman has been seen as a symbolic paradox. Depending on the perspective, she has been viewed as either the civilized princess or the destructive squaw.  A highly favorable image has surrounded [[Pocahontas]], the daughter of the Native American [[chief Powhatan]] in Virginia.<ref>Camilla Townsend, ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2004)</ref> [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] himself said she saved him from being clubbed to death by her father in 1607.  She was taken hostage by the colonists in 1612, when she was seventeen. She converted to Christianity and married planter [[John Rolfe]] in 1614. It was the first recorded [[interracial marriage]] in American history.<ref name=jimcrowmuseum>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may10/index.htm|title=Ferris University, Jim Crow Museum, Question of the Month|date=May 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526232807/http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may10/index.htm|archive-date=May 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> This marriage brought a peace between the colonists and the Indians. She and Rolfe sailed to England in 1616, where she was presented at the court of [[King James I]]; she died soon after. Townsend argues that Pocahontas was not a powerful princess, but just one of many of the chief's daughters. She was assertive, youthful, and athletic; she returns Rolfe's love while also observing the Algonquin practice of constructing alliances through marriage, and she accepts Christianity as complementing her Algonquin religious worldview.<ref>Townsend, ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2004)</ref>  Many leading families in Virginia to this day proudly claim her as an ancestor. There were many tales about her in Virginia and England, reflecting myth, culture, romanticism, colonialism, and historical events as well as narratives of intermarriage, heroic women, and gender and sexuality as metaphors for national, religious, and racial differences.<ref>Gary Dyer, \"The Transatlantic Pocahontas,\" ''Nineteenth-Century Contexts'' (2008) 30#4 pp 301\u2013322.</ref>\n\n==== Cecily  Jordan Farrar ====\n[[Cecily Jordan Farrar]] was an early women settler of colonial [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].  She came to the colony as a child aboard the ''[[Fluyt#Section|Swan]]''  in 1610.  Arriving in the middle of the first Anglo-Powhatan war, she established herself as one of the few female [[ancient planter]]s.  She married [[Samuel Jordan]] sometime before 1620. After Samuel\u2019s death in 1623, Cecily established herself as one of the heads of  household at [[Jordan\u2019s Journey]]. In the same year, Cecily became the defendant in the first [[breach of promise]] lawsuit in English North America when she chose the marriage proposal of [[William Farrar (settler)|William Farrar]] over that of Grivell Pooley (see [[Cecily Jordan v.

On the other hand, unmarried white women who had mixed-race children were treated worse than those who had white children. Despite the expectation of men to father mixed-raced children with nonwhite women, rape of a woman by a black man could lead to castration and European women who married indigenous men lost their \"European\" status.

They played fortune-telling games, which were strictly forbidden by the Puritans. The girls began acting strangely, leading the Puritan community to suspect that the girls were victims of witchcraft.

One aspect that was drastically changed by the democratic ideals of the Revolution was the roles of women.\n\nThe idea of [[republican motherhood]] was born in this period and reflects the importance of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism as the dominant American ideology]]. Republicanism assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Thus, women had the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.\n\nWhatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disenfranchised and with only the role of mother open to them.\n[[Deborah Sampson]] was the only woman historians know of who fought disguised as a man in the Revolutionary War. In 1782, she disguised herself as a man and joined the 4th Massachusetts Regiment. When her gender was finally discovered she was given an honorable discharge.<ref>Lucy Freeman and Alma H. Bond, ''America's First Woman Warrior: The Courage of Deborah Sampson'' (1992)</ref>  Many women were attached to the Army to help their husbands, and to handle cooking and cleaning. In 1776, Margaret Corbin fired her husband's cannon after he was killed; she was herself severely wounded in the battle. She received a pension from Congress in recognition of her service, making her the first American woman ever to receive a government pension. At the battle of Monmouth in 1778, Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley fired her husband's cannon after he was wounded in battle. Her story morphed into the \"Molly Pitcher\" legend.<ref>[[Linda Grant DePauw]], \"Women in combat: The revolutionary war experience.\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' 7.2 (1981): 209\u2013226.

They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry.  Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties.  They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.<ref>Ginette Aley, \"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s\u20131830s,\" ''Ohio History,'' (2007) 114#1 pp 28\u201345, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ohh/summary/v114/114.aley.html online]</ref>\n\n===Cult of Domesticity===\nThe \"[[Cult of Domesticity]]\" was a new ideal of womanhood that emerged at this time.<ref name=\"library.csi.cuny.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/386/truewoman.html |title=True Womanhood |publisher=Library.csi.cuny.edu |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616073839/http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/386/truewoman.html |archivedate=June 16, 2011  }}</ref> This ideal rose from the reality that a 19th-century middle-class family did not have to make what it needed in order to survive, as previous families had to, and therefore men could now work in jobs that produced goods or services while their wives and children stayed at home.<ref name=\"library.csi.cuny.edu\"/> The ideal woman became one who stayed at home and taught children how to be proper citizens.<ref name=\"library.csi.cuny.edu\"/> ''[[American Cookery]]'' written in 1796 by [[Amelia Simmons]], was the first published cookbook written by an American.<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri054.html |title=A First American Cookbook (Imagination): American Treasures of the Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> It was popular and was published in many editions.\n\n\nThe culture of honor in the antebellum South was linked to women's social status and Southern evangelicalism.

They were especially concerned with Prohibition, suffrage, school issues, and public health.  Focusing on the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], a national network of middle-class women who formed local clubs, historian Paige Meltzer puts the women's clubs in the context of the [[Progressive Movement]], arguing that its policies:\n:built on Progressive-era strategies of [[Social housekeeping|municipal housekeeping]]. During the Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify their entrance into community affairs: as \"municipal housekeepers,\" they would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and wellbeing of their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists methodically investigated their community's needs and used their \"maternal\" expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman [[Julia Lathrop]]'s leadership in the [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]]. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.<ref>Paige Meltzer, \"The Pulse and Conscience of America\" The General Federation and Women's Citizenship, 1945\u20131960,\" ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'' (2009), Vol. 30 Issue 3, p52-76.

McPherson, ''Liberty, Equality, Power'' (2008) p. 538</ref> She helped turn the nation's attention to issues of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, public health, and world peace. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed the vote to be effective in doing so. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.

By the early 20th century some saw temporary migration to the United States to work as a rite of passage and a time of self-discovery and self-reliance. Most moved permanently to the United States, using the inexpensive railroad system to visit Quebec from time to time. When these women did marry, they had fewer children with longer intervals between children than their Canadian counterparts. Some women never married, and oral accounts suggest that self-reliance and economic independence were important reasons for choosing work over marriage and motherhood. These women conformed to traditional gender ideals in order to retain their 'Canadienne' cultural identity, but they also redefined these roles in ways that provided them increased independence in their roles as wives and mothers.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Florencemae |last=Waldron |title=The Battle Over Female (In)Dependence: Women In New England Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Migrant Communities, 1870\u20131930 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |year=2005 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=158\u2013205 |doi=10.1353/fro.2005.0032 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |first=Florencemae |last=Waldron |title='I've Never Dreamed It Was Necessary To 'Marry!': Women And Work in New England French Canadian Communities, 1870\u20131930 |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |year=2005 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=34\u201364 |url=http://jaeh.press.illinois.edu/24/2/waldron.html }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Midwest===\nMost young urban women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the eighth grade aged around fifteen. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. African-American mothers often chose day labor, usually as domestic servants, because of the flexibility it afforded. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.<ref>Kyle E. Ciani, \"Hidden Laborers: Female Day Workers In Detroit, 1870\u20131920,\" ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 23\u201351</ref>\n\nAcross the region, middle-class society women shaped numerous new and expanded charitable and professional associations, and promoted mother's pensions, and expanded forms of social welfare. Many of the Protestant homemakers were active in the temperance and suffrage movements as well.  In Detroit, the Federation of Women's Clubs (DFWC) promoted a very wide range of activities for civic-minded middle-class women who conformed to traditional gender roles. The Federation argued that safety and health issues were of greatest concern to mothers and could only be solved by improving municipal conditions outside the home. The Federation pressured Detroit officials to upgrade schools, water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to require safe food handling, and traffic safety. However, the membership was divided on going beyond these issues or collaborating with ethnic or groups or labor unions. Its refusal to stretch traditional gender boundaries, gave it a conservative reputation in the working-class. Before the 1930s, the women's affiliates of labor unions were too small and weak to fill the gap.<ref>Jayne Morris-Crowther, \"Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s,\" ''Michigan Historical Review,'' March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 31\u201357</ref>\n\n===South===\n[[File:Rebecca L.

An outspoken feminist, she became a leader of the prohibition and [[woman's suffrage]] movements, endorsed lynching (white Southerners should \"lynch a thousand [black men] a week if it becomes necessary\" to prevent the rape of white women), fought for reform of prisons, and filled leadership roles in many reform organizations. In 1922, she was appointed to the [[U.S. Senate]]. She was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served one day; she was the first woman to serve in the Senate.<ref>David B.

The state legislatures ignored efforts to let women vote in local elections. Georgia not only refused to ratify the Federal [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]], but took pride in being the first to reject it. The Amendment passed nationally and Georgia women gained the right to vote in 1920. However, black women did not vote until federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforced their constitutional rights.<ref>A. Elizabeth Taylor, \"Revival and Development of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Georgia,\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' Winter 1958, Vol. 42 Issue 4, pp 339\u2013354</ref>\n\nThe woman's reform movement flourished in cities; however the South was still heavily rural before 1945. In [[History of Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], women reformers did much to establish the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle-class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics in the name of social issues.<ref>Elizabeth York Enstam,  ''Women and the Creation of Urban Life: Dallas, Texas, 1843\u20131920.'' (1998).</ref>\n\nDuring 1913\u201319, advocates of woman suffrage in Dallas drew on the educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings to the task of political persuasion. The [[Dallas Equal Suffrage Association]] developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.<ref>Elizabeth York Enstam, \"The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association, Political Style, and Popular Culture: Grassroots Strategies of the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1913\u20131919.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 2002 68(4): 817\u2013848.</ref>\n\nBlack women reformers usually operated separately.

Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. The women did not often run for office\u2014that was seen as entangling their purity in the inevitable backroom deals routine in politics.<ref>Robert W.

In Chicago, the issue of black women voters was a competition between the middle-class women's clubs, and the black preachers.  Prominent women activists in Chicago included [[Ida B. Wells]] and [[Ada S. McKinley]], Who attracted a national audience, as well as Ella Berry, Ida Dempsey and Jennie Lawrence. By 1930, the Blacks comprised upwards of 1/5 of the Republican vote, and had a growing role in primary elections. For example, the Colored Women's Republican Club of Illinois Show their power in the 1928 primary, when their favorite [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]] outpolled former governor [[Charles S. Deneen]] three to one in the black wards and won the nomination for U.S. Senate. Year after year the white Republican leadership held out the hope of anti-lynching legislation, even though lynching had largely disappeared in most of the South by 1920, and in any case the votes were not there to pass it in Congress.  Loyalty to the Republicans as the \"party of Lincoln\" persisted until the [[New Deal Coalition]] offered more opportunities for patronage and welfare in the mid-1930s. There was a class division as well, as the middle class black women reformers spoken language of utopian promise that did not ring true to the poor uneducated maids and laundry workers, who listened every Sunday to the promises of salvation from their preachers.<ref>Lisa G.

J. Walker Manufacturing Company, Indianapolis, 1911]]\nMost of the [[African-American business history|African-Americans in business]] were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, \"Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.\" Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96.

After gaining suffrage, the political activities of women generally subsided or were absorbed in the main political parties. In the 1920s they paid special attention to such issues as world peace and child welfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/first-wave_feminism::sub::United_States |title=First-wave feminism : United States |publisher=Servinghistory.com |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the National Women's Party (NWP) continued the political fight.. Led by [[Alice Paul]], the group proposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women.<ref>Nancy Woloch,  ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (McGraw-Hill, 2002) p. 246.</ref> But many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood.

Prior to the 19th Amendment, feminists commonly thought that women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing that one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own but also families.<ref>Brown, Dorothy M. ''Setting a Course: American Women in the 1920s'' (Twayne Publishers, 1987) p. 33.</ref> The \"new\" woman was less invested in social service than the Progressive generations, and in tune with the capitalistic spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfilment.<ref>Nancy Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (2002). p. 256.</ref>\n\nThe 1920s saw significant change in the lives of working women. World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women.<ref>Alice Kessler-Harris, ''Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' (Oxford University Press, 2003) p. 219.</ref> Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, seventy-five percent of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers. The booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from working-class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.<ref>Kessler-Harris, '' Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' pp 237, 288.</ref>\n\nYoung women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], Havelock Ellis, and Ellen Key. There, thinkers outed that sex was not only central to the human experience but that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires just like men and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.<ref>Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' p. 274.</ref>\n\nThe 1920s saw the emergence of the co-ed, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream middle-class experience, but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, \"Husband and Wife\", \"Motherhood\" and \"The Family as an Economic Unit\". In an increasingly conservative post-war era, it was common for a young woman to attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband.  Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, dating underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the automobile, courtship occurred in a much more private setting. \"Petting\", sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for college students.<ref>Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'', p. 281-3.</ref>\n\nDespite women's increased knowledge of pleasure and sex, the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the \u2018feminine mystique\u2019. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible in order to better their families and their homes.<ref>Ruth Schwartz Cowan, ''Two Washes in the Morning and a Bridge Party at Night: The American Housewife between the Wars'' (1976)  p. 184.</ref>\n\n====Flappers====\nThe \"new woman\" was in fashion throughout the twenties; this meant a woman who rejected the pieties (and often the politics) of the older generation, smoked and drank in public, had casual sex, and embraced consumer culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5117/ |title=The New Woman of the 1920s: Debating Bobbed-Hair |publisher=Historymatters.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Also called \"flappers\", these women wore short skirts (at first just to the ankles, eventually up to the knees) and bobbed hair in a short cut \u2013 like a boy's, but longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1920s-fashion-and-music.com/1920s-Flapper.html |title=1920s Flapper |publisher=1920s-fashion-and-music.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Just as the flapper rejected the long hair popular in earlier years, she also discarded Victorian fashions, especially the corset, which accentuated women's curves.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/mmh/clash/NewWoman/Subnarratives/the%20flapper.htm |title=The Flapper |publisher=Ehistory.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Flappers preferred to be slender, although it sometimes meant dieting or binding their breasts and wearing restrictive undergarments to appear thin, flat-chested, and long-limbed.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/> Cultivating a flapper image and adhering to modern beauty standards also involved purchasing and applying cosmetics, which had not often been done previously by women other than prostitutes.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/> These women further pushed the boundaries of what was considered proper for a woman by their public activities; swearing, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol (illegal from 1920 until 1933), dancing, and dating.<ref name=\"ehistory.osu.edu\"/>\n\n====Firsts====\nWomen achieved many groundbreaking firsts in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Italian-American media disapproved. It demanded the holding of the line regarding traditional gender roles in which men controlled their families.  Many traditional patriarchal values prevailed among Southern European male immigrants, although some practices like dowry were left behind in Europe. The community spokesman Were shocked that the image of a woman with a secret ballot. They ridiculed flappers and proclaimed that feminism was immoral. They idealizes an old male model of Italian womanhood. Mussolini was popular, and when he expanded the electorate to include some women voting at the local level, the Italian American editorialists went along, arguing that the true Italian woman was, above all, a mother and a wife and, therefore, would be reliable as a voter on local matters. Feminist organizations in Italy were ignored, as the editors purposely associated emancipation with Americanism and transformed the debate over women's rights into a defense of the Italian-American community to set its own boundaries and rules.<ref>B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Deschamps, \"The Italian-American Press and the \"Woman Question\", 1915\u20131930,\" ''Studi Emigrazione'' (June 2003) 40#150, pp 303\u2013314.</ref>\n\n=== Great Depression of 1930s ===\nIn 1932, [[Hattie Caraway]] of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000138 |title=CARAWAY, Hattie Wyatt \u2013 Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, in 1932 [[Amelia Earhart]] became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, taking her journey on the 5th anniversary of Lindbergh's solo Atlantic flight .<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliaearhart.com/about/achievements.html |title=The Official Website of Amelia Earhart |publisher=Ameliaearhart.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> She was awarded the National Geographic Society's gold medal from President Herbert Hoover, and Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Later in 1932 she became the first woman to fly solo nonstop coast to coast, and set the women's nonstop transcontinental speed record, flying 2,447.8&nbsp;miles in 19 hours 5 minutes.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> In 1935, she became the first person to solo the 2,408-mile distance across the Pacific between Honolulu and Oakland, California; this was also the first flight where a civilian aircraft carried a two-way radio.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> Still later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo nonstop from Mexico City to Newark.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> In 1937, Amelia Earhart began a flight around the world but vanished during it; her remains, effects, and plane have never been found.<ref name=\"ameliaearhart.com\"/> The first woman to fly solo around the world and return home safely was the American amateur pilot [[Jerrie Mock]], who did so in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/jerrie-mock-record-breaking-american-female-pilot.htm |title=Jerrie Mock: Record-Breaking American Female Pilot |publisher=History Net |date= June 12, 2006|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> In 1933, [[Frances Perkins]] was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as his Secretary of Labor, making her the first woman to hold a job in a Presidential cabinet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USARperkins.htm |title=Frances Perkins |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |date=May 14, 1965 |accessdate=February 27, 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917032306/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USARperkins.htm |archivedate=September 17, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nHowever, women also faced many challenges during this time.

In relief programs, they were eligible for jobs only if they were the breadwinner in the family. Nevertheless, relief agencies did find jobs for women. The WPA employed about 500,000. The largest number, 295,000,  worked on sewing projects, producing 300 million items of clothing and mattresses for people on relief and for public institutions such as orphanages. Many other women worked in school lunch programs.<ref>Martha Swain, '\"The Forgotten Woman': Ellen S.

Women factory workers embodied the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" model.]]\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, 12 million women were already working (making up one quarter of the workforce), and by the end of the war, the number was up to 18 million (one third of the workforce).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/pwro/collection/website/rosie.htm |title=Rosie the Riveter: Women Working During World War II |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Eventually 3 million women worked in war plants, but the majority of women who worked during World War II worked in traditionally female occupations, like the service sector.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> During this time, Government propaganda calling on women to enter the workforce during the emergency popularized the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" image Of women assuming male roles.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nStandlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the \"home\" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the \"home front\". Meanwhile, the public sphere\u2014the male domain\u2014was redefined as the international stage of military action.<ref>Alecea Standlee, \"Shifting Spheres: Gender, Labor and the Construction of National Identity in U.S. Propaganda during the Second World War,\" ''Minerva Journal of Women & War'' Spring 2010, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 43\u201362</ref>\n\n====Employment====\nWartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor for women, as young-able bodied men were sent overseas and war time manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\">{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan |date=1982 |title=Home Front and Beyond: American Women in the 1940s |url=https://archive.org/details/homefrontbeyonda00hartrich|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=Twayne Publishers |page= |isbn=}}</ref> This was catalyzed by the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" phenomenon.\n\nThe composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed considerably over the course of the war. One in every ten married women entered the labor force during the war, and they represented more than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the nation's history there were more married women than single women in the female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women were actually employed at some time during that year at the height of wartime production.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/> In the same year the unemployment rate hit an all-time historical low of 1.2%.<ref>Tassava, Christopher.

Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice as likely to seek jobs.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/>\n\nFundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as \"men's work;\" however, the work women did was typically catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation By Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatwork00ruth|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=}}</ref> For example, in a [[Sperry Gyroscope Company|Sperry Corporation]] recruitment pamphlet the company stated, \"Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press.\" A [[Ford Motor Company]] at [[Willow Run]] bomber plant publication proclaimed, \"The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters.\" One manager was even stated saying, \"Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles and darning needs all their lives?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation by Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatwork00ruth |location=Urbana |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=0252013522 }}</ref> In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.\n\nFollowing the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]] (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant) worker in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]] confessed, \"I will gladly get back into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all my life. It was just to help out during the war.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kenney |first=Dave |date=2005 |title=Minnesota at Work |url= |location=St. Paul |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Other women were laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not lose their seniority due to the war.\n\nBy the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not return. This left women to take up sole responsibility of the household and provide economically for the family.\n\n====Black women====\nBefore the war most black women had been farm laborers in the South or domestics in Southern towns or Northern cities.<ref>Maureen Honey ''Bitter Fruit: African American Women in World War II'' (1999).</ref> Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these black women fought a \"[[Double V campaign]]\" \u2014fighting against the Axis abroad and against restrictive hiring practices at home. Their efforts redefined citizenship, equating their patriotism with war work, and seeking equal employment opportunities, government entitlements, and better working conditions as conditions appropriate for full citizens.<ref>Megan Taylor Shockley, 'Working For Democracy: Working-Class African-American Women, Citizenship, and Civil Rights in Detroit, 1940\u20131954,' ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2003), 29:125\u2013157.</ref> In the South, black women worked in segregated jobs; in the West and most of the North, they were integrated. However, [[wildcat strike]]s erupted in Detroit, Baltimore, and [[Evansville, Indiana]] where white migrants from the South refused to work alongside black women.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984), pp. 128\u20139</ref><ref>Daniel Kryder, ''Divided Arsenal: Race and the American State During World War II'' (2000), pp. 113\u201329</ref>\n\n===Nursing===\n\nNursing became a highly prestigious occupation for young women.

Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also created rubber band balls, which they contributed to the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.\n\nThe [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying a warplane had always been a male role. No American women flew warplanes in combat.<ref>Molly Merryman, ''Clipped Wings: The Rise and Fall of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS) of World War II'' (2001)</ref>\n\n===Baby boom===\nMarriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who had postponed marriage. The birth rate started shooting up in 1941, paused in 1944\u201345 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the \"[[Baby Boom]].\"\n\nIn a New Deal-like move, the federal government set up the \"EMIC\" program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant.\n\nHousing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little housing had been built in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] years, so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1949, when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand. (After 1944, much of the new housing was supported by the [[G.I. Bill]].)\n\nFederal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range terms, divorce rates changed little.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984) pp 88\u201390.</ref>\n\n===Housewives===\n[[File:Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum July 2015 44 (World War II American home front diorama).jpg|thumb|A World War II American home front diorama, depicting a woman and her daughter, at the [[Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum]]]]\n\nJuggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service, and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.\n\nStress came when sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fianc\u00e9s were drafted and sent to faraway training camps, preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training camps.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984) pp 187\u2013212.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, parallel with the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements]], women with more radical ideas about feminist goals began to organize. In her work, ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967\u20131975'', historian [[Alice Echols]] gives a thorough description of the short-lived movement. The radical feminists were after not only the end of female oppression by men but, as Echols notes, \"They also fought for safe, effective, accessible contraception; the repeal of all abortion laws; the creation of high-quality, community-controlled child-care centers; and an end to the media\u2019s objectification of women.<ref name=Echols /> \"\n\nSmall protests and signs of a larger support for radical feminism became more cohesive during the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) June 1967 National Convention in Ann Arbor. The \"Women\u2019s Liberation Workshop\" denounced sexual inequality and stated, \"As we analyze the position of women in capitalist society and especially the United States we find that women are in a colonial relationship to men and we recognize ourselves as part of the Third World.\"<ref name=Echols /> Co-written by Jane Addams, one of the most prominent women in SDS, they argued that women's place within SDS was subordinate and revolution could not succeed without women's liberation.<ref name=Echols />\n\nSDS women, including [[Susan Stern]] of the Weathermen, and women from the Old Left, including [[Clara Fraser]] and Gloria Martin, came together to found [http://historylink.org/File/2152 Radical Women] in Seattle in November 1967. [[Radical Women]] identified as socialist feminist and described its political views in \"The Radical Women Manifesto.\" The group called for multi-issue struggle around issues of sex, race and class and defended lesbian/gay rights. Radical Women celebrated its [http://www.seattlestar.net/2017/09/radical-women-celebrate-a-half-century-of-hell-raising/ 50th anniversary of activism in 2017.] (There is no relationship between Radical Women and the short-lived group known as New York Radical Women.)\n\nWhile radical feminists agreed that a separate movement for them was needed, how that movement looked and its ultimate goals caused much divide. They questioned whether they should include men within their movement, whether they should focus on issues of war, race and class, and who or what it was they were exactly rallying against. There were also issues concerning African American women within the movement; while the radical feminists felt gender to be the greatest issue, African American women were also very much concerned with racism and many found that to be where oppression was most domineering. Despite being inspired by the black power movement, radical feminists had difficulty figuring out a place for race within their gender-centric movement. They were also divided over the place of lesbianism in the movement.<ref name=Echols />\n\nNotable radical feminist groups included [[Redstockings]], founded in 1969. The group focused on power dynamics in gender and promoted consciousness-raising and distributed movement literature for free. [[Cell 16]], founded in 1968, was a much more militant group arguing that women were conditioned by their sex-roles. [[The Feminists]], founded by [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]] in 1968, claimed women were complicit in their oppression and needed to shed conventional gender roles. [[New York Radical Feminists]], founded in 1969, also found maleness to be the greater issue than power roles. They were interested in building a larger movement through mass numbers in New York City.<ref name=Echols />\n\nEchols describes the movement's end: \n\"Radical feminism remained the hegemonic tendency within the women\u2019s liberation movement until 1973 when cultural feminism began to cohere and challenge its dominance. After 1975, a year of internecine conflicts between radical and cultural feminists, cultural feminism eclipsed radical feminism as the dominant tendency within the women\u2019s liberation movement, and, as a consequence, liberal feminism became the recognized voice of the women\u2019s movement.\"<ref name=Echols />\nThe end of the counterculture movements and the government's observation of the movement also contributed to its end. The radical feminist movement demonstrated that Second-wave feminism was diverse in its goals, but also divided within itself. Echols notes, \"To many women, liberal feminism\u2019s considerably more modest goal of bringing women into the mainstream seemed more palatable, not to mention more realistic, than the radical feminist project of fundamentally reconstructing private and public life.\"<ref name=Echols /> She also states that despite the fact that younger generations don't often see this movement as relevant, it is because feminist movements during this time actually did make significant changes.<ref name=Echols /><ref name=Echols>{{cite book|last=Echols|first=Alice|title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967\u20131975|url=https://archive.org/details/daringtobebadrad0000echo|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota|isbn=978-0816617876}}</ref>\n\n===Abortion===\nOne of the most controversial developments in American women's lives has been the legalization of abortion.

It coordinated efforts across the South to tell the story of the women on the Confederate homefront, while the male historians spent their time with battles and generals. The women emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They reported that when all the men left for war, the women took command, found ersatz and substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced danger without having menfolk in the traditional role of their protectors.<ref>Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865\u20131913'' (1985) p 30</ref> Historian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] argues that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:\n{{quote|UDC leaders were determined to assert women's cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region's past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.<ref>Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, \"'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique.\" ''Journal of American History'' (1998): 439\u2013465 at p 450.

Breakthroughs began in the late 1960s, as increasing numbers of women entered graduate schools, wrote seminar papers that became journal articles, and finished dissertations that became published books. By the 1970s, major publishers were eager to have a few titles on women in their list, and journal editors were equally receptive.<ref>Bonnie G.

An important development is to integrate women into the history of race and slavery. A pioneer effort was [[Deborah Gray White]]'s '''Ar'n't I a Woman?
