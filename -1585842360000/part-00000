Their partnership was uniquely successful, Elvis being an entirely new force in popular music, and Parker an entrepreneur able to market him.\n\nAt age 18, Parker had arrived in America by jumping ship, and never held a US passport, even when the [[Smith Act|1940 Alien Registration Act]] would have entitled him to one. This is attributed to his uncertain legal status, possibly connected to police inquiries about a murder in his native [[Breda]]. To the puzzlement of overseas fans, he never worked abroad for fear of apprehension, nor did he allow Elvis to tour overseas. While Presley was stationed in [[West Germany]] during his [[Elvis Presley's Army career|two-year Army service]] from 1958 to 1960, Parker never left the borders of the United States. Parker's Dutch birthplace and immigrant status were not revealed for many years.\n\nA carnival worker by background, Parker moved into music promotion, earning the courtesy rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019 from a grateful singer [[Jimmie Davis]], who had become the [[Governor of Louisiana]]. After discovering the teenage [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]], Parker discovered the then-unknown Elvis Presley in 1955, and skillfully maneuvered himself into position as his sole representative with control over much of his private life. Within months, he had won Presley a recording contract with the prestigious RCA Victor record label, made him a star in 1956 with his first single \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", negotiated lucrative merchandising deals, and made plans for TV appearances as well as a new career as an actor in film musicals.\n\nWhen Presley was drafted into the US Army in 1958, Parker was shrewd enough to see that military service would boost his image, and made no attempt to stop his posting to [[West Germany|Germany]]. He also judged correctly that public demand would be whetted by his two-year absence, and he stage-managed a triumphal homecoming rail-tour to Memphis.\n\nBut the 1960s would impact hard on Elvis's public and private life. The youth market was suddenly being taken over by a new British band called [[The Beatles]]. The films became low-budget production-line work, however profitable. Also, Elvis's bachelor live-in arrangement with the teenage [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]], against her father's wishes, threatened a possible image crisis, and Parker urged at marriage. By the end of the decade, Elvis had gone back on tour, but years of binge-eating and unofficially prescribed drugs had ruined his health, and Parker, realizing there was little profit margin left in Presley, saw very little of Presley before his death in August 1977.\n\nParker continued to manage the Presley estate, but he had unwisely sold the rights to Elvis's early recordings, which would have ensured a steady income. In 1980, a judge ordered an investigation into Parker's management practices and found Parker was unethical.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Meanwhile, his gambling habit increasingly eroded the huge fortune he had built up by claiming over 50% of Presley's earnings, and he died in obscurity worth only $1,000,000.\n\n==Early life==\nParker was born as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk on June 26, 1909 in [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]],<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and was the seventh of eleven children.<ref name=\"Nash11\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|page=11}}</ref> As a boy, he worked as a [[Barker (occupation)|barker]] at carnivals in his hometown, learning many of the skills that he would require later while working in the entertainment industry.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Strauss, Neil|title=Tom Parker is Dead at 87; Controlled Presley's Career|work=New York Times|date= January 22, 1997}}</ref><ref name=\"Victor394\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAt age 15, van Kuijk moved to [[Rotterdam]], gaining employment on boats in the port town.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> At age 17, he first displayed signs of wanting to run away to the [[United States]] to \"make his fortune.\"<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> A year later, with enough money to sustain him for a short period, he entered America illegally by jumping ship from his employer's vessel.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> During his first visit there, he traveled with a [[Chautauqua]] educational tent show, before returning briefly to the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn ''The Colonel'', her biography of Parker, Alanna Nash wrote that there were questions about a murder in Breda in which Parker may have been a suspect or at least a person of interest.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=39\u201351}} This may have motivated him to avoid seeking a passport, as the Netherlands has an active [[extradition]] treaty with the United States, and he may have wanted to avoid criminal arrest by Dutch authorities in that case.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=39\u201351}}\n\nAndreas Cornelis van Kuijk returned to the US at age 20, finding work with carnivals due to his previous experience in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He enlisted in the [[United States Army]], taking the name \"Tom Parker\" from the same name of the officer who interviewed him, to disguise the fact he was an illegal immigrant.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nHe served two years in the [[64th Coast Artillery (United States)]], at [[Fort Shafter]], in [[Hawaii]], and shortly afterwards re-enlisted at [[Fort Barrancas, Florida]].<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Although Parker had served honorably before, he went [[AWOL]] this time and was charged with [[desertion]].<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He was punished with solitary confinement, from which he emerged with a [[psychosis]] that led to him spending two months in a mental hospital,<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and he was discharged from the Army because of his mental condition.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Parker worked at a number of jobs, including food concessions and gaming carnivals.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> From about 1931 until 1938 he worked as a \"[[carny]]\" with [[Royal American Shows]].<ref name=dickerson>{{cite book |last=Dickerson |first=James L.  |date=2003 |title=Colonel Tom Parker: The Curious Life of Elvis Presley's Eccentric Manager |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zeeQUSywek4C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22carl+sedlmayr+jr%22&source=bl&ots=Y5GlQi8aRE&sig=ACfU3U1jAvgD3uv_NrELQiUFKk-mJk_a1A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1k7TlvovmAhXsSBUIHdu7DwEQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22carl%20sedlmayr%20jr%22&f=false |location= |publisher= Cooper Square Press|page=5-7 |isbn=058538827X |author-link=}}</ref> He began to build up a list of contacts that would prove valuable in later years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn 1935, Parker married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.

The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Presley and his parents.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When the contract expired, the Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Presley's manager. At that point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Presley.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Neal was struggling at the time to accommodate his new client's success, and in February 1955, following a meeting with Parker, Presley agreed to let Parker take some control of future bookings and promotions.<ref name=\"Victor\"/>\n\nParker and Neal worked together to promote Presley, using their own ''Hank Snow Tour'' to book him and tour him.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> Although Neal remained Presley's official manager, Parker was becoming increasingly involved in the running of his career, and by the summer of 1955 he had become Presley's \"special advisor.\"<ref name=\"Victor\"/> As Presley was still a minor, his parents had to sign the contract with Parker on his behalf.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1988|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-246-13459-2|pages=85\u201390}}</ref><ref>This deed on the part of Vernon and Gladys Presley marked the real permanent separation of Elvis from his mother, and as Elvis was a classic \"mama's boy,\" it was this, rather than his entrance into the Army or the later death of Gladys, from which he never truly recovered and which ultimately killed him.</ref> Part of Parker's role was to secure a new recording contract with a bigger label.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> Presley had been at [[Sun Records]] since the beginning of his career, but [[Sam Phillips]], the owner of Presley's current label, was aware that for Presley to have any kind of a successful future in the business he would need the backing of a much larger label.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> Despite this, Phillips was not keen to let him go easily, advising Parker that he would require $40,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to secure the release of Presley's contract, a completely unheard-of sum at the time.<ref name=\"Victor\"/>\n\nParker immediately went to work to find a new label for Presley.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> Both [[Mercury Records]] and [[Columbia Records]] showed interest, although their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> [[RCA Victor]], Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were also put off by the cost of the contract.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> However, RCA Victor producer [[Steve Sholes]] was convinced that Presley's style of music would be a huge hit with the right label, and he began talks with Parker.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> RCA made it very clear they were unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer,<ref name=\"Victor\"/> but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer.<ref name=\"Victor\"/> Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted once again to sell Tommy Sands to RCA.<ref name=nash120/> He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley's style.<ref name=nash120/> Sholes, remembering his previous experience with Sands, dismissed him as a viable replacement for Presley.<ref name=nash120/>\n\nIn November, Parker and Snow persuaded RCA to buy Presley out from Sun for $40,000, and on November 21, Presley's contract was officially transferred from Sun Records to RCA Victor.

He had booked him into a four-week [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] engagement, misjudging the reaction of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted.<ref name=\"Day\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=71|ref=harv}}</ref> While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, the middle-aged audiences found him to be something of an oddity.<ref name=\"Day\"/> Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found his manner of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} After a very cool reception during his first few shows,{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 7, track 4}} Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.<ref name=\"Day\"/>\n\nDespite this hiccup in his career, Presley was still going from strength to strength. He had expressed interest in making films when he first met Parker, and now Parker was working to make that happen. He arranged for a screen test with [[Paramount Pictures]], and after impressing them with his acting ability, Presley was signed to a seven-picture contract.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=67}} Parker made sure that the contract allowed Presley the freedom to make at least one film a year with another studio, and also managed to set up an office, with staff, at Paramount. Presley's acting career was originally intended to be a serious one, but after seeing a chance to cross-promote singles and albums with the films, Parker persuaded him to sing in his films. This proved very lucrative, especially when the single for Presley's first film, ''[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]],'' sold over one million copies in advance sales. With 1956 coming to a close, Parker had made Presley one of the most well-known, well-paid entertainers in the world.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=94}}\n\nIn 1957, Parker finally managed to give Tommy Sands his big break by arranging for him to audition for and star in ''The Singin' Idol'', a drama for [[NBC]] that was loosely based on the life and career of Presley.<ref name=nash120/> NBC had originally wanted Presley for the role, but Parker had turned them down.<ref name=nash120/> In the drama the role of Parker was portrayed as a \"twisted psychopath\".<ref name=nash120/> Critics were very positive in their reviews of both the drama and Sands, leading to [[Capitol Records]] signing Sands within a week.<ref name=nash120/> Soon after, Sands' song \"[[Teen-Age Crush]]\" reached number 2 on the pop charts, eventually selling 800,000 copies.<ref name=nash120/>\n\n====Elvis in the Army (1958\u20131960)====\nRegardless of the success that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two.<ref name=\"Vel102\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his [[Conscription|draft notice]] from the United States Army.<ref name=\"Day4\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=95}}</ref> He was upset about the possibility of it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nParker was looking ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had wanted to join [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], allowing him the opportunity to continue to perform while at the same time getting an easier ride than other soldiers.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nWhile Presley was serving in West Germany, Parker was hard at work keeping his name known to the public. He realized that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, he would be able to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction,<ref name=\"Vel106\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.\n\nParker appeared to be in complete control during Presley's time away, but he was worried about the outside influence that Presley might come across in Germany.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Parker had declined to travel to Europe, denying that he spoke any language other than English.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He sent Presley's friends to keep him company, arranged for business associates to watch over him while they were working in Europe, and kept in regular contact with him via telephone and letter.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He was afraid that Presley would realize that there were other managers available, contracts that did not require as much as 25% for his manager. Parker was still worried that Presley would return to nothing, that the public would have found a new star to fawn over by then, and that his golden goose would be reduced to nothing more than a \"has-been.\"<ref name=\"Vel106\"/>\n\n====Elvis returns (1960\u20131965)====\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker had arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=149}}</ref> If Parker had had any doubts about his return, they were soon gone when he witnessed the turnout along the route.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]], who had declared Presley and rock and roll a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show.<ref name=\"Vel112\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=112\u201315}}</ref> Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be {{US$|125000|1960|long=no|about=yes|round=-3}} for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=140}}</ref> but he agreed. The show, entitled \u201cWelcome Home, Elvis\u201d, was Presley's first national television appearance since ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in January 1957.\n\nAfter the Sinatra special, Parker decided that Presley's future lay in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He envisioned him as an entertainment machine, pumping out three films and soundtracks a year, until the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He allowed him to perform three live shows in 1961, all charity events, two in Memphis and one in Hawaii.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> After that, until 1968, Presley gave no live performances, and had very little contact with his fans.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> Parker signed long-term contracts with the film studios,<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> possibly to guarantee work and income for both him and Presley. This was, with hindsight, a mistake on his part; if he had negotiated each deal separately based on the profits of the previous film, he could have received more money.<ref name=\"Vel118\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=118\u2013121}}</ref> Throughout the 1960s Parker would continually renegotiate Presley's film contracts, often paying little attention to the scripts or the thoughts of his client.<ref name=doll139>Doll, ''Elvis for Dummies'', p. 139.</ref> These deals were sometimes so harsh on the studios that it led producer [[Hal Wallis]] to state, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the Devil.\"<ref name=doll139/>\n\nPresley had to do no more than provide RCA with three albums a year,<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no touring or public appearances to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as [[the Beatles]] began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as [[Beatlemania]] began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/>\n\n====Dead ends (1966\u20131967)====\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[The Beach Boys]] dominated the charts. Later in 1983, Parker admitted during an interview that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.\n<ref name=\"Vel127\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=127\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nTo make up for lack of earnings, Parker arranged for Presley's gold Cadillac to go on tour.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Selling it to RCA for $24,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), it was used to promote Presley's latest film, ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1966 film)|Frankie & Johnny]].''<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> In [[Houston]] alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 1967, Parker re-negotiated his managerial/agent contract with Presley, persuading him to increase Parker's share from 25% to 50% on certain transactions. When critics questioned this arrangement and that Parker was exploiting Presley for more money because of greed, Presley quipped \"I could have signed with East Coast Entertainment where they take 70 percent!\"<ref name=\"AZ\">{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Fred|title=Elvis: His Life from A to Z|year=1992|publisher=Outlet|isbn=978-0-517-06634-8|page=149}}</ref> Parker used the argument that Presley was his only client and he was thus earning only one fee.<ref name=\"AZ\"/>\n\nAfter Presley showed signs of rebellion again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker decided that it was time for a new approach: marriage.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Frank Sinatra had married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with [[Priscilla Beaulieu]], ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin \u2013 and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.\n\nParker hoped that marriage would not only boost Presley's career but also possibly tame him.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> With Priscilla's father dropping heavy hints, and fear that their relationship might become public beforehand, Parker persuaded Presley that he should make an \"honest woman\" of her in the very near future. However, it would be a quiet wedding. Parker decided that Las Vegas was the perfect place to do it,<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> and on May 1, 1967, the couple were married in a ceremony that lasted only eight minutes and had a handful of guests.<ref name=\"Vel134\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=134\u2013140}}</ref> A breakfast reception was arranged, taking place after the media got their photographs of the couple.<ref name=\"Vel134\"/>\n\n====The comeback (1968\u20131972)====\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker|Elvis Presley and Parker on a Hollywood film set, 1969]]\nIt took the energetic 1968 television special ''[[Singer Presents...ELVIS|Elvis]]'', which the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that included songs such as \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\" and \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene and the culture in the latter part of the decade had radically changed. The \"Singer Special\" TV show was not intended to turn out the way it did. Parker was adamant that Presley would wear a Santa suit and other holiday garb and sing Christmas songs, as the show was to be broadcast in December 1968. (Several Presley historians have noted the original title for the special was to be ''Elvis and the Wonderful World of Christmas''.) It was the producer of the show, [[Steve Binder]], who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D. J. Fontana]], the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it \"Binder's way.\" This was the first time in the partnership that Presley fully rebelled against Parker.\n\nPresley and Binder's instincts were proven right; the TV special proved an enormous hit, and the album that was released featuring performances from the special became a best-seller. Presley historians have also said doing the special whetted Presley's appetite to perform live again after nearly a decade away from the stage. After the special, Parker managed Presley's return to live performance, including a set of brief U.S. tours and many engagements in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Following the success of Presley's Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), an unheard-of sum at the time. During this part of Presley's career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 \"partnership,\" which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client.\n\nAfter the success of Presley's return to live performing in Las Vegas, Parker decided it was time to take him back out on tour for the first time in 13 years.<ref name=enc384>Victor, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pp. 384\u2013395</ref> The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold.<ref name=enc384/> He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow, so that he and Presley rarely saw each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley.<ref name=enc384/> These live performances, as well as being financially satisfying, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.<ref>Carr & Farren, ''The Complete Illustrated Record''.</ref>\n\nBy 1972, Parker had managed to increase Presley's weekly wage in Las Vegas to $150,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), and secured $50,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for himself as a \"consultant to the hotel chain\".{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Parker had also decided that it was time for Presley to return to New York, and had arranged for him to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]] in June.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Originally planned as three performances, demand was so high that Parker decided to add a fourth performance, making Presley the first performer to sell out the venue four consecutive times. These four shows alone grossed $730,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|730000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}}\n\nOn July 8, 1972, inspired by [[1972 Nixon visit to China|the visit]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] to China a few months earlier,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Careless Love: Unmaking of Elvis Presley|year=1999|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11168-1|pages=}}</ref> Parker announced that there would be a worldwide satellite broadcast from Hawaii to allow the whole world the chance to see a Presley concert, \"since it is impossible for us to play in every major city.\"<ref name=\"Day322\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=}}</ref> (During Presley's career, except for a few concerts in Canada in 1957, he never performed outside the United States.) Parker held another press conference on September 4, 1972 in Las Vegas to confirm that the concert, now titled ''Aloha From Hawaii,'' would be broadcast on January 14, 1973.<ref name=\"Day322\"/> The press were told that an audience of 1 billion was expected to tune in to see the \"first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world,\"<ref name=\"Day322\"/> although Parker had not taken into account the fact that many countries, including parts of Europe and America, would not see the concert live due to the time of the broadcast.<ref name=\"Day322\"/> Two weeks after the Las Vegas press conference Parker received a letter from ''Honolulu Advertiser'' columnist Eddie Sherman.<ref name=\"Gur478\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley|url=https://archive.org/details/carelessloveunma00gural|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-33222-4|pages=}}</ref> Sherman had read in news accounts that there was to be no charge for admittance to the concerts, a donation to charity being required instead.

The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973.<ref name=enc384/> To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement.<ref name=enc384/> Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter.

However, other friends and members of Presley's entourage have stood by the suggestion that Parker didn't want to admit there was such a problem because he didn't know how to deal with it, and he was also worried about any negative publicity it would create.<ref name=nash384/> According to Parker himself, he did privately attempt to talk to his client a number of times about the matter, but that allegedly every time Parker casually told Presley to quit or at least tone it down with the pill popping and binge eating, Presley would respond by telling Parker, in a simple but firm tone, to stay out of his personal business.<ref name=nash384/>\n\n=====1975\u20131977=====\nIn February 1975, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Jon Peters]].<ref name=nash384/> They discussed the possibility of Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film'' [[A Star is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]].''<ref name=nash384/> Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, [[Jerry Schilling]], Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge.<ref name=nash384/> Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and 10% of the profits.<ref name=nash384/> Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal.<ref name=nash384/> First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counter-offer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to [[Kris Kristofferson]] who accepted.<ref name=nash384/> Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role.<ref name=nash384/>\n\nLater in 1975, the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] offered Parker $5 million for Presley to perform there.<ref name=nash384/> Parker turned the offer down, and Presley was overjoyed when they replied with another offer of $10 million.<ref name=nash384/> Yet, despite Presley's eagerness to do the shows, Parker again turned them down.<ref name=nash384/> Promoters in South America also made offers, as much as $2.5 million, and all of them were turned down by Parker; \"Well, whenever I need $2.5 million I'll call you\" he once said to them.<ref name=nash384/> Presley was beginning to consider new management, with ''[[Concerts West]]'' co-founder Tom Hulett being the clear favorite for the job.<ref name=nash384/> Hulett's company had managed tours for Presley, and he had worked with artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]]. According to several people who knew Presley at the time, the talks with Hulett got so far along that it seemed almost inevitable the deal would be done. The talks had included details about European tours, and buying out Presley's contract would not have been a problem for Hulett and his company.<ref name=nash384/> Despite this, however, the deal never materialized. According to Presley's biographer [[Peter Guralnick]], Presley and Parker \"were really like, in a sense, a married couple, who started out with great love, loyalty, respect that lasted for a considerable period of time, and went through a number of stages until, towards the end of Presley's life, they should have walked away. None of the rules of the relationship were operative any longer, yet neither had the courage to walk away, for a variety of reasons.\" In any case, Parker remained Presley's manager without a break until Presley's death in 1977.\n\nBy this time, Parker was aware that Presley needed a rest from touring and the chance to deal with his prescription drug addictions.<ref name=nash390>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 290\u2013295.</ref> He phoned Presley's father once to suggest taking time off, but Vernon Presley told him they couldn't afford to stop touring due to Presley's constant and lavish spending of money.<ref name=nash390/> Vernon also threatened to find a new manager if Parker wouldn't continue to tour Presley.<ref name=nash390/>\n\nIn July 1976, three of Presley's personal bodyguards and members of the \"Memphis Mafia\", [[Red West|Robert Gene \"Red\" West]], his cousin [[Sonny West (actor)|Sonny West]] and David Hebler, were fired by Vernon Presley and decided to write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle, entitled ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'' <ref name=nash298>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 298\u2013302</ref> Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the publication of the book. Parker made several attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so.<ref name=nash298/> According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it.<ref name=nash298/> The book would eventually be published one year later on July 12, 1977, one month before Presley's death.\n\nFor the remainder of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale.<ref name=nash298/> Although Parker publicly denied these claims, he had been in talks with [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], manager of [[Led Zeppelin]], about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley.<ref name=nash298/> As with all the talk about Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.\n\n=====Lack of touring abroad=====\nPresley fans have speculated that the reason Presley only performed abroad once during his career, failing to undertake the highly lucrative prospect of touring other countries and continents, may have been that Parker was worried that he would not have been able to acquire a U.S. passport and might even have been deported upon filing his application. In addition, applying for the citizenship required for a US passport would probably have exposed his carefully concealed foreign birth. Although Parker was a US Army veteran and the spouse of an American citizen, one of the basic tenets of U.S. immigration law is that unless an application is made as part of an amnesty program, there are few paths to citizenship or even legal residency for those who entered the country illegally.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Julia|title=Tweak in Rule to Ease a Path to Green Card|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/path-to-green-card-for-illegal-immigrant-family-members-of-americans.html|accessdate=December 19, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> As Parker had not availed himself of the 1940 Alien Registration Act, and there was no amnesty program available to him afterwards, he was not eligible for US citizenship via any means.\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States \u2013 all of them in Canada: [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Vancouver]], during brief tours there in 1957. At the time of those concerts, crossing the US-Canada border did not require a passport. [[Red Robinson]], Vancouver radio icon and MC of the Presley concert in that city, said Parker did not accompany Presley to that show, but instead stayed in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, it is well-established that Parker did not accompany Presley on every tour and every performance date, even in the US, suggesting this may not have been the only rationale for Presley not performing abroad.\n\nRumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an [[Australia]]n tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. Parker ultimately quashed any notions Presley had of working abroad, although Presley did not push the issue, either.<ref>Stanly & Coffey, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', p. 123</ref>\n\nTo cover up Parker's need for questioning in criminal activity, many theories for Presley's lack of touring abroad have surfaced, including the following:\n* Parker's claims that foreign security was poor, relative to the USA.\n* Parker's belief that outside influences (managers, agents etc.) would inform Presley of how unusual his contract with Parker was.\n* Parker's claim that there was a lack of venues large enough to accommodate a star of Presley's stature. All of these excuses were given to Presley when he would show an interest in touring abroad and, known to avoid confrontation, Presley would never argue with Parker.\n* Some promoters wanted to charge fans the equivalent of $100 per ticket. Parker did not wish the fans to be ripped off, and this was another reason he turned down overseas offers.\n\n====Presley's death====\nWhen [[Elvis Presley#Final months and death|Presley died in August 1977]], one day before he was due to go out on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened.<ref name=\"Victor392\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia |year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co Ltd|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=392\u2013393}}</ref> Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered \"oh dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Roy|title=Elvis: The Illustrated Record |year=1982|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53979-9|pages=}}</ref>\n\nParker set out to protect his future income. Asked by a journalist what he would do now, Parker responded, \"Why, I'll just go right on managing him!\"<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Almost immediately, before even visiting Graceland, Parker traveled to New York City to meet with merchandising associates and RCA executives, instructing them to prepare for a huge demand in Presley products.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Shortly afterward, he traveled to Memphis for Presley's funeral. Mourners recall being surprised at his wearing a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap, smoking his trademark cigar, and purposely avoiding the casket.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> At the funeral, he persuaded Presley's father to sign over control of Presley's career in death to him.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/>\n\nIn September 1978, shortly after the first anniversary of Presley's death, Parker arranged a fan festival, ''Always Elvis'', where he, Vernon, and Presley's ex-wife [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla]], dedicated a bronze statue of him in the lobby of the [[Westgate Las Vegas|Las Vegas Hilton]].<ref name=nash315>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 315</ref>\n\n====After Elvis====\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc. Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> It was later revealed that Presley owned 22% of the company, Parker owned 56%, and the final 22% was made up of various business associates.<ref name=\"BMI\"/> Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Presley that gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc. Inc.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, it was discovered that Presley had lost out on royalties for songs on which he had been listed as an author and/or composer because Parker had unwisely advised him not to sign up to [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] or its younger competitor, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].<ref name=\"BMI\">{{cite book|last=Jobe Pierce|first=Patricia|title=The Ultimate Elvis|year=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0-671-87022-5|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateelviselv0000pier}}</ref> Experts in the field at the time estimated that it had potentially cost Presley millions of dollars<ref name=\"BMI\"/> and worse for Parker, it had also potentially cost him those millions of dollars. Parker had unknowingly backed himself into a financial corner.\n\nBy 1980, the cost of running the estate was estimated to be as much as $500,000 a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Priscilla and the Trust were prepared to let Parker continue to handle Presley's business affairs, and petitioned the court to that end.<ref name=\"Gaar240\">{{cite book|last=Gaar|first=Gillian G|title=Return of The King: Elvis Presley's Great Comeback|year=2010|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-28-2|pages=}}</ref> However, Judge Joseph Evans, aware that [[Lisa Marie Presley]] was still a minor, appointed attorney Blanchard E. Tual to investigate Parker's management.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Tual, once appointed as Lisa Marie's ''guardian ad litem'', chose to investigate the entire period of Parker's management of Presley; his preliminary finding was that Parker's management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15\u201320%.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He also noted that Parker's handling of Presley's business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, was \"unethical\" and poorly handled.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> During a second, more detailed investigation, Tual discovered that all earnings were paid directly to the Trust instead of Parker.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nOn August 14, 1981, Judge Evans ordered EPE to sue Parker for mismanagement.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> In response to this, Parker countersued.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}})<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> in exchange for all Presley audio recordings or visual images that he owned<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and the termination of his involvement in any Presley related earnings for five years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nParker had worked as a \"consultant\" for [[Hilton Hotels]] since Presley's death,<ref name=\"Nash328\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|pages=328\u2013335}}</ref> with some believing he was working to pay off debts owed to the casino from his gambling during Presley's performances there.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> Part of this role resulted in Parker keeping the same fourth-floor suite he occupied when Presley was alive, but by 1984, with his gambling debts reportedly rising again, he was evicted.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> On the surface, however, relations between the two were as good as ever, with Parker helping the Hilton to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Presley's death.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nThe disputes with the Presley estate did not terminate his association with his most high-profile client. Parker appeared at posthumous events honoring Presley, such as the 1993 issuing of the [[United States Postal Service]] stamp honoring the King of Rock and Roll. He also became friendly with the estate again, attending special ceremonies and events in Memphis, invited by Priscilla.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> However, he did occasionally step on their toes by commenting negatively on some of their decisions. In 1994, following the marriage of Lisa Marie and Michael Jackson, Parker stated that Presley would not have approved,<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> and in 1993, interest in Presley's enduring legend, interest that is sometimes notable for its obsessiveness, provoked Parker to remark, \"I don't think I exploited Elvis as much as he's being exploited today.\"<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nIn 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\nAs Presley's fame grew, people became interested in Parker as well. For a time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming to have been born in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], West Virginia, (to explain his Dutch accent as being a Southern accent) and to have run away at an early age to join a circus run by an uncle. The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the [[Netherlands]], recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley <ref>https://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/elvis-presley-col-tom-parker.html</ref>.\n\nOne of Parker's brothers, Adam \"Ad\" van Kuijk, visited Parker once in [[Los Angeles]] in April 1961. Parker privately acknowledged his brother and introduced him to Presley. During the week-long visit, Parker was informed by Adam van Kuijk that their mother had died three years earlier in 1958, never knowing what happened to her son after he left the Netherlands for good in 1929. Adam van Kuijk later died from emphysema in 1992, never seeing or visiting Parker again.<ref>https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/andreas-van-kuijk.shtml</ref>\n\nThe claim of Parker's Dutch heritage was publicly confirmed when Parker tried to avert a lawsuit brought against him in 1982 by asserting in open court that he was a Dutch citizen. In 1993, in one of his last media appearances, Parker appeared in a television interview with Dutch TV director [[Jorrit van der Kooi]] where they spoke to each other in Dutch about the Netherlands and about Elvis Presley's life and career. During the interview, Parker said that he was not aware that another one of his sisters, named Adriana van Kuijk, had died in the Netherlands a few years before.\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.<ref name=\"Vellenga\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and The Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Marie was one of six children,<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> had been married twice before, and had a son from her first marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> Unbeknownst to Parker at the time, she had a second son from her first marriage, but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability (a [[club foot]]).{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=71}} Some have suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the US;<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> a marriage to a US citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\".<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> However, there is no definite proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/>\n\nOthers, however, have doubts about whether they were legally married at all.<ref name=\"Nash\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|ref=harv|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> According to interviews given by Parker to the [[Associated Press]] many years later, he and Marie were married in [[Tampa, Florida]] during the winter of 1932,<ref name=\"Nash\"/> but the Florida Office of Vital Statistics has no record of such a marriage any time between 1927 and 1946.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> It is also recorded that Marie did not divorce her second husband until 1936, and her brother, [[Bitsy Mott|Bitsy]], recalls no ceremony of marriage between Parker and Marie.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> Author Alanna Nash suggests the couple may have simply placed their hands on a Bible and given themselves a \"carny wedding\".<ref name=\"Nash\"/>\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked together in the carnivals.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country. During the 1960s, after many years of ill health, Marie began to display signs of [[dementia]].{{sfn|Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} Parker began to distance himself from her, heartbroken by her slow mental deterioration from the woman he once knew.{{sfn|Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} Marie died in November 1986 of [[Post-concussion syndrome|chronic brain syndrome]] at age 78.{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=329}} In October 1990, Parker married Loanne Miller, his secretary since 1972.{{sfn |Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} From then on, he continued living in Las Vegas, mostly avoiding contact with the press.\n\n===Gambling===\nMany Parker biographers, including Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, have stated that Parker's gambling habit really began to get out of control in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> During the 1960s, with his wife's health deteriorating, and Presley's career struggling, Parker found an escape with gambling at Las Vegas casinos.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Fans and biographers alike believe that one of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover losses he experienced in their casino.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He would often spend 12\u201314 hours at a time gambling, betting large sums instead of small amounts.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> At the time of Presley's death it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton over $30 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30000000|1977}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> After a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, Parker's estate was barely worth $1 million when he died.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\n\"Colonel Tom Parker rubbed my head in Vegas,\" [[Eddie Murphy]] stated in 1989. \"A couple times he set me up in the Elvis Presley suite on top of [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino|the Hilton]], and I would go play Elvis for a week\u2026 One night we were at the [[Craps|crap table]] together and he rubbed my head for luck.

Their partnership was uniquely successful, Elvis being an entirely new force in popular music, and Parker an entrepreneur able to market him.\n\nAt age 18, Parker had arrived in America by jumping ship, and never held a US passport, even when the [[Smith Act|1940 Alien Registration Act]] would have entitled him to one. This is attributed to his uncertain legal status, possibly connected to police inquiries about a murder in his native [[Breda]]. To the puzzlement of overseas fans, he never worked abroad for fear of apprehension, nor did he allow Elvis to tour overseas. While Presley was stationed in [[West Germany]] during his [[Elvis Presley's Army career|two-year Army service]] from 1958 to 1960, Parker never left the borders of the United States. Parker's Dutch birthplace and immigrant status was not revealed for many years.\n\nA carnival worker by background, Parker moved into music promotion, earning the courtesy rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019 from a grateful singer [[Jimmie Davis]], who had become the [[Governor of Louisiana]]. After discovering the teenage [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]], Parker discovered the then-unknown Elvis Presley in 1955, and skillfully maneuvered himself into position as his sole representative with control over much of his private life. Within months, he had won Presley a recording contract with the prestigious RCA Victor record label, made him a star in 1956 with his first single \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", negotiated lucrative merchandising deals, and made plans for TV appearances as well as a new career as an actor in film musicals.\n\nWhen Presley was drafted into the US Army in 1958, Parker was shrewd enough to see that military service would boost his image, and made no attempt to stop his posting to [[West Germany|Germany]]. He also judged correctly that public demand would be whetted by his two-year absence, and he stage-managed a triumphal homecoming rail-tour to Memphis.\n\nBut the 1960s would impact hard on Elvis's public and private life. The youth market was suddenly being taken over by a new British band called [[The Beatles]]. The films became low-budget production-line work, however profitable. Also, Elvis's bachelor live-in arrangement with the teenage [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]], against her father's wishes, threatened a possible image crisis, and Parker urged at marriage. By the end of the decade, Elvis had gone back on tour, but years of binge-eating and unofficially prescribed drugs had ruined his health, and Parker, realizing there was little profit margin left in Presley, saw very little of Presley before his death in August 1977.\n\nParker continued to manage the Presley estate, but he had unwisely sold the rights to Elvis's early recordings, which would have ensured a steady income. In 1980, a judge ordered an investigation into Parker's management practices and found Parker was unethical.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Meanwhile, his gambling habit increasingly eroded the huge fortune he had built up by claiming over 50% of Presley's earnings, and he died in obscurity worth only $1,000,000.\n\n==Early life==\nParker was born as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk on June 26, 1909 in [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]],<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and was the seventh of eleven children.<ref name=\"Nash11\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|page=11}}</ref> As a boy, he worked as a [[Barker (occupation)|barker]] at carnivals in his hometown, learning many of the skills that he would require later while working in the entertainment industry.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Strauss, Neil|title=Tom Parker is Dead at 87; Controlled Presley's Career|work=New York Times|date= January 22, 1997}}</ref><ref name=\"Victor394\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAt age 15, van Kuijk moved to [[Rotterdam]], gaining employment on boats in the port town.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> At age 17, he first displayed signs of wanting to run away to the [[United States]] to \"make his fortune.\"<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> A year later, with enough money to sustain him for a short period, he entered America illegally by jumping ship from his employer's vessel.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> During his first visit there, he traveled with a [[Chautauqua]] educational tent show, before returning briefly to the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn ''The Colonel'', her biography of Parker, Alanna Nash wrote that there were questions about a murder in Breda in which Parker may have been a suspect or at least a person of interest.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=39\u201351}} This may have motivated him to avoid seeking a passport, as the Netherlands has an active [[extradition]] treaty with the United States, and he may have wanted to avoid criminal arrest by Dutch authorities in that case.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=39\u201351}}\n\nAndreas Cornelis van Kuijk returned to the US at age 20, finding work with carnivals due to his previous experience in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He enlisted in the [[United States Army]], taking the name \"Tom Parker\" from the same name of the officer who interviewed him, to disguise the fact he was an illegal immigrant.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nHe served two years in the [[64th Coast Artillery (United States)]], at [[Fort Shafter]], in [[Hawaii]], and shortly afterwards re-enlisted at [[Fort Barrancas, Florida]].<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Although Parker had served honorably before, he went [[AWOL]] this time and was charged with [[desertion]].<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He was punished with solitary confinement, from which he emerged with a [[psychosis]] that led to him spending two months in a mental hospital,<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and he was discharged from the Army because of his mental condition.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Parker worked at a number of jobs, including food concessions and gaming carnivals.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> From about 1931 until 1938 he worked as a \"[[carny]]\" with [[Royal American Shows]].<ref name=dickerson>{{cite book |last=Dickerson |first=James L.  |date=2003 |title=Colonel Tom Parker: The Curious Life of Elvis Presley's Eccentric Manager |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zeeQUSywek4C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22carl+sedlmayr+jr%22&source=bl&ots=Y5GlQi8aRE&sig=ACfU3U1jAvgD3uv_NrELQiUFKk-mJk_a1A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1k7TlvovmAhXsSBUIHdu7DwEQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22carl%20sedlmayr%20jr%22&f=false |location= |publisher= Cooper Square Press|page=5-7 |isbn=058538827X |author-link=}}</ref> He began to build up a list of contacts that would prove valuable in later years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn 1935, Parker married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.

He had expressed interest in making films when he first met Parker, and now Parker was working to make that happen. He arranged for a screen test with [[Paramount Pictures]], and after impressing them with his acting ability, Presley was signed to a seven-picture contract.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=67}} Parker made sure that the contract allowed Presley the freedom to make at least one film a year with another studio, and also managed to set up an office, with staff, at Paramount. Presley's acting career was originally intended to be a serious one, but after seeing a chance to cross-promote singles and albums with the films, Parker persuaded him to sing in his films. This proved very lucrative, especially when the single for Presley's first film, ''[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]],'' sold over one million copies in advance sales. With 1956 coming to a close, Parker had made Presley one of the most well-known, well-paid entertainers in the world.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=94}}\n\nIn 1957, Parker finally managed to give Tommy Sands his big break by arranging for him to audition for and star in ''The Singin' Idol'', a drama for [[NBC]] that was loosely based on the life and career of Presley.<ref name=nash120/> NBC had originally wanted Presley for the role, but Parker had turned them down.<ref name=nash120/> In the drama the role of Parker was portrayed as a \"twisted psychopath\".<ref name=nash120/> Critics were very positive in their reviews of both the drama and Sands, leading to [[Capitol Records]] signing Sands within a week.<ref name=nash120/> Soon after, Sands' song \"[[Teen-Age Crush]]\" reached number 2 on the pop charts, eventually selling 800,000 copies.<ref name=nash120/>\n\n====Elvis in the Army (1958\u20131960)====\nRegardless of the success that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two.<ref name=\"Vel102\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his [[Conscription|draft notice]] from the United States Army.<ref name=\"Day4\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=95}}</ref> He was upset about the possibility of it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nParker was looking ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had wanted to join [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], allowing him the opportunity to continue to perform while at the same time getting an easier ride than other soldiers.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nWhile Presley was serving in West Germany, Parker was hard at work keeping his name known to the public. He realized that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, he would be able to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction,<ref name=\"Vel106\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.\n\nParker appeared to be in complete control during Presley's time away, but he was worried about the outside influence that Presley might come across in Germany.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Parker had declined to travel to Europe, denying that he spoke any language other than English.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He sent Presley's friends to keep him company, arranged for business associates to watch over him while they were working in Europe, and kept in regular contact with him via telephone and letter.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He was afraid that Presley would realize that there were other managers available, contracts that did not require as much as 25% for his manager. Parker was still worried that Presley would return to nothing, that the public would have found a new star to fawn over by then, and that his golden goose would be reduced to nothing more than a \"has-been.\"<ref name=\"Vel106\"/>\n\n====Elvis returns (1960\u20131965)====\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker had arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=149}}</ref> If Parker had had any doubts about his return, they were soon gone when he witnessed the turnout along the route.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]], who had declared Presley and rock and roll a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show.<ref name=\"Vel112\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=112\u201315}}</ref> Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be {{US$|125000|1960|long=no|about=yes|round=-3}} for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=140}}</ref> but he agreed. The show, entitled \u201cWelcome Home, Elvis\u201d, was Presley's first national television appearance since ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in January 1957.\n\nAfter the Sinatra special, Parker decided that Presley's future lay in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He envisioned him as an entertainment machine, pumping out three films and soundtracks a year, until the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He allowed him to perform three live shows in 1961, all charity events, two in Memphis and one in Hawaii.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> After that, until 1968, Presley gave no live performances, and had very little contact with his fans.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> Parker signed long-term contracts with the film studios,<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> possibly to guarantee work and income for both him and Presley. This was, with hindsight, a mistake on his part; if he had negotiated each deal separately based on the profits of the previous film, he could have received more money.<ref name=\"Vel118\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=118\u2013121}}</ref> Throughout the 1960s Parker would continually renegotiate Presley's film contracts, often paying little attention to the scripts or the thoughts of his client.<ref name=doll139>Doll, ''Elvis for Dummies'', p. 139.</ref> These deals were sometimes so harsh on the studios that it led producer [[Hal Wallis]] to state, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the Devil.\"<ref name=doll139/>\n\nPresley had to do no more than provide RCA with three albums a year,<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no touring or public appearances to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as [[the Beatles]] began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as [[Beatlemania]] began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/>\n\n====Dead ends (1966\u20131967)====\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[The Beach Boys]] dominated the charts. Later in 1983, Parker admitted during an interview that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.\n<ref name=\"Vel127\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=127\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nTo make up for lack of earnings, Parker arranged for Presley's gold Cadillac to go on tour.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Selling it to RCA for $24,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), it was used to promote Presley's latest film, ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1966 film)|Frankie & Johnny]].''<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> In [[Houston]] alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 1967, Parker re-negotiated his managerial/agent contract with Presley, persuading him to increase Parker's share from 25% to 50% on certain transactions. When critics questioned this arrangement and that Parker was exploiting Presley for more money because of greed, Presley quipped \"I could have signed with East Coast Entertainment where they take 70 percent!\"<ref name=\"AZ\">{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Fred|title=Elvis: His Life from A to Z|year=1992|publisher=Outlet|isbn=978-0-517-06634-8|page=149}}</ref> Parker used the argument that Presley was his only client and he was thus earning only one fee.<ref name=\"AZ\"/>\n\nAfter Presley showed signs of rebellion again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker decided that it was time for a new approach: marriage.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Frank Sinatra had married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with [[Priscilla Beaulieu]], ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin \u2013 and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.\n\nParker hoped that marriage would not only boost Presley's career but also possibly tame him.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> With Priscilla's father dropping heavy hints, and fear that their relationship might become public beforehand, Parker persuaded Presley that he should make an \"honest woman\" of her in the very near future. However, it would be a quiet wedding. Parker decided that Las Vegas was the perfect place to do it,<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> and on May 1, 1967, the couple were married in a ceremony that lasted only eight minutes and had a handful of guests.<ref name=\"Vel134\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=134\u2013140}}</ref> A breakfast reception was arranged, taking place after the media got their photographs of the couple.<ref name=\"Vel134\"/>\n\n====The comeback (1968\u20131972)====\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker|Elvis Presley and Parker on a Hollywood film set, 1969]]\nIt took the energetic 1968 television special ''[[Singer Presents...ELVIS|Elvis]]'', which the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that included songs such as \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\" and \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene and the culture in the latter part of the decade had radically changed. The \"Singer Special\" TV show was not intended to turn out the way it did. Parker was adamant that Presley would wear a Santa suit and other holiday garb and sing Christmas songs, as the show was to be broadcast in December 1968. (Several Presley historians have noted the original title for the special was to be ''Elvis and the Wonderful World of Christmas''.) It was the producer of the show, [[Steve Binder]], who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D. J. Fontana]], the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it \"Binder's way.\" This was the first time in the partnership that Presley fully rebelled against Parker.\n\nPresley and Binder's instincts were proven right; the TV special proved an enormous hit, and the album that was released featuring performances from the special became a best-seller. Presley historians have also said doing the special whetted Presley's appetite to perform live again after nearly a decade away from the stage. After the special, Parker managed Presley's return to live performance, including a set of brief U.S. tours and many engagements in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Following the success of Presley's Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), an unheard-of sum at the time. During this part of Presley's career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 \"partnership,\" which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client.\n\nAfter the success of Presley's return to live performing in Las Vegas, Parker decided it was time to take him back out on tour for the first time in 13 years.<ref name=enc384>Victor, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pp. 384\u2013395</ref> The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold.<ref name=enc384/> He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow, so that he and Presley rarely saw each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley.<ref name=enc384/> These live performances, as well as being financially satisfying, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.<ref>Carr & Farren, ''The Complete Illustrated Record''.</ref>\n\nBy 1972, Parker had managed to increase Presley's weekly wage in Las Vegas to $150,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), and secured $50,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for himself as a \"consultant to the hotel chain\".{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Parker had also decided that it was time for Presley to return to New York, and had arranged for him to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]] in June.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Originally planned as three performances, demand was so high that Parker decided to add a fourth performance, making Presley the first performer to sell out the venue four consecutive times. These four shows alone grossed $730,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|730000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}}\n\nOn July 8, 1972, inspired by [[1972 Nixon visit to China|the visit]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] to China a few months earlier,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Careless Love: Unmaking of Elvis Presley|year=1999|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11168-1|pages=}}</ref> Parker announced that there would be a worldwide satellite broadcast from Hawaii to allow the whole world the chance to see a Presley concert, \"since it is impossible for us to play in every major city.\"<ref name=\"Day322\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=}}</ref> (During Presley's career, except for a few concerts in Canada in 1957, he never performed outside the United States.) Parker held another press conference on September 4, 1972 in Las Vegas to confirm that the concert, now titled ''Aloha From Hawaii,'' would be broadcast on January 14, 1973.<ref name=\"Day322\"/> The press were told that an audience of 1 billion was expected to tune in to see the \"first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world,\"<ref name=\"Day322\"/> although Parker had not taken into account the fact that many countries, including parts of Europe and America, would not see the concert live due to the time of the broadcast.<ref name=\"Day322\"/> Two weeks after the Las Vegas press conference Parker received a letter from ''Honolulu Advertiser'' columnist Eddie Sherman.<ref name=\"Gur478\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley|url=https://archive.org/details/carelessloveunma00gural|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-33222-4|pages=}}</ref> Sherman had read in news accounts that there was to be no charge for admittance to the concerts, a donation to charity being required instead. He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded and was still performing the song \"[[I'll Remember You]]\" written by [[Kui Lee]], the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> Seeing the chance to publicize Presley's charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> The album was released simultaneously around the world, and went to number 1 on the US charts, the first Presley album to do so since the ''Roustabout'' soundtrack, in 1964.<ref name=\"Day322\"/>\n\n====Downhill (1973\u20131977)====\n\n=====1973\u20131974=====\n''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'' proved to be the last great moment in Presley's career. In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing dependence on prescription drugs, Presley's father, Vernon, and Parker attempted to cut off his supply.<ref name=doll236>{{cite book|last=Doll|first=Susan|title=Elvis for Dummies|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-47202-6|pages=}}</ref> They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and were successful in stopping any more from reaching Presley.<ref name=doll236/> However, it wasn't long before Presley was able to find other doctors to meet his demands.<ref name=doll236/> In later years, several of Presley's inner circle would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of access to drugs for themselves.<ref name=doll236/> Presley's main doctor, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], would often replace Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> This would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick, he simply found himself other doctors.<ref name=doll236/> Author [[Alanna Nash]] suggests that one of the reasons Parker didn't do more is because he may have just not known how to handle the situation.<ref name=nash229>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 229</ref> In her book, ''The Colonel'', she writes \"in the days before the [[Betty Ford Clinic]], the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out.\"<ref name=nash229/>\n\nAfter the ''Aloha'' special, Parker made a deal that would later be used in court to prove that he had not acted in the best interests of Presley.<ref name=enc384/> He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million.<ref name=enc384/> At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973.<ref name=enc384/> To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement.<ref name=enc384/> Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could never have known how valuable the catalog would become.\n\nFrom 1974 onwards, Presley's weight gain and prescription drug abuse became too much to be controlled.<ref name=\"Nash286\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley |year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press |isbn=978-1-84513-025-1|pages=286\u2013295}}</ref> In Las Vegas he was starting to appear drugged on stage, slurring his words and forgetting song lyrics.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> During a closing night performance on September 3, 1973, following news that a Hilton staff member who Presley was fond of had been fired, he attacked [[Barron Hilton]] in a verbal rage on stage.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> Parker was furious, and he stormed into Presley's dressing room after the show to confront him.

However, other friends and members of Presley's entourage have stood by the suggestion that Parker didn't want to admit there was such a problem because he didn't know how to deal with it, and he was also worried about any negative publicity it would create.<ref name=nash384/> According to Parker himself, he did privately attempt to talk to his client a number of times about the matter, but that allegedly every time Parker casually told Presley to quit or at least tone it down with the pill popping and binge eating, Presley would respond by telling Parker, in a simple but firm tone, to stay out of his personal business.<ref name=nash384/>\n\n=====1975\u20131977=====\nIn February 1975, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Jon Peters]].<ref name=nash384/> They discussed the possibility of Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film'' [[A Star is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]].''<ref name=nash384/> Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, [[Jerry Schilling]], Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge.<ref name=nash384/> Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and 10% of the profits.<ref name=nash384/> Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal.<ref name=nash384/> First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counter-offer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to [[Kris Kristofferson]] who accepted.<ref name=nash384/> Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role.<ref name=nash384/>\n\nLater in 1975, the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] offered Parker $5 million for Presley to perform there.<ref name=nash384/> Parker turned the offer down, and Presley was overjoyed when they replied with another offer of $10 million.<ref name=nash384/> Yet, despite Presley's eagerness to do the shows, Parker again turned them down.<ref name=nash384/> Promoters in South America also made offers, as much as $2.5 million, and all of them were turned down by Parker; \"Well, whenever I need $2.5 million I'll call you\" he once said to them.<ref name=nash384/> Presley was beginning to consider new management, with ''[[Concerts West]]'' co-founder Tom Hulett being the clear favorite for the job.<ref name=nash384/> Hulett's company had managed tours for Presley, and he had worked with artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]]. According to several people who knew Presley at the time, the talks with Hulett got so far along that it seemed almost inevitable the deal would be done. The talks had included details about European tours, and buying out Presley's contract would not have been a problem for Hulett and his company.<ref name=nash384/> Despite this, however, the deal never materialized. According to Presley's biographer [[Peter Guralnick]], Presley and Parker \"were really like, in a sense, a married couple, who started out with great love, loyalty, respect that lasted for a considerable period of time, and went through a number of stages until, towards the end of Presley's life, they should have walked away. None of the rules of the relationship were operative any longer, yet neither had the courage to walk away, for a variety of reasons.\" In any case, Parker remained Presley's manager without a break until Presley's death in 1977.\n\nBy this time, Parker was aware that Presley needed a rest from touring and the chance to deal with his prescription drug addictions.<ref name=nash390>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 290\u2013295.</ref> He phoned Presley's father once to suggest taking time off, but Vernon Presley told him they couldn't afford to stop touring due to Presley's constant and lavish spending of money.<ref name=nash390/> Vernon also threatened to find a new manager if Parker wouldn't continue to tour Presley.<ref name=nash390/>\n\nIn July 1976, three of Presley's personal bodyguards and members of the \"Memphis Mafia\", [[Red West|Robert Gene \"Red\" West]], his cousin [[Sonny West (actor)|Sonny West]] and David Hebler, were fired by Vernon Presley and decided to write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle, entitled ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'' <ref name=nash298>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 298\u2013302</ref> Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the publication of the book. Parker made several attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so.<ref name=nash298/> According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it.<ref name=nash298/> The book would eventually be published one year later on July 12, 1977, one month before Presley's death.\n\nFor the remainder of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale.<ref name=nash298/> Although Parker publicly denied these claims, he had been in talks with [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], manager of [[Led Zeppelin]], about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley.<ref name=nash298/> As with all the talk about Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.\n\n=====Lack of touring abroad=====\nPresley fans have speculated that the reason Presley only performed abroad once during his career, failing to undertake the highly lucrative prospect of touring other countries and continents, may have been that Parker was worried that he would not have been able to acquire a U.S. passport and might even have been deported upon filing his application. In addition, applying for the citizenship required for a US passport would probably have exposed his carefully concealed foreign birth. Although Parker was a US Army veteran and the spouse of an American citizen, one of the basic tenets of U.S. immigration law is that unless an application is made as part of an amnesty program, there are few paths to citizenship or even legal residency for those who entered the country illegally.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Julia|title=Tweak in Rule to Ease a Path to Green Card|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/path-to-green-card-for-illegal-immigrant-family-members-of-americans.html|accessdate=December 19, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> As Parker had not availed himself of the 1940 Alien Registration Act, and there was no amnesty program available to him afterwards, he was not eligible for US citizenship via any means.\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States \u2013 all of them in Canada: [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Vancouver]], during brief tours there in 1957. At the time of those concerts, crossing the US-Canada border did not require a passport. [[Red Robinson]], Vancouver radio icon and MC of the Presley concert in that city, said Parker did not accompany Presley to that show, but instead stayed in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, it is well-established that Parker did not accompany Presley on every tour and every performance date, even in the US, suggesting this may not have been the only rationale for Presley not performing abroad.\n\nRumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an [[Australia]]n tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. Parker ultimately quashed any notions Presley had of working abroad, although Presley did not push the issue, either.<ref>Stanly & Coffey, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', p. 123</ref>\n\nTo cover up Parker's need for questioning in criminal activity, many theories for Presley's lack of touring abroad have surfaced, including the following:\n* Parker's claims that foreign security was poor, relative to the USA.\n* Parker's belief that outside influences (managers, agents etc.) would inform Presley of how unusual his contract with Parker was.\n* Parker's claim that there was a lack of venues large enough to accommodate a star of Presley's stature. All of these excuses were given to Presley when he would show an interest in touring abroad and, known to avoid confrontation, Presley would never argue with Parker.\n* Some promoters wanted to charge fans the equivalent of $100 per ticket. Parker did not wish the fans to be ripped off, and this was another reason he turned down overseas offers.\n\n====Presley's death====\nWhen [[Elvis Presley#Final months and death|Presley died in August 1977]], one day before he was due to go out on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened.<ref name=\"Victor392\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia |year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co Ltd|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=392\u2013393}}</ref> Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered \"oh dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Roy|title=Elvis: The Illustrated Record |year=1982|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53979-9|pages=}}</ref>\n\nParker set out to protect his future income. Asked by a journalist what he would do now, Parker responded, \"Why, I'll just go right on managing him!\"<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Almost immediately, before even visiting Graceland, Parker traveled to New York City to meet with merchandising associates and RCA executives, instructing them to prepare for a huge demand in Presley products.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Shortly afterward, he traveled to Memphis for Presley's funeral. Mourners recall being surprised at his wearing a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap, smoking his trademark cigar, and purposely avoiding the casket.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> At the funeral, he persuaded Presley's father to sign over control of Presley's career in death to him.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/>\n\nIn September 1978, shortly after the first anniversary of Presley's death, Parker arranged a fan festival, ''Always Elvis'', where he, Vernon, and Presley's ex-wife [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla]], dedicated a bronze statue of him in the lobby of the [[Westgate Las Vegas|Las Vegas Hilton]].<ref name=nash315>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 315</ref>\n\n====After Elvis====\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc. Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> It was later revealed that Presley owned 22% of the company, Parker owned 56%, and the final 22% was made up of various business associates.<ref name=\"BMI\"/> Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Presley that gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc. Inc.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, it was discovered that Presley had lost out on royalties for songs on which he had been listed as an author and/or composer because Parker had unwisely advised him not to sign up to [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] or its younger competitor, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].<ref name=\"BMI\">{{cite book|last=Jobe Pierce|first=Patricia|title=The Ultimate Elvis|year=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0-671-87022-5|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateelviselv0000pier}}</ref> Experts in the field at the time estimated that it had potentially cost Presley millions of dollars<ref name=\"BMI\"/> and worse for Parker, it had also potentially cost him those millions of dollars. Parker had unknowingly backed himself into a financial corner.\n\nBy 1980, the cost of running the estate was estimated to be as much as $500,000 a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Priscilla and the Trust were prepared to let Parker continue to handle Presley's business affairs, and petitioned the court to that end.<ref name=\"Gaar240\">{{cite book|last=Gaar|first=Gillian G|title=Return of The King: Elvis Presley's Great Comeback|year=2010|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-28-2|pages=}}</ref> However, Judge Joseph Evans, aware that [[Lisa Marie Presley]] was still a minor, appointed attorney Blanchard E. Tual to investigate Parker's management.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Tual, once appointed as Lisa Marie's ''guardian ad litem'', chose to investigate the entire period of Parker's management of Presley; his preliminary finding was that Parker's management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15\u201320%.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He also noted that Parker's handling of Presley's business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, was \"unethical\" and poorly handled.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> During a second, more detailed investigation, Tual discovered that all earnings were paid directly to the Trust instead of Parker.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nOn August 14, 1981, Judge Evans ordered EPE to sue Parker for mismanagement.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> In response to this, Parker countersued.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}})<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> in exchange for all Presley audio recordings or visual images that he owned<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and the termination of his involvement in any Presley related earnings for five years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nParker had worked as a \"consultant\" for [[Hilton Hotels]] since Presley's death,<ref name=\"Nash328\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|pages=328\u2013335}}</ref> with some believing he was working to pay off debts owed to the casino from his gambling during Presley's performances there.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> Part of this role resulted in Parker keeping the same fourth-floor suite he occupied when Presley was alive, but by 1984, with his gambling debts reportedly rising again, he was evicted.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> On the surface, however, relations between the two were as good as ever, with Parker helping the Hilton to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Presley's death.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nThe disputes with the Presley estate did not terminate his association with his most high-profile client. Parker appeared at posthumous events honoring Presley, such as the 1993 issuing of the [[United States Postal Service]] stamp honoring the King of Rock and Roll. He also became friendly with the estate again, attending special ceremonies and events in Memphis, invited by Priscilla.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> However, he did occasionally step on their toes by commenting negatively on some of their decisions. In 1994, following the marriage of Lisa Marie and Michael Jackson, Parker stated that Presley would not have approved,<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> and in 1993, interest in Presley's enduring legend, interest that is sometimes notable for its obsessiveness, provoked Parker to remark, \"I don't think I exploited Elvis as much as he's being exploited today.\"<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nIn 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\nAs Presley's fame grew, people became interested in Parker as well. For a time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming to have been born in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], West Virginia, (to explain his Dutch accent as being a Southern accent) and to have run away at an early age to join a circus run by an uncle. The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the [[Netherlands]], recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley <ref>https://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/elvis-presley-col-tom-parker.html</ref>.\n\nOne of Parker's brothers, Adam \"Ad\" van Kuijk, visited Parker once in [[Los Angeles]] in April 1961. Parker privately acknowledged his brother and introduced him to Presley. During the week-long visit, Parker was informed by Adam van Kuijk that their mother had died three years earlier in 1958, never knowing what happened to her son after he left the Netherlands for good in 1929. Adam van Kuijk later died from emphysema in 1992, never seeing or visiting Parker again.<ref>https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/andreas-van-kuijk.shtml</ref>\n\nThe claim of Parker's Dutch heritage was publicly confirmed when Parker tried to avert a lawsuit brought against him in 1982 by asserting in open court that he was a Dutch citizen. In 1993, in one of his last media appearances, Parker appeared in a television interview with Dutch TV director [[Jorrit van der Kooi]] where they spoke to each other in Dutch about the Netherlands and about Elvis Presley's life and career. During the interview, Parker said that he was not aware that another one of his sisters, named Adriana van Kuijk, had died in the Netherlands a few years before.\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.<ref name=\"Vellenga\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and The Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Marie was one of six children,<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> had been married twice before, and had a son from her first marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> Unbeknownst to Parker at the time, she had a second son from her first marriage, but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability (a [[club foot]]).{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=71}} Some have suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the US;<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> a marriage to a US citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\".<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> However, there is no definite proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/>\n\nOthers, however, have doubts about whether they were legally married at all.<ref name=\"Nash\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|ref=harv|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> According to interviews given by Parker to the [[Associated Press]] many years later, he and Marie were married in [[Tampa, Florida]] during the winter of 1932,<ref name=\"Nash\"/> but the Florida Office of Vital Statistics has no record of such a marriage any time between 1927 and 1946.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> It is also recorded that Marie did not divorce her second husband until 1936, and her brother, [[Bitsy Mott|Bitsy]], recalls no ceremony of marriage between Parker and Marie.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> Author Alanna Nash suggests the couple may have simply placed their hands on a Bible and given themselves a \"carny wedding\".<ref name=\"Nash\"/>\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked together in the carnivals.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country. During the 1960s, after many years of ill health, Marie began to display signs of [[dementia]].{{sfn|Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} Parker began to distance himself from her, heartbroken by her slow mental deterioration from the woman he once knew.{{sfn|Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} Marie died in November 1986 of [[Post-concussion syndrome|chronic brain syndrome]] at age 78.{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=329}} In October 1990, Parker married Loanne Miller, his secretary since 1972.{{sfn |Nash|2002|pp=276\u2013277}} From then on, he continued living in Las Vegas, mostly avoiding contact with the press.\n\n===Gambling===\nMany Parker biographers, including Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, have stated that Parker's gambling habit really began to get out of control in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> During the 1960s, with his wife's health deteriorating, and Presley's career struggling, Parker found an escape with gambling at Las Vegas casinos.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> Fans and biographers alike believe that one of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover losses he experienced in their casino.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He would often spend 12\u201314 hours at a time gambling, betting large sums instead of small amounts.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> At the time of Presley's death it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton over $30 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30000000|1977}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> After a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, Parker's estate was barely worth $1 million when he died.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\n\"Colonel Tom Parker rubbed my head in Vegas,\" [[Eddie Murphy]] stated in 1989. \"A couple times he set me up in the Elvis Presley suite on top of [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino|the Hilton]], and I would go play Elvis for a week\u2026 One night we were at the [[Craps|crap table]] together and he rubbed my head for luck.

In the scene, Parker is satirically portrayed as a gluttonous, satanic figure. The scene contrasts Parker's management of Elvis with the freedom Epstein allows the Beatles. The scene also portrays Parker as [[anti-semitic]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Oregon Convention Center Aerial Shot (34293717672).jpg|thumb|left|The Oregon Convention Center with the Rose Quarter and Broadway Bridge in the background, 2017]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

According to the ideology of Varuzhan and his followers, the Christian ideology of \"[[Turn the other cheek|turning the cheek]]\" has become a disaster for the Armenian nation, which before was a great nation with brave soldiers and wise rulers.

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself.

To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the assyrian queen.\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D5%8A%D5%A1%D6%80_%D4%B3%D5%A1%D5%BC%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "text_old": "{{sidebar\n|name = Armenian Native Faith\n|title = [[Hetanism]]<br />and [[Armenian mythology]]\n|image = [[File:Left-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign UC 058E SVG.svg|150px]]\n|caption = Arevakhach, symbol of hetanism\n|captionstyle = font-style:italic\n|headingstyle = background:#B0CBAC\n|contentclass = hlist\n\n|heading1 = Practices\n|content1 =\n* [[Pantheism]]\n* Semi-[[Polytheistic]] [[Monotheism]]\n* [[Matagh]]\n* [[Knunk]]\n* [[Vardavar]]\n* [[Fire worship]]\n* [[List of water deities|Water woship]]\n* [[Veneration of the dead|Worship of ancestors]]\n\n|heading2 = Places\n|content2 =\n* [[Garni temple]]\n* [[Zorats qarer]]\n* [[Khustup mountain]]\n\n|heading3 = Deities and beings\n|content3 =\n* Ar\n* [[Hayk]] (Aramazd)\n* [[Anahit]]\n* [[Vahagn]]\n* [[Tir]]\n* [[Mihr]]\n* [[Vanatur]]\n* [[Ara the Beautiful]]\n* [[Turk' Angegh]]\n* [[Nane]]\n* [[Astghik]]\n* [[Spandaramet]]\n* [[Barshamin]]\n|heading4 = Ancient Sources\n|content4 =\n* [[Moses of Chorene]]\n* [[Anania Shirakatsi]]\n* [[Ukhtagirq]]\n\n}}\n'''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0540\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 ''Hetanosutiwn'') or '''Armenian native faith''', was the dominant<ref name=\"Romeny 2010\">{{Cite book|last=Romeny|first=R.

According to the ideology of Varuzhan and his followers, the Christian ideology of \"[[Turn the other cheek|turning the cheek]]\" has become a disaster for the Armenian nation, which before was a great nation with brave soldiers and wise rulers.

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky. \nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik, Astlik\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Astghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself.

To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on August 11, 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the assyrian queen.\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D5%8A%D5%A1%D6%80_%D4%B3%D5%A1%D5%BC%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "name_user": "Dl2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "repair template damage; tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Native_Faith"}

The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.

The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.

Flyting can also be found in [[Arabic poetry]] in a popular form called ''naq\u0101\u2019i\u1e0d'', as well as the competitive verses of Japanese [[Haikai]].\n\nEchoes of the genre continue into modern poetry. [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s poem ''[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]'', for example, has many passages of flyting in which the poet's opponent is, in effect, the rest of humanity.\n\nFlyting is similar in both form and function to the modern practice of [[freestyle battle]]s between rappers and the historic practice of [[the Dozens]], a verbal-combat game representing a synthesis of flyting and its [[Early Modern English]] descendants with comparable African verbal-combat games such as ''Ikocha Nkocha''.<ref name=\"rap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3998862/Rap-music-originated-in-medieval-Scottish-pubs-claims-American-professor.html |title=Rap music originated in medieval Scottish pubs, claims American professor |accessdate=2008-12-30 |last=Johnson |first=Simon |work=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2008-12-28 |quote=Professor Ferenc Szasz argued that so-called [[rap battles]], where two or more performers trade elaborate insults, derive from the ancient Caledonian art of \"flyting.\" According to the theory, Scottish slave owners took the tradition with them to the United States, where it was adopted and developed by slaves, emerging many years later as rap; see also John Dollard, \"The Dozens: the dialect of insult\", ''American Image'' '''1''' (1939), pp 3-24; Roger D.

Flyting can also be found in [[Arabic poetry]] in a popular form called ''naq\u0101\u2019i\u1e0d'', as well as the competitive verses of Japanese [[Haikai]].\n\nEchoes of the genre continue into modern poetry. [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s poem ''[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]'', for example, has many passages of flyting in which the poet's opponent is, in effect, the rest of humanity.\n\nFlyting is similar in both form and function to the modern practice of [[freestyle battle]]s between rappers and the historic practice of [[the Dozens]], a verbal-combat game representing a synthesis of flyting and its [[Early Modern English]] descendants with comparable African verbal-combat games such as ''Ikocha Nkocha''.<ref name=\"rap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3998862/Rap-music-originated-in-medieval-Scottish-pubs-claims-American-professor.html |title=Rap music originated in medieval Scottish pubs, claims American professor |accessdate=2008-12-30 |last=Johnson |first=Simon |work=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2008-12-28 |quote=Professor Ferenc Szasz argued that so-called [[rap battles]], where two or more performers trade elaborate insults, derive from the ancient Caledonian art of \"flyting.\" According to the theory, Scottish slave owners took the tradition with them to the United States, where it was adopted and developed by slaves, emerging many years later as rap; see also John Dollard, \"The Dozens: the dialect of insult\", ''American Image'' '''1''' (1939), pp 3-24; Roger D. Abrahams, \"Playing the dozens\", ''Journal of American Folklore'' '''75''' (1962), pp 209-18.}}</ref>\n\nIn Finnic [[Kalevala]] the hero [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]] uses similar practice of ''kilpalaulanta'' (duel singing) to win opposing [[Joukahainen]].\n\n==Modern portrayals==\nIn \"[[The Roaring Trumpet]]\", part of Harold Shea's introduction to the Norse gods is a flyting between Heimdall and Loki in which Heimdall utters the immortal line \"All insults are untrue. I state facts.\"\n\nThe climactic scene in [[Rick Riordan]]'s novel ''[[The Ship of the Dead]]'' consists of a flyting between the protagonist [[Magnus Chase]] and the Norse god Loki.\n\n== Recreation ==\nIn a May 2010 episode of the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Time Team]]'', archaeologists [[Matt Williams (archaeologist)|Matt Williams]] and [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] engage in some mock flyting in [[Old English]] written by Saxon historian [[Sam Newton]] to demonstrate the practice.

Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated.

The most common cancers of the stomach are [[adenocarcinomas]] but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. In order to determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasound may be performed. [[Gastroscopy]], a test using an instrument called endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.<ref name=MacEwan_2001>{{cite book|veditors=Withrow SJ, MacEwen EG |title=Small Animal Clinical Oncology|edition=3rd|publisher=W.B.

Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the [[muscularis mucosae]], the [[submucosa]] and then the [[muscularis propria]]. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. [[Linitis plastica|Diffuse type]] adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, [[linitis plastica]] or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumour cell, it pushes the nucleus to the periphery: \"''[[signet-ring cell]]''\".\n* Around 5% of gastric cancers are [[lymphomas]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kumar|2010|p=786}}</ref> These may include [[Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma#Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma|extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas]] (MALT type)<ref name=Bur2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burkitt MD, Duckworth CA, Williams JM, Pritchard DM | title = Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric pathology: insights from in vivo and ex vivo models | journal = Disease Models & Mechanisms | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 89\u2013104 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28151409 | pmc = 5312008 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.027649 | url = }}</ref> and to a lesser extent [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s.<ref name=\"pmid25052386\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Qu Q, Xuan W, Fan GH | title = Roles of resolvins in the resolution of acute inflammation | journal = Cell Biology International | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u201322 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25052386 | doi = 10.1002/cbin.10345 | url = }}</ref> MALT type make up about half of stomach lymphomas.<ref name=St2010/>\n* [[Carcinoid]] and stromal tumors may occur.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Adenocarcinoma low differentiated (stomach) H&E magn 400x.jpg|Poor to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
