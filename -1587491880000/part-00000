The station has four tracks, three [[island platform]]s, and one [[side platform]] (originally two).\n\nThe southbound platform is slightly higher at the southern end of the station because the next stop south, [[Fulton Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Fulton Street]], is bi-level with the southbound platform being above the northern one. The two \"express\" tracks, currently unused in regular revenue service, merge into a single tail track south of the station. The tail track is {{convert|620|ft}} long from the switch points to the [[bumper block]], where an emergency exit is available. The tail track south of the station was the site of a train crash on November 6, 2007.<ref>[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], [http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/m-train-incident-chambers-street M Train Incident at Chambers Street], November 6, 2007</ref>\n\nNorth of this station, there are two stub tracks, which end behind the now-closed Queens-bound side platform.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V69X72HAZ1g ''The provisions for 2 tracks are clearly visible towards the right at the 3:11 mark, just after the train leaves the Chambers Street station.''</ref><ref>http://ltvsquad.com/2005/07/04/marginalized/</ref> These tracks were formerly connected to the [[Manhattan Bridge]], until they were disconnected in 1967 as part of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]], with the [[BMT Broadway Line]] being connected to the bridge instead. Also north of this station, the former southbound express track (now the northbound track) splits into two tracks just south of [[Canal Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Canal Street]]: the former northbound local track, and the former southbound express track (the current northbound track).\n\nThe tile work on this station includes a depiction of the nearby [[Brooklyn Bridge]] that has a subtle mistake: it features the parallel up-down cables between the main cable and the roadway (as seen alone on most suspension bridges) but misses the second set of diagonal cables that radiate from the bridge to the roadway (as seen on [[cable-stayed bridge]]s).\n\n=== History ===\nWhen it was being built before [[World War I]], Chambers Street was designed to be the BMT's Manhattan hub, with trains arriving from Brooklyn in both directions, and terminating here. It was envisioned as a [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] terminal, a kind of downtown [[Grand Central Terminal]] at a time when the business and population center of the city was still closer to the southern end of the island. Three years after the Chambers Street station opened, its four wide platforms were so overcrowded that one newspaper article described them as \"more dangerous during the rush hours than at the Grand Central or the Fourteenth Street Stations.\"<ref name=\"nyt 200305\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/nyregion/tunnel-vision-they-re-subway-experts-take-their-word-on-what-s-ugly.html|title=TUNNEL VISION; They're Subway Experts.

The loop configuration permitted trains arriving in either direction from the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] in Brooklyn to pass through Chambers Street and return to Fourth Avenue without having to reverse direction. The [[BMT Brooklyn Loops]], a track connection to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] that would have connected to the Williamsburg Bridge tracks, was planned in the station's design, but was only partially built. The finished portions of the tunnel to the Brooklyn Bridge led directly to wine vaults under the bridge.<ref>https://untappedcities.com/2018/05/24/inside-the-champagne-vaults-of-the-brooklyn-bridge-on-the-135th-anniversary-photos/</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, the subway itself was pushing the city's population north and leaving Chambers Street behind. The [[Nassau Street Loop]] was completed in 1931, making Chambers Street a through station south to the [[Montague Street Tunnel]] to [[Brooklyn]]. At this point, the center island platform and the two side platforms were closed. By the 1950s, many of the city's business interests had shifted to [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]]. The west side platform was walled up and most of it was destroyed when [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] was rebuilt on the other side of the wall in 1960\u201362. The [[Chrystie Street Connection]], completed in 1967, severed the Nassau line's connection to the Manhattan Bridge, so that the bridge tracks could connect instead to the uptown [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]. The tracks heading towards the Manhattan Bridge (now used for train storage) are visible from northbound trains leaving Chambers Street.\n\nAlthough altered over the years to account for changing ridership patterns, the station has not been renovated. In a 2003 poll, it was voted the ugliest station in the system.<ref name=\"nyt 200305\" /> In May 2018, it was announced that the MTA would start renovating the Chambers Street station that August. The station will receive two platform elevators and three new ramps in the mezzanine. One ramp will allow passengers using the Chambers Street mezzanine to use the street elevator in the Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall station. The two other ramps will lead to the two platform elevators. The station platforms will be modified to reduce the gap between trains and the platform edges, and a pedestrian bridge will be installed above the tracks, connecting both of the open platforms. To accommodate the ramps, elevators, and pedestrian bridge, portions of the station and mezzanine will need to be removed or reconfigured. These improvements will make the station compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/05/25/mta-overhauling-forgotten-subway-station-after-post-report/|title=MTA overhauling \u2018forgotten\u2019 subway station after Post report|date=May 25, 2018|work=New York Post|access-date=May 28, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> and are being funded as part of the 2015\u20132019 MTA Capital Program.<ref name=\"Capital Plan 2015-2019\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capital/pdf/CapitalProgram2015-19_WEB%20v4%20FINAL_small.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program 2015\u20132019: Renew.

This is the southern [[terminal station|terminal]] for the 6 train, which turns via the [[City Hall Loop (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|City Hall Loop]] to head back uptown.\n\nThe station has been renovated, with new tile and [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] elevator access. It is the zero point for the [[New York City Subway chaining|IRT East Side chain]]; mile 0 is at the south end of the station.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge station has a number of closed off areas as construction and service patterns have required changes to be made to the station. In addition to the two [[island platform]]s, there are two short [[side platform]]s on the outer edges of the station. Like those on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]] and on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] at [[96th Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]], these side platforms were built to accommodate extra passenger volume and were built to the five-car length of the original [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] local trains. These platforms did not see much use as they were located at express stations, which allow [[cross-platform interchange]]s via the island platforms. When trains were lengthened to their current ten-car length, it was impractical to lengthen both these side platforms and the island platforms. They were closed in 1910 after only six years in operation and walled off along the platform edges.\n\nThe side platform on the southbound side is now home to some electrical equipment and a backup [[railroad tower|control tower]] for the Brooklyn Bridge [[interlocking]], just north of the station. The tower is functional but not normally used, because the [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]] tower is the primary control point for the whole line. The interlocking board can be seen through a window along the wall along the southbound local trackway. The south end of the downtown side platform is still visible near the dispatcher's booth on the downtown island platform.\n\nThere are also some closed portions at the south ends of the existing express platforms that feature [[Gap filler|gap fillers]] and original mosaic tiles. During previous station lengthening projects, it was deemed easier to lengthen the express platform northward, as the curves at the south end proved impossible to rework. The lengthening resulted in the closure of [[Worth Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Worth Street]], the closure of the curved southern ends of the express platforms, and the demolition of the western side platform at Chambers Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line.\n\nArtwork includes a 1996 work by [[Mark Gibian]] titled ''Cable Crossing''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=J&artist=1&station=20|title=Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall/Chamber Street MARK GIBIAN Cable Crossing, 1996|website=web.mta.info|publisher=MTA Arts & Design|language=en|access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nThis station was constructed as part of the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first IRT line]] between 1900 and 1904.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/03/25/102581493.pdf|title=Rapid Transit Tunnel Begun \u2014 Ground Officially Broken by the Mayor with a Silver Spade \u2014 Felicitations and Speeches \u2014 Ceremonies Witnessed by Immense Unruly Crowd Eager for Souvenirs.|last=|first=|date=March 25, 1900|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=November 11, 2016|page=2}}</ref> This station opened on October 27, 1904, along the rest of the line from City Hall to 145th Street.<ref name=\"145th\" /> Express trains were extended south on January 16, 1905, when a {{Convert|0.3|miles|km}}-long extension to Fulton Street opened at 12:01&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/01/14/101318642.pdf|title=Fulton St. Trains Monday \u2014 New Style of Subway Platform Will Be Tried There|last=|first=|date=January 14, 1905|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 11, 2016|page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority undertook a $138 million modernization project for the Lexington Avenue Line. As part of the project, platforms at Brooklyn Bridge were extended. Work on the reconstruction of the Brooklyn Bridge station started on May 18, 1959 and continued without interruption until it was completed on September 1, 1962. Prior to the rebuild, the station's local platform could only accommodate four cars, resulting in delays. The uptown platform's extension opened at this time (the downtown platform was lengthened in 1961) as the platforms were lengthened, widened, and straightened. Originally, the island platforms narrowed at their northern ends to an unsafe width of only five feet. The project remedied this situation, lengthening the platforms from 295 feet to 523 feet and widening them. The platforms were extended northward by {{Convert|220|feet|meters}} to just south of Reade Street. In addition, a new exit was provided at Reade Street and Lafayette Street and a new passageway under Reade Street was built connecting to the Chambers Street station on the BMT Nassau Street Line. At the center of the enlarged platforms, a new overhead passage was built, providing more direct access to the [[Manhattan Municipal Building|Municipal Building]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|title=Annual Report For The Year Ended June 30, 1959|date=October 1959|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|page=9}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E3DA173CE53BBC4953DFBF668389679EDE|title=New Platform for IRT Locals At Brooklyn Bridge to End Jams; Sharp Curve on Northbound Side Removed Station Extended to Worth St.|last=|first=|date=September 1, 1962|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe platform extensions allowed the old platform extensions at the southern end of the station, which were used for express service, to be abandoned. These platform extensions had necessitated the use of gap fillers. This project cost $6 million, and allowed 6 trains to be lengthened to nine cars, and allowed express trains to open all doors at the station (previously the doors only opened in eight of the ten cars). Upon its completion, the [[Worth Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Worth Street]] station to the north was closed due to its close proximity to the platform extensions, and, as such, the station was renamed Brooklyn Bridge\u2013Worth Street.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter Worth Street station closed, the Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall station was known as ''Brooklyn Bridge\u2013Worth Street''. The name was reverted to ''Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall'' in 1995.\n\n=== Track layout ===\nJust north of the station are crossovers that allow trains to switch between the local and express tracks, which allow Lexington Avenue local trains to continue south via the express tracks if necessary (rather than using the City Hall loop). Due to the closure of City Hall station in 1945, Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (which had simply been Brooklyn Bridge) became the southernmost station on normal Lexington Avenue local service.\n\nSouth of the station, the downtown local track splits into three tracks. The westernmost track loops around to the northbound local track through City Hall station. The other two are layup tracks parallel to the downtown express track. Until 1963, they merged into the downtown express track north of [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]], but now they end at [[bumper block]]s a little north of Fulton Street, and are occasionally used for train storage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1963|title=IRT Lexington Ave. Trackage To Be Changed|url=https://issuu.com/erausa/docs/1963-03-jun-bulletin|journal=The New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=6|issue=3|pages=6|via=Issue}}</ref>\n\n===Exits===\nAll of the IRT station's exits are shared with the BMT station via a passageway.

The station has four tracks, three [[island platform]]s, and one [[side platform]] (originally two).\n\nThe southbound platform is slightly higher at the southern end of the station because the next stop south, [[Fulton Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Fulton Street]], is bi-level with the southbound platform being above the northern one. The two \"express\" tracks, currently unused in regular revenue service, merge into a single tail track south of the station. The tail track is {{convert|620|ft}} long from the switch points to the [[bumper block]], where an emergency exit is available. The tail track south of the station was the site of a train crash on November 6, 2007.<ref>[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], [http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/m-train-incident-chambers-street M Train Incident at Chambers Street], November 6, 2007</ref>\n\nNorth of this station, there are two stub tracks, which end behind the now-closed Queens-bound side platform.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V69X72HAZ1g ''The provisions for 2 tracks are clearly visible towards the right at the 3:11 mark, just after the train leaves the Chambers Street station.''</ref><ref>http://ltvsquad.com/2005/07/04/marginalized/</ref> These tracks were formerly connected to the [[Manhattan Bridge]], until they were disconnected in 1967 as part of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]], with the [[BMT Broadway Line]] being connected to the bridge instead. Also north of this station, the former southbound express track (now the northbound track) splits into two tracks just south of [[Canal Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Canal Street]]: the former northbound local track, and the former southbound express track (the current northbound track).\n\nThe tile work on this station includes a depiction of the nearby [[Brooklyn Bridge]] that has a subtle mistake: it features the parallel up-down cables between the main cable and the roadway (as seen alone on most suspension bridges) but misses the second set of diagonal cables that radiate from the bridge to the roadway (as seen on [[cable-stayed bridge]]s).\n\n=== History ===\nWhen it was being built before [[World War I]], Chambers Street was designed to be the BMT's Manhattan hub, with trains arriving from Brooklyn in both directions, and terminating here. It was envisioned as a [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] terminal, a kind of downtown [[Grand Central Terminal]] at a time when the business and population center of the city was still closer to the southern end of the island. Three years after the Chambers Street station opened, its four wide platforms were so overcrowded that one newspaper article described them as \"more dangerous during the rush hours than at the Grand Central or the Fourteenth Street Stations.\"<ref name=\"nyt 200305\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/nyregion/tunnel-vision-they-re-subway-experts-take-their-word-on-what-s-ugly.html|title=TUNNEL VISION; They're Subway Experts.

The loop configuration permitted trains arriving in either direction from the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] in Brooklyn to pass through Chambers Street and return to Fourth Avenue without having to reverse direction. The [[BMT Brooklyn Loops]], a track connection to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] that would have connected to the Williamsburg Bridge tracks, was planned in the station's design, but was only partially built. The finished portions of the tunnel to the Brooklyn Bridge led directly to wine vaults under the bridge.<ref>https://untappedcities.com/2018/05/24/inside-the-champagne-vaults-of-the-brooklyn-bridge-on-the-135th-anniversary-photos/</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, the subway itself was pushing the city's population north and leaving Chambers Street behind. The [[Nassau Street Loop]] was completed in 1931, making Chambers Street a through station south to the [[Montague Street Tunnel]] to [[Brooklyn]]. At this point, the center island platform and the two side platforms were closed. By the 1950s, many of the city's business interests had shifted to [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]]. The west side platform was walled up and most of it was destroyed when [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] was rebuilt on the other side of the wall in 1960\u201362. The [[Chrystie Street Connection]], completed in 1967, severed the Nassau line's connection to the Manhattan Bridge, so that the bridge tracks could connect instead to the uptown [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]. The tracks heading towards the Manhattan Bridge (now used for train storage) are visible from northbound trains leaving Chambers Street.\n\nAlthough altered over the years to account for changing ridership patterns, the station has not been renovated. In a 2003 poll, it was voted the ugliest station in the system.<ref name=\"nyt 200305\" /> In May 2018, it was announced that the MTA would start renovating the Chambers Street station that August. The station will receive two platform elevators and three new ramps in the mezzanine. One ramp will allow passengers using the Chambers Street mezzanine to use the street elevator in the Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall station. The two other ramps will lead to the two platform elevators. The station platforms will be modified to reduce the gap between trains and the platform edges, and a pedestrian bridge will be installed above the tracks, connecting both of the open platforms. To accommodate the ramps, elevators, and pedestrian bridge, portions of the station and mezzanine will need to be removed or reconfigured.

This is the southern [[terminal station|terminal]] for the 6 train, which turns via the [[City Hall Loop (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|City Hall Loop]] to head back uptown.\n\nThe station has been renovated, with new tile and [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] elevator access. It is the zero point for the [[New York City Subway chaining|IRT East Side chain]]; mile 0 is at the south end of the station.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge station has a number of closed off areas as construction and service patterns have required changes to be made to the station. In addition to the two [[island platform]]s, there are two short [[side platform]]s on the outer edges of the station. Like those on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]] and on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] at [[96th Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]], these side platforms were built to accommodate extra passenger volume and were built to the five-car length of the original [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] local trains. These platforms did not see much use as they were located at express stations, which allow [[cross-platform interchange]]s via the island platforms. When trains were lengthened to their current ten-car length, it was impractical to lengthen both these side platforms and the island platforms. They were closed in 1910 after only six years in operation and walled off along the platform edges.\n\nThe side platform on the southbound side is now home to some electrical equipment and a backup [[railroad tower|control tower]] for the Brooklyn Bridge [[interlocking]], just north of the station. The tower is functional but not normally used, because the [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]] tower is the primary control point for the whole line. The interlocking board can be seen through a window along the wall along the southbound local trackway. The south end of the downtown side platform is still visible near the dispatcher's booth on the downtown island platform.\n\nThere are also some closed portions at the south ends of the existing express platforms that feature [[Gap filler|gap fillers]] and original mosaic tiles. During previous station lengthening projects, it was deemed easier to lengthen the express platform northward, as the curves at the south end proved impossible to rework. The lengthening resulted in the closure of [[Worth Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Worth Street]], the closure of the curved southern ends of the express platforms, and the demolition of the western side platform at Chambers Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line.\n\nArtwork includes a 1996 work by [[Mark Gibian]] titled ''Cable Crossing''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=J&artist=1&station=20|title=Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall/Chamber Street MARK GIBIAN Cable Crossing, 1996|website=web.mta.info|publisher=MTA Arts & Design|language=en|access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nThis station was constructed as part of the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first IRT line]] between 1900 and 1904.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/03/25/102581493.pdf|title=Rapid Transit Tunnel Begun \u2014 Ground Officially Broken by the Mayor with a Silver Spade \u2014 Felicitations and Speeches \u2014 Ceremonies Witnessed by Immense Unruly Crowd Eager for Souvenirs.|last=|first=|date=March 25, 1900|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=November 11, 2016|page=2}}</ref> This station opened on October 27, 1904, along the rest of the line from City Hall to 145th Street.<ref name=\"145th\" /> Express trains were extended south on January 16, 1905, when a {{Convert|0.3|miles|km}}-long extension to Fulton Street opened at 12:01&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/01/14/101318642.pdf|title=Fulton St. Trains Monday \u2014 New Style of Subway Platform Will Be Tried There|last=|first=|date=January 14, 1905|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 11, 2016|page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority undertook a $138 million modernization project for the Lexington Avenue Line. As part of the project, platforms at Brooklyn Bridge were extended. Work on the reconstruction of the Brooklyn Bridge station started on May 18, 1959 and continued without interruption until it was completed on September 1, 1962. Prior to the rebuild, the station's local platform could only accommodate four cars, resulting in delays. The uptown platform's extension opened at this time (the downtown platform was lengthened in 1961) as the platforms were lengthened, widened, and straightened. Originally, the island platforms narrowed at their northern ends to an unsafe width of only five feet. The project remedied this situation, lengthening the platforms from 295 feet to 523 feet and widening them. The platforms were extended northward by {{Convert|220|feet|meters}} to just south of Reade Street. In addition, a new exit was provided at Reade Street and Lafayette Street and a new passageway under Reade Street was built connecting to the Chambers Street station on the BMT Nassau Street Line. At the center of the enlarged platforms, a new overhead passage was built, providing more direct access to the [[Manhattan Municipal Building|Municipal Building]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|title=Annual Report For The Year Ended June 30, 1959|date=October 1959|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|page=9}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E3DA173CE53BBC4953DFBF668389679EDE|title=New Platform for IRT Locals At Brooklyn Bridge to End Jams; Sharp Curve on Northbound Side Removed Station Extended to Worth St.|last=|first=|date=September 1, 1962|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe platform extensions allowed the old platform extensions at the southern end of the station, which were used for express service, to be abandoned. These platform extensions had necessitated the use of gap fillers. This project cost $6 million, and allowed 6 trains to be lengthened to nine cars, and allowed express trains to open all doors at the station (previously the doors only opened in eight of the ten cars). Upon its completion, the [[Worth Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Worth Street]] station to the north was closed due to its close proximity to the platform extensions, and, as such, the station was renamed Brooklyn Bridge\u2013Worth Street.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter Worth Street station closed, the Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall station was known as ''Brooklyn Bridge\u2013Worth Street''. The name was reverted to ''Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall'' in 1995.\n\n=== Track layout ===\nJust north of the station are crossovers that allow trains to switch between the local and express tracks, which allow Lexington Avenue local trains to continue south via the express tracks if necessary (rather than using the City Hall loop). Due to the closure of City Hall station in 1945, Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (which had simply been Brooklyn Bridge) became the southernmost station on normal Lexington Avenue local service.\n\nSouth of the station, the downtown local track splits into three tracks. The westernmost track loops around to the northbound local track through City Hall station. The other two are layup tracks parallel to the downtown express track. Until 1963, they merged into the downtown express track north of [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]], but now they end at [[bumper block]]s a little north of Fulton Street, and are occasionally used for train storage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1963|title=IRT Lexington Ave. Trackage To Be Changed|url=https://issuu.com/erausa/docs/1963-03-jun-bulletin|journal=The New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=6|issue=3|pages=6|via=Issue}}</ref>\n\n===Exits===\nAll of the IRT station's exits are shared with the BMT station via a passageway.
