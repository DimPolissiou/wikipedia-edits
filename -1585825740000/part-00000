He eventually joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1964. Vijayan became Kannur district secretary of the Kerala Students Federation (KSF), which later became the [[Students Federation of India]] (SFI). He went on to become the state secretary and subsequently the state president of KSF. He then moved on to Kerala State Youth Federation (KSYF), which later became the [[Democratic Youth Federation of India]] (DYFI). He became the president of the state committee. During that period, when communists in Kerala were organising the political activities from different hide-outs, Pinarayi Vijayan was imprisoned for one and a half years.\n\nLater he was elected as the president of the Kerala state co-operative bank. During the emergency, he was arrested and tortured by police. He became the [[Kannur]] district secretary of the CPI(M) when [[M.V. Raghavan]] left the party over the \u2018alternative document' row. Within three years, he became a member of the State Secretariat. He was elected to the Assembly in 1970, 1977 and 1991 from [[Kuthuparamba (State Assembly constituency)|Kuthuparamba]], in 1996 from [[Payyanur (State Assembly constituency)|Payyanur]] and in 2016 from [[Dharmadom (State Assembly constituency)|Dharmadom]].

Despite initial problems with censorship, it was revived on the French stage several times after its original production, and in 1948 a [[Les Parents terribles (film)|film adaptation]] directed by Cocteau was released.  English-language versions have been produced under various titles including ''Intimate Relations'' and ''Indiscretions''.\n\n==History==\nIn January 1938 Cocteau wanted to concentrate on writing a new play and left Paris to stay in Montargis, accompanied by [[Jean Marais]]. A concentrated period of work led to the completion of the text by the end of February. Its title was then ''La Roulotte ou la maison dans la lune'' (\"The caravan or the house on the moon\"), referring to the negligent way of life of certain characters, and the unrealistic attitude of others. Cocteau intended the five roles for specific actors:  [[Yvonne de Bray]], [[Madeleine Ozeray]], [[Gabrielle Dorziat]], [[Louis Jouvet]], and [[Jean Marais]] (and the first two of these lent their first names to the characters).\n\nThe play mingles elements of tragedy and farce. Cocteau said that he wanted to write in the manner of popular theatre (\"une pi\u00e8ce de boulevard\") - but also to make it a portrait of such theatre. He was seeking to engage with his audience while raising to the level of tragedy a theme that was almost out of \"vaudeville\".<ref>Jean Cocteau, in ''[[Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires]]'', 31 jan. 1946; reprinted in ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) p.223: \"''Les Parents terribles'' affectent d'\u00eatre ce qu'on a coutume d'appeler une 'pi\u00e8ce de boulevard'. \u00c0  vrai dire, elle en est une peinture, un portrait. Je cherchais un subterfuge pour vivre de plain-pied avec la salle, tout en haussant un th\u00e8me presque de vaudeville jusqu'\u00e0 la trag\u00e9die.\"</ref>\n\nInitially it was proposed that Jouvet should produce the play at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]], but he then rejected the piece and withdrew from the project.  It then took several months of searching for a theatre before Cocteau made an agreement with Roger Capgras and [[Alice Coc\u00e9a]] to present the play at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Ambassadeurs in Paris. Rehearsals were troubled and several changes of cast took place. Alice Coc\u00e9a took over the role of Madeleine and Marcel Andr\u00e9 took the part of Georges.  Most significantly, Yvonne de Bray became ill and had to be replaced by [[Germaine Dermoz]]. (The published version of the play was still dedicated to Yvonne de Bray.)<ref name=\"touzot\">Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.181-191.</ref>\n\nThe first performance took place on 14 November 1938. The initial reaction of the Parisian critics was predominantly enthusiastic. \"A kind of triumph for the theatre, the author, and the actors\" was one judgment.<ref>In ''Journal des d\u00e9bats'', quoted by Jean Touzot in: Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.184.</ref> Only the right-wing press took a different view, deploring the play's apparently loose morality. [[Robert Brasillach]] wrote a particularly vehement attack on the play, referring to its putrefaction (\"pourriture\"), defilement (\"profanation\"), and filth (\"ordure\"): \"the smell of dirty linen fills the whole play\".<ref>Robert Brasillach, in ''La Revue universelle'', 1 d\u00e9c. 1938, quoted in Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.210-212: \"Mais l'odeur de linge sale emplit toute la pi\u00e8ce\".</ref>  Although numerous aspects of the play were cited to support these denunciations, it was the allegation that it portrayed an incestuous relationship between mother and son which caused the greatest controversy.\n\nNone of this deterred the public from attending in large numbers, but the play's initial run was brought to an abrupt halt when a proposal to hold a free performance for older children from local schools met with outraged objections. The theatre was controlled by the city authorities, and a decision to terminate the production was carried through amid fierce arguments.  Within a few weeks however, the play was installed at another theatre, the Bouffes-Parisiens, where it ran for 300 performances.<ref>Francis Steegmuller, ''Cocteau: a biography''. (London: Constable, 1986.) pp.440-441.</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a rambling apartment, a middle-aged couple, Yvonne and Georges, live with their 22-year-old son Michel and Yvonne's spinster sister L\u00e9onie (\"tante L\u00e9o\"), who has also been in love with Georges.  Yvonne is a reclusive semi-invalid, dependent on her insulin treatment, and intensely possessive of her son (who returns her immoderate affection and calls her \"Sophie\"); Georges distractedly pursues his eccentric inventions; it is left to L\u00e9o to preserve such order as she can in their life and their apartment, which she describes as a \"gypsy caravan\" (\"la roulotte\"). When Michel announces that he is in love with a girl, Madeleine, whom he wishes to introduce to them, his parents are immediately hostile and seek to forbid the relationship, reducing Michel to despair. Georges realises that Madeleine is the same woman who has been his own mistress in recent months, and he confesses all to L\u00e9o, who devises a plan to extricate father and son by forcing Madeleine into silent surrender of them both.\n\nThe family visit Madeleine in her apartment where they are impressed by her modest and well-disciplined manner. Michel's initial joy at this apparent reconciliation turns to despair as Madeleine is blackmailed into rejecting him by Georges's secret threats. Yvonne consoles her son with satisfaction as they return home. L\u00e9o however is appalled by the cruelty and selfishness of what has been done and decides to support Madeleine.\n\nThe next day L\u00e9o persuades Georges, and then the more reluctant Yvonne, that the only way to rescue the inconsolable Michel is to allow him to marry Madeleine. Michel and Madeleine are joyfully reunited, but Yvonne is unnoticed as she slips away and takes an overdose of insulin. When the others realise what she has done, it is too late to save her. A new order is established in the \"roulotte\".\n\n== Productions ==\n\nThe original production, by Roger Capgras and Alice Coc\u00e9a, was mounted at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Ambassadeurs in Paris between 14 November and 20 December 1938.  After this run was terminated amid accusations of immorality, the production was transferred to the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens]] in January 1939 where it continued until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn October 1941, during the German occupation of Paris, the play was revived at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase Marie Bell|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase]] with its dedicatee Yvonne de Bray appearing in it for the first time. [[Serge Reggiani]] replaced Jean Marais in the role of Michel. Influential enemies of Cocteau mounted a campaign of opposition and at the first performances rats were released in the auditorium and tear-gas bombs were thrown on the stage. The play was banned by the city authorities. The ban was briefly lifted in December and the play resumed amid further disturbances before being swiftly cancelled again.<ref>Jean Touzot in: Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.189-190.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ''Les Parents terribles'' was revived again at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase in February 1946, and this time found almost the ideal cast that Cocteau had envisaged. Yvonne de Bray, Gabrielle Dorziat, Marcel Andr\u00e9 and Jean Marais returned to their roles, and [[Josette Day]] took the part of Madeleine. It ran for over 500 performances, with later cast changes, and in 1949 the production formed part of a theatrical tour which Cocteau organised in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1977, Jean Marais directed a new Paris production at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine]], in which he himself now played the role of Georges.  The rest of the cast were [[Lila Kedrova]] (Yvonne), France Delahalle (L\u00e9o), Caroline Silhol (Madeleine), and Fran\u00e7ois Duval (Michel). It had 260 performances in Paris, and subsequently was taken on international tour and was recorded for French television.<ref>Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot.

Despite initial problems with censorship, it was revived on the French stage several times after its original production, and in 1948 a [[Les Parents terribles (film)|film adaptation]] directed by Cocteau was released.  English-language versions have been produced under various titles including ''Intimate Relations'' and ''Indiscretions''.\n\n==History==\nIn January 1938 Cocteau wanted to concentrate on writing a new play and left Paris to stay in Montargis, accompanied by [[Jean Marais]]. A concentrated period of work led to the completion of the text by the end of February. Its title was then ''La Roulotte ou la maison dans la lune'' (\"The caravan or the house on the moon\"), referring to the negligent way of life of certain characters, and the unrealistic attitude of others. Cocteau intended the five roles for specific actors:  [[Yvonne de Bray]], [[Madeleine Ozeray]], Gabrielle Dorziat, [[Louis Jouvet]], and Jean Marais (and the first two of these lent their first names to the characters).\n\nThe play mingles elements of tragedy and farce. Cocteau said that he wanted to write in the manner of popular theatre (\"une pi\u00e8ce de boulevard\") - but also to make it a portrait of such theatre. He was seeking to engage with his audience while raising to the level of tragedy a theme that was almost out of \"vaudeville\".<ref>Jean Cocteau, in ''[[Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires]]'', 31 jan. 1946; reprinted in ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) p.223: \"''Les Parents terribles'' affectent d'\u00eatre ce qu'on a coutume d'appeler une 'pi\u00e8ce de boulevard'. \u00c0  vrai dire, elle en est une peinture, un portrait. Je cherchais un subterfuge pour vivre de plain-pied avec la salle, tout en haussant un th\u00e8me presque de vaudeville jusqu'\u00e0 la trag\u00e9die.\"</ref>\n\nInitially it was proposed that Jouvet should produce the play at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]], but he then rejected the piece and withdrew from the project.  It then took several months of searching for a theatre before Cocteau made an agreement with Roger Capgras and [[Alice Coc\u00e9a]] to present the play at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Ambassadeurs in Paris. Rehearsals were troubled and several changes of cast took place. Alice Coc\u00e9a took over the role of Madeleine and Marcel Andr\u00e9 took the part of Georges.  Most significantly, Yvonne de Bray became ill and had to be replaced by [[Germaine Dermoz]]. (The published version of the play was still dedicated to Yvonne de Bray.)<ref name=\"touzot\">Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.181-191.</ref>\n\nThe first performance took place on 14 November 1938. The initial reaction of the Parisian critics was predominantly enthusiastic. \"A kind of triumph for the theatre, the author, and the actors\" was one judgment.<ref>In ''Journal des d\u00e9bats'', quoted by Jean Touzot in: Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.184.</ref> Only the right-wing press took a different view, deploring the play's apparently loose morality. [[Robert Brasillach]] wrote a particularly vehement attack on the play, referring to its putrefaction (\"pourriture\"), defilement (\"profanation\"), and filth (\"ordure\"): \"the smell of dirty linen fills the whole play\".<ref>Robert Brasillach, in ''La Revue universelle'', 1 d\u00e9c. 1938, quoted in Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.210-212: \"Mais l'odeur de linge sale emplit toute la pi\u00e8ce\".</ref>  Although numerous aspects of the play were cited to support these denunciations, it was the allegation that it portrayed an incestuous relationship between mother and son which caused the greatest controversy.\n\nNone of this deterred the public from attending in large numbers, but the play's initial run was brought to an abrupt halt when a proposal to hold a free performance for older children from local schools met with outraged objections. The theatre was controlled by the city authorities, and a decision to terminate the production was carried through amid fierce arguments.  Within a few weeks however, the play was installed at another theatre, the Bouffes-Parisiens, where it ran for 300 performances.<ref>Francis Steegmuller, ''Cocteau: a biography''. (London: Constable, 1986.) pp.440-441.</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a rambling apartment, a middle-aged couple, Yvonne and Georges, live with their 22-year-old son Michel and Yvonne's spinster sister L\u00e9onie (\"tante L\u00e9o\"), who has also been in love with Georges.  Yvonne is a reclusive semi-invalid, dependent on her insulin treatment, and intensely possessive of her son (who returns her immoderate affection and calls her \"Sophie\"); Georges distractedly pursues his eccentric inventions; it is left to L\u00e9o to preserve such order as she can in their life and their apartment, which she describes as a \"gypsy caravan\" (\"la roulotte\"). When Michel announces that he is in love with a girl, Madeleine, whom he wishes to introduce to them, his parents are immediately hostile and seek to forbid the relationship, reducing Michel to despair. Georges realises that Madeleine is the same woman who has been his own mistress in recent months, and he confesses all to L\u00e9o, who devises a plan to extricate father and son by forcing Madeleine into silent surrender of them both.\n\nThe family visit Madeleine in her apartment where they are impressed by her modest and well-disciplined manner. Michel's initial joy at this apparent reconciliation turns to despair as Madeleine is blackmailed into rejecting him by Georges's secret threats. Yvonne consoles her son with satisfaction as they return home. L\u00e9o however is appalled by the cruelty and selfishness of what has been done and decides to support Madeleine.\n\nThe next day L\u00e9o persuades Georges, and then the more reluctant Yvonne, that the only way to rescue the inconsolable Michel is to allow him to marry Madeleine. Michel and Madeleine are joyfully reunited, but Yvonne is unnoticed as she slips away and takes an overdose of insulin. When the others realise what she has done, it is too late to save her. A new order is established in the \"roulotte\".\n\n== Productions ==\n\nThe original production, by Roger Capgras and Alice Coc\u00e9a, was mounted at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Ambassadeurs in Paris between 14 November and 20 December 1938.  After this run was terminated amid accusations of immorality, the production was transferred to the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens]] in January 1939 where it continued until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn October 1941, during the German occupation of Paris, the play was revived at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase Marie Bell|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase]] with its dedicatee Yvonne de Bray appearing in it for the first time. [[Serge Reggiani]] replaced Jean Marais in the role of Michel. Influential enemies of Cocteau mounted a campaign of opposition and at the first performances rats were released in the auditorium and tear-gas bombs were thrown on the stage. The play was banned by the city authorities. The ban was briefly lifted in December and the play resumed amid further disturbances before being swiftly cancelled again.<ref>Jean Touzot in: Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''. (Paris: Gallimard, 1994) pp.189-190.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ''Les Parents terribles'' was revived again at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase in February 1946, and this time found almost the ideal cast that Cocteau had envisaged. Yvonne de Bray, Gabrielle Dorziat, Marcel Andr\u00e9 and Jean Marais returned to their roles, and [[Josette Day]] took the part of Madeleine. It ran for over 500 performances, with later cast changes, and in 1949 the production formed part of a theatrical tour which Cocteau organised in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1977, Jean Marais directed a new Paris production at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine]], in which he himself now played the role of Georges.  The rest of the cast were [[Lila Kedrova]] (Yvonne), France Delahalle (L\u00e9o), Caroline Silhol (Madeleine), and Fran\u00e7ois Duval (Michel). It had 260 performances in Paris, and subsequently was taken on international tour and was recorded for French television.<ref>Jean Cocteau, ''Les Parents terribles''; \u00e9dition de Jean Touzot.

The game was released in 2018 in Japan, and released internationally in 2019.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player controls a girl named Rei Hatada, who in order to revive her dead younger sister Mirai Hatada, makes a deal with twin demons of Purgatory, and the story progresses as the player fights the souls that drift about Purgatory. The concept of the game revolves around crying, which purifies new equipment to use. By defeating specific enemies, \"Memoirs of the Dead,\" final thoughts of the dead, will appear, and crying will purify those thoughts and develop the protagonist mentally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/06/crystar-first-details-gameplay-screenshots|title=Crystar first details, gameplay, and screenshots|date=2018-06-21|website=Gematsu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> \n\nOutside of battle and dungeon exploration, the player can also return to Rei's room in the real-world part of the game and prepare for battle, view collectibles, pet her dog, and to enjoy everyday life through various angles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/06/20/crystar-protagonist-useless-girl-must-revive-beloved-sister-killed/|title=Crystar Is About A Useless Girl Who Must Revive Her Beloved Sister\u2026 That She Killed|date=2018-06-20|website=Siliconera|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nRei and Mirai Hatada are summoned to Purgatory by an evil revenant, Anamnesis who wants to kill them and take their souls so that she can achieve revival, having died in the past. Rei awakens to the power of an executor and fights Anamnesis, however she accidentally kills her sister during the fight and so agrees to work with Mephis and Pheles, the managers of Purgatory, to collect Idea, and the demons agree they will revive Mirai if Rei collects enough and gives the Idea to them, though Rei only has a certain amount of time before Mirai's soul is taken by the cogs of renewal and turned into a new soul, which would be a new person altogether. As she transverses Purgatory Rei fights against a strong Revenent known as Epicurean and after defeating it, hesitates to kill it when she learns the soul belonged to a young girl. As it was about to kill her she is saved by another executor, Kokoro Fudoji, who had been working for the demons for months, and Epicurean escapes. Kokoro's desire is to get revenge on Anamnesis as she also summoned Kokoro to Purgatory and took the souls of her boyfriend and unborn child. Kokoro later learns that her boyfriend has become a revenant working for Anamnesis and so Kokoro and Rei kill him and absorb his soul, Korkoro unfazed as she was now in love with Rei instead. As they go further in, they learn that a girl named Sen Megumiba was the only survivor of a bus crash, which also took the life of Rei's only real life friend, Yuri Minano. They come across Sen in Purgatory who had been dragged in by a serial killer-turned revenant who had been prosecuted by her father, and after he defeats Kokoro and Rei he is about to absorb Sen's soul as revenge, however the demons give Sen Executor powers and she slits his throat which stops him from being able to devour souls, after which the group kill him. They are then sidetracked by a revenant named Nanana who for reasons unknown is in love with Rei. She forces them to play games such as hide and seek and eventually fights against the group, first as herself, and then as her transformed self Epicurus. After being defeated the group agree to let Nanana join them as otherwise she would continue being a nuisance. As they reach the middle layer of Purgatory Rei senses her sister's soul and starts to forsake her friends, acting cold to them as all she cares about is getting her sister and even becomes cold to her pet dog, Thelema - who dies after she got angry at her. As they get closer and closer to Mirei's soul, Rei ditches the group and goes on her own, not caring about the rest of the group, and after defeating the two dog revenants who guard the towers to the second half of Purgatory, Thelema appears in front of Rei, now a revenant, and fuses with the guardians to form Therion and fights Rei. As Rei hesitates again, not wanting to fight her pet, her friends arrive and Rei apologies for her actions and the group kill Therion. Now in the second half of Purgatory they defeat Anamnesis and her minions, the Bourbaki, though Anamnesis is able to escape. The group learn of the Revenent Princess from the Bourbaki, who the group assume is Anamnesis. They then reach the next area of Puragatory where Sen remembers she was pulled into this area year earlier, in which they find Rei's former friend Yuri Minano, who is now a revenant. Yuri merges with the remains of the bus and tries to kill Rei as Yuri had learned in the year since that the Revenent Princess pulled the bus into purgatory as she was Rei's friend, so her death was Rei's fault. After killing Yuri they reach the final layer of purgatory, where Mirai's soul is, however unknown to the rest of the group the twin demons had told Sen that Anamnesis is actually her mother who died in the bus crash, and also tell Nanana that being in the final layer of purgatory will cause her to lose her memories as the final area is not safe for revenants due to the fact they will be reborn as new souls there. As they reach the end of purgatory they find Anamnesis and defeat her. Anamnesis's plan was to murder Rei in front of Mirai as revenge, though Rei has no idea why Anamnesis hates her and Mirai, after which Anamesis would achieve revival to be with her daughter again (unaware her daughter was Sen as she lost her memories upon becoming Anamesis). After defeating Anamnesis Sen protects her before Kokoro is able to get her revenge and kill her. Sen reveals to the group that Anamnesis is her mother, and Kokoro and Sen fight to the death over Anamnesis' life. As they fight, Anamnesis pushes Mirai into the cogs of renewal which would be enough for her to get revenge on Rei and Mirei even if she can't kill them, as Mirai would be reborn as a different person with no memories - this fails however as Nanana manages to stop Mirai from falling in and winds up inside it instead, causing Nanana's soul to be reborn instead. Rei's despair at losing Nanana causes her to get the final Idea needed for Mirai's revival, and Mirei is then revived by the demons with the fates of Kokoro, Sen, and Anamnesis being left unknown. As Rei and Mirai return to the real world, Mirei loses her memories of the others as Mirai happily states they will be together forever, with it being revealed that Mirai is actually the Revenant Princess wanted Rei all to herself. Rei's heartbreak at losing Nanana also caused Alcea to be created, which is even stronger than Idea, and Kuon Hatada uses to create a new timeline. \n\nIn the second timeline, the events are the same up to Bourbaki. In the previous timeline Rei and Nanana were split up from Sen and Kokoro before Rei and Nanana fight the Bourbaki and Amanesis, however in the second timeline Rei and Sen are instead spilt up from Kokoro and Nanana. As they fight Amanesis and the Bourbaki, Anamnesis reveals that she is Sen's mother, having regained her memories of her real life after seeing Sen. As Nanana was with Rei at this point in the previous timeline, Amanesis gains her memories much earlier than last time, and Sen learns about her mother much earlier as well (meaning the demons didn't need to tell her in secret). As Kokoro and Nanana regroup with Rei and Sen they try to kill Anamnesis, however Sen protects Anamnesis who manages to escape. As they travel through the area where Sen was originally pulled into Purgatory a year earlier, Sen says she will eventually tell Kokoro why she protected Anamnesis and after killing Yuri, Sen tells Kokoro that Anamnesis is her mother. Once they reach the final level of purgatory and defeat Anamnesis, Kokoro decides to give up on her revenge and states she will allow Anamnesis and Sen to be a family again in Purgatory as long as Anamnesis agrees to a contract with the demons just like Nanana, provided Anamnesis agrees to never kill another human again, or try to achieve revival, however just as she agrees to Kokoro's demands Mirai arrives and reveals herself as the Revenant Princess having regained her powers in this timeline, and kills Anamnesis. As Mirai boasts and taunts about how she will have Rei to herself, Nanana snaps having lost all her memories and attacks the group, though Kokoro and Sen fight Nanana in her Epicurus form, allowing Rei to chase after Mirai. After defeating Mirai, Mirai readies one final attack, which impales both sisters and they die in each other's arms, the fate of Sen, Kokoro, and Nanana being left unknown once again. The shock of her sister's betrayal creates a second Alcea, and Kuon once again uses it to create a new timeline. \n\nIn the third timeline the events are the same once again, only this time Rei and Kokoro are split up from Sen and Nanana. Unlike the previous two times (as she would escape in the previous two timelines) Anamnesis is defeated and killed by Rei and Kokoro, and with no heartbreak caused this time, which is needed to create Idea, the demons pose as Anamnesis and appear to Sen, telling her that she used the last of her power before dying to tell her that Kokoro knew she was her Sen's and laughed and killed Anamnesis not caring that she was Sen's mother, whilst also stating that Kokoro made up the stuff about Anamnesis killing her boyfriend and baby. As the group meet back up, Sen and Kokoro become at odds because of this (though Sen doesn't reveal why she's pissed off at Kokoro). In the area where Sen was originally summoned, the demons split up the girls and pose as them, mocking and insulting each girl to cause distrust and hate between them. As they reach the final area of purgatory the girls continuously butt heads and as they reach the cogs of renewal (Mirai's revival being the only reason Sen was still with the group as she wouldn't go back on her promise to help Rei grant Mirai's revival) Mirai reveals she is the Revenent Princess and that she was the one who summoned the bus with Sen, Yuri, and Sen's mother on it as she was pissed off that Rei had a friend in real life. Mirei had died a year earlier and collected enough souls for revival and decided to take Yuri's soul so that Rei would be only hers, with Sen and Anamnesis being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Revival causes people's memories to be altered as though the person never died, and thus Rei was unaware that her sister had died, gone to purgatory, and then achieved revival. After Mirai had pulled the bus into Purgatory, Mirai forced everyone on the bus to kill each other until only one remained, with Sen as the only survivor (as she hid, with her mother being the final survivor who then killed herself so Sen could escape) which is why Anamnesis hated Rei, as she was the reason that she died in the bus crash. Still manipulating the girls to get more Idea, the demons give Mirai two prisons which are impossible to escape from and Mirai, hating the fact that Rei had made three new friends, traps Rei and Nanana in one, and Sen and Kokoro in the other, and then tells them to fight to the death and that only one of them could survive to fight Mirai. Still thinking that Kokoro killed her mother for no reason and \"knew\" about their relation, Sen murders Kokoro and escapes her prison, whilst Nanana eventually snaps after losing the last of her memories and Rei kills her in self defence, which allows her to leave her prison. Rei meets up with Mirai who laughs and taunts about how she will have Rei all to herself as all her friends are dead, however she does this for too long and Sen stabs Mirai from behind, killing her, getting revenge on Mirai for what she did a year earlier. The demons still keep the rule that only one of them can escape however, and Sen attacks Rei since Rei was technically responsible for her mother's death due Mirai pulling them into Purgatory, however Rei wins the fight and kills Sen in self defence. As Rei wallows in despair she creates a large amount of Idea, and deciding to upset Rei even more the demon twins reveal that they had been manipulating the girls all along, and that they were responsible for all the revenents they had fought, and had even murdered Rei's dog (rather than Thelema dying of natural causes) just to create Idea through despair. Realising that everything bad that had happened was their fault, Rei decides she will kill the twins in revenge however she is easily defeated and the twins kill Rei, bored of their playtoy. Rai learning about the demons true intentions created a third alcea, and Kuon uses it to create a fourth timeline. \n\nIn the fourth timeline, Kuon finally has enough alcea to be able to change fate and so uses it on Rei after she is pulled into purgatory which gives Rei all her memories from the previous three timelines. Kuon reveals that she was Rei's twin sister that died in the womb, and that her soul was absorbed by Rei after her death, and when she was dragged into purgatory their souls split back into two, which allowed Kuon to work in the background to be able to get Rei enough power to defeat the demons. Kuon then fights Rei, and Rei is forced to kill the sister she just met, absorbing her soul, giving her her full soul back and making her more powerful as she was now whole again. The alcea also causes everyone Rei met to gain the memories of the previous timelines as well, though this includes the demons twins. As they attack Rei, trying to kill her again like in the third timeline, Epicurean suddenly appears and defends Rei, and Epicurean reveals that she was actually Nanana, and that she loved Rei because she had spared her life when she first hesitated to kill her first revenent. They escape together and try to defeat the twins without Kokoro and Sen though wind up finding them in Purgatory anyway. Sen refuses to join the group having learned that she was tricked in the previous timeline into hating her friends and becoming a revenge driven murderer, though joins after Kokoro says she forgives her as \"this version\" of Sen hadn't killed anyone yet. The demon twins invite the group to their domain and when they reach them, the girls are able to defeat Mephis and Pheles, however even though Rei, Sen, and Nanana hadn't agreed to the Executor contracts in this timeline yet (Kokoro having agreed months before) the contract transferred over to this timeline as well (which was the only reason they were even able to fight the twins in the first place) and thus the twins mind control the girls and try force them to fight each other to the death again - however Anamnesis and Mirai interfere (Mirai stating that she's the only one allowed to bully Rei) and transport the girls into their souls, and help them girls overcome their greatest insecurities, which is where the twins had placed the contracts within their souls. Rei gets over the despair that she was the one who killed her sister, Kokoro deals with the despair of Anamnesis taking the souls of her boyfriend and baby, Sen deals with the grief of Mirai killing her mother, and Nanana accepts the fact that she is actually Nanami Ataraxia and not Nanana, and this breaks the contract for the girls. Shocked that the contracts no longer have any effect, Mephis and Pheles merge together to form Mephistopheles but are killed by the group. Nanana takes over as the manager of purgatory and a few months later (when time would run out to revive Mirai) the girls return to purgatory where they meet Mirai and Anamnesis. To atone for their sins, having murdered countless people in all four timelines, Mirai and Anamnesis decide to go into the cogs of renewal, causing their souls to be reborn as new souls, erasing themselves, and Rei and Mirai and Anamnesis and Sen say goodbye to their family members forever.\n\n== Development ==\nThe title of the game, ''Crystar'', is a [[portmanteau]] of \"cry\" and \"star.\" The idea came the producer Fuyuki Hayashi, who wants to replicate the feelings where one can draw shining things (akin to a 'star') in a sad event that also makes one 'cry'.<ref>{{Cite

developed by Gemdrops. The game was released in 2018 in Japan, and released internationally in 2019.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player controls a girl named Rei Hatada, who in order to revive her dead younger sister Mirai Hatada, makes a deal with twin demons of Purgatory, and the story progresses as the player fights the souls that drift about Purgatory. The concept of the game revolves around crying, which purifies new equipment to use. By defeating specific enemies, \"Memoirs of the Dead,\" final thoughts of the dead, will appear, and crying will purify those thoughts and develop the protagonist mentally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/06/crystar-first-details-gameplay-screenshots|title=Crystar first details, gameplay, and screenshots|date=2018-06-21|website=Gematsu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> \n\nOutside of battle and dungeon exploration, the player can also return to Rei's room in the real-world part of the game and prepare for battle, view collectibles, pet her dog, and to enjoy everyday life through various angles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/06/20/crystar-protagonist-useless-girl-must-revive-beloved-sister-killed/|title=Crystar Is About A Useless Girl Who Must Revive Her Beloved Sister\u2026 That She Killed|date=2018-06-20|website=Siliconera|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nRei and Mirai Hatada are summoned to Purgatory by an evil revenant, Anamnesis who wants to kill them and take their souls so that she can achieve revival, having died in the past. Rei awakens to the power of an executor and fights Anamnesis, however she accidentally kills her sister during the fight and so agrees to work with Mephis and Pheles, the managers of Purgatory, to collect Idea, and the demons agree they will revive Mirai if Rei collects enough and gives the Idea to them, though Rei only has a certain amount of time before Mirai's soul is taken by the cogs of renewal and turned into a new soul, which would be a new person altogether. As she transverses Purgatory Rei fights against a strong Revenent known as Epicurean and after defeating it, hesitates to kill it when she learns the soul belonged to a young girl. As it was about to kill her she is saved by another executor, Kokoro Fudoji, who had been working for the demons for months, and Epicurean escapes. Kokoro's desire is to get revenge on Anamnesis as she also summoned Kokoro to Purgatory and took the souls of her boyfriend and unborn child. Kokoro later learns that her boyfriend has become a revenant working for Anamnesis and so Kokoro and Rei kill him and absorb his soul, Korkoro unfazed as she was now in love with Rei instead. As they go further in, they learn that a girl named Sen Megumiba was the only survivor of a bus crash, which also took the life of Rei's only real life friend, Yuri Minano. They come across Sen in Purgatory who had been dragged in by a serial killer-turned revenant who had been prosecuted by her father, and after he defeats Kokoro and Rei he is about to absorb Sen's soul as revenge, however the demons give Sen Executor powers and she slits his throat which stops him from being able to devour souls, after which the group kill him. They are then sidetracked by a revenant named Nanana who for reasons unknown is in love with Rei. She forces them to play games such as hide and seek and eventually fights against the group, first as herself, and then as her transformed self Epicurus. After being defeated the group agree to let Nanana join them as otherwise she would continue being a nuisance. As they reach the middle layer of Purgatory Rei senses her sister's soul and starts to forsake her friends, acting cold to them as all she cares about is getting her sister and even becomes cold to her pet dog, Thelema - who dies after she got angry at her. As they get closer and closer to Mirei's soul, Rei ditches the group and goes on her own, not caring about the rest of the group, and after defeating the two dog revenants who guard the towers to the second half of Purgatory, Thelema appears in front of Rei, now a revenant, and fuses with the guardians to form Therion and fights Rei. As Rei hesitates again, not wanting to fight her pet, her friends arrive and Rei apologies for her actions and the group kill Therion. Now in the second half of Purgatory they defeat Anamnesis and her minions, the Bourbaki, though Anamnesis is able to escape. The group learn of the Revenent Princess from the Bourbaki, who the group assume is Anamnesis. They then reach the area of Puragatory where Sen was pulled into a year earlier, in which they find Rei's former friend Yuri Minano, who is now a revenant. Yuri merges with the remains of the bus and tries to kill Rei as Yuri had learned in the year since that the Revenent Princess pulled the bus into purgatory as she was Rei's friend, so her death was Rei's fault. After killing Yuri they reach the final layer of purgatory, where Mirai's soul is, however unknown to the rest of the group the twin demons had told Sen that Anamnesis is actually her mother who died in the bus crash, and also tell Nanana that being in the final layer of purgatory will cause her to lose her memories as the final area is not safe for revenants due to the fact they will be reborn as new souls there. As they reach the end of purgatory they find Anamnesis and defeat her. Anamnesis's plan was to murder Rei in front of Mirai as revenge, though Rei has no idea why Anamnesis hates her and Mirai, after which Anamesis would achieve revival to be with her daughter again (unaware her daughter was Sen as she lost her memories upon becoming Anamesis). After defeating Anamnesis Sen protects her before Kokoro is able to get her revenge and kill her. Sen reveals to the group that Anamnesis is her mother, and Kokoro and Sen fight to the death over Anamnesis' life. As they fight, Anamnesis pushes Mirai into the cogs of renewal which would be enough for her to get revenge on Rei and Mirei even if she can't kill them, as Mirai would be reborn as a different person with no memories - this fails however as Nanana manages to stop Mirai from falling in and winds up inside it instead, causing Nanana's soul to be reborn instead. Rei's despair at losing Nanana causes her to get the final Idea needed for Mirai's revival, and Mirei is then revived by the demons with the fates of Kokoro, Sen, and Anamnesis being left unknown. As Rei and Mirai return to the real world, Mirei loses her memories of the others as Mirai happily states they will be together forever, with it being revealed that Mirai is actually the Revenant Princess wanted Rei all to herself. Rei's heartbreak at losing Nanana also caused Alcea to be created, which is even stronger than Idea, and Kuon Hatada uses to create a new timeline. \n\nIn the second timeline, the events are the same up to Bourbaki. In the previous timeline Rei and Nanana were split up from Sen and Kokoro before Rei and Nanana fight the Bourbaki and Amanesis, however in the second timeline Rei and Sen are instead spilt up from Kokoro and Nanana. As they fight Amanesis and the Bourbaki, Anamnesis reveals that she is Sen's mother, having regained her memories of her real life after seeing Sen. As Nanana was with Rei at this point in the previous timeline, Amanesis gains her memories much earlier than last time, and Sen learns about her mother much earlier as well (meaning the demons didn't need to tell her in secret). As Kokoro and Nanana regroup with Rei and Sen they try to kill Anamnesis, however Sen protects Anamnesis who manages to escape. As they travel through the area where Sen was originally pulled into Purgatory a year earlier, Sen says she will eventually tell Kokoro why she protected Anamnesis and after killing Yuri, Sen tells Kokoro that Anamnesis is her mother. Once they reach the final level of purgatory and defeat Anamnesis, Kokoro decides to give up on her revenge and states she will allow Anamnesis and Sen to be a family again in Purgatory as long as Anamnesis agrees to a contract with the demons just like Nanana, provided Anamnesis agrees to never kill another human again, or try to achieve revival, however just as she agrees to Kokoro's demands Mirai arrives and reveals herself as the Revenant Princess having regained her powers in this timeline, and kills Anamnesis. As Mirai boasts and taunts about how she will have Rei to herself, Nanana snaps having lost all her memories and attacks the group, though Kokoro and Sen fight Nanana in her Epicurus form, allowing Rei to chase after Mirai. After defeating Mirai, Mirai readies one final attack, which impales both sisters and they die in each other's arms, the fate of Sen, Kokoro, and Nanana being left unknown once again. The shock of her sister's betrayal creates a second Alcea, and Kuon once again uses it to create a new timeline. \n\nIn the third timeline the events are the same once again, only this time Rei and Kokoro are split up from Sen and Nanana. Unlike the previous two times (as she would escape in the previous two timelines) Anamnesis is defeated and killed by Rei and Kokoro, and with no heartbreak caused this time, which is needed to create Idea, the demons pose as Anamnesis and appear to Sen, telling her that she used the last of her power before dying to tell her that Kokoro knew she was her Sen's and laughed and killed Anamnesis not caring that she was Sen's mother, whilst also stating that Kokoro made up the stuff about Anamnesis killing her boyfriend and baby. As the group meet back up, Sen and Kokoro become at odds because of this (though Sen doesn't reveal why she's pissed off at Kokoro). In the area where Sen was originally summoned, the demons split up the girls and pose as them, mocking and insulting each girl to cause distrust and hate between them. As they reach the final area of purgatory the girls continuously butt heads and as they reach the cogs of renewal (Mirai's revival being the only reason Sen was still with the group as she wouldn't go back on her promise to help Rei grant Mirai's revival) Mirai reveals she is the Revenent Princess and that she was the one who summoned the bus with Sen, Yuri, and Sen's mother on it as she was pissed off that Rei had a friend in real life. Mirei had died a year earlier and collected enough souls for revival and decided to take Yuri's soul so that Rei would be only hers, with Sen and Anamnesis being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Revival causes people's memories to be altered as though the person never died, and thus Rei was unaware that her sister had died, gone to purgatory, and then achieved revival. After Mirai had pulled the bus into Purgatory, Mirai forced everyone on the bus to kill each other until only one remained, with Sen as the only survivor (as she hid, with her mother being the final survivor who then killed herself so Sen could escape) which is why Anamnesis hated Rei, as she was the reason that she died in the bus crash. Still manipulating the girls to get more Idea, the demons give Mirai two prisons which are impossible to escape from and Mirai, hating the fact that Rei had made three new friends, traps Rei and Nanana in one, and Sen and Kokoro in the other, and then tells them to fight to the death and that only one of them could survive to fight Mirai. Still thinking that Kokoro killed her mother for no reason and \"knew\" about their relation, Sen murders Kokoro and escapes her prison, whilst Nanana eventually snaps after losing the last of her memories and Rei kills her in self defence, which allows her to leave her prison. Rei meets up with Mirai who laughs and taunts about how she will have Rei all to herself as all her friends are dead, however she does this for too long and Sen stabs Mirai from behind, killing her, getting revenge on Mirai for what she did a year earlier. The demons still keep the rule that only one of them can escape however, and Sen attacks Rei since Rei was technically responsible for her mother's death due Mirai pulling them into Purgatory, however Rei wins the fight and kills Sen in self defence. As Rei wallows in despair she creates a large amount of Idea, and deciding to upset Rei even more the demon twins reveal that they had been manipulating the girls all along, and that they were responsible for all the revenents they had fought, and had even murdered Rei's dog (rather than Thelema dying of natural causes) just to create Idea through despair. Realising that everything bad that had happened was their fault, Rei decides she will kill the twins in revenge however she is easily defeated and the twins kill Rei, bored of their playtoy. Rai learning about the demons true intentions created a third alcea, and Kuon uses it to create a fourth timeline. \n\nIn the fourth timeline, Kuon finally has enough alcea to be able to change fate and so uses it on Rei after she is pulled into purgatory which gives Rei all her memories from the previous three timelines. Kuon reveals that she was Rei's twin sister that died in the womb, and that her soul was absorbed by Rei after her death, and when she was dragged into purgatory their souls split back into two, which allowed Kuon to work in the background to be able to get Rei enough power to defeat the demons. Kuon then fights Rei, and Rei is forced to kill the sister she just met, absorbing her soul, giving her her full soul back and making her more powerful as she was now whole again. The alcea also causes everyone Rei met to gain the memories of the previous timelines as well, though this includes the demons twins. As they attack Rei, trying to kill her again like in the third timeline, Epicurean suddenly appears and defends Rei, and Epicurean reveals that she was actually Nanana, and that she loved Rei because she had spared her life when she first hesitated to kill her first revenent. They escape together and try to defeat the twins without Kokoro and Sen though wind up finding them in Purgatory anyway. Sen refuses to join the group having learned that she was tricked in the previous timeline into hating her friends and becoming a revenge driven murderer, though joins after Kokoro says she forgives her as \"this version\" of Sen hadn't killed anyone yet. The demon twins invite the group to their domain and when they reach them, the girls are able to defeat Mephis and Pheles, however even though Rei, Sen, and Nanana hadn't agreed to the Executor contracts in this timeline yet (Kokoro having agreed months before) the contract transferred over to this timeline as well (which was the only reason they were even able to fight the twins in the first place) and thus the twins mind control the girls and try force them to fight each other to the death again - however Anamnesis and Mirai interfere (Mirai stating that she's the only one allowed to bully Rei) and transport the girls into their souls, and help them girls overcome their greatest insecurities, which is where the twins had placed the contracts within their souls. Rei gets over the despair that she was the one who killed her sister, Kokoro deals with the despair of Anamnesis taking the souls of her boyfriend and baby, Sen deals with the grief of Mirai killing her mother, and Nanana accepts the fact that she is actually Nanami Ataraxia and not Nanana, and this breaks the contract for the girls. Shocked that the contracts no longer have any effect, Mephis and Pheles merge together to form Mephistopheles but are killed by the group. Nanana takes over as the manager of purgatory and a few months later (when time would run out to revive Mirai) the girls return to purgatory where they meet Mirai and Anamnesis. To atone for their sins, having murdered countless people in all four timelines, Mirai and Anamnesis decide to go into the cogs of renewal, causing their souls to be reborn as new souls, erasing themselves, and Rei and Mirai and Anamnesis and Sen say goodbye to their family members forever.\n\n== Development ==\nThe title of the game, ''Crystar'', is a [[portmanteau]] of \"cry\" and \"star.\"

{"title_page": "Healthcare in Kent", "text_new": "'''Healthcare in Kent''' is now mainly the responsibility from 1st April 2020 of the Kent & Medway [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]. Certain specialised services are directly commissioned by [[NHS England]], coordinated through the South East integrated regional team. Some NHS England structures are aligned on a Kent & Medway basis, others on a South East basis and there is liaison  with London that provides many tertiary (highly specialised) healthcare services to the residents of Kent.  \n\n==History==\nFrom 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Kent were managed by the South-East Metropolitan [[List of NHS Regional Hospital Boards (1947\u20131974)|Regional Hospital Board]].   In 1974 the Boards were abolished and replaced by [[Regional health authority (UK)|Regional Health Authorities]]. The whole of Kent came under the South East Metropolitan RHA.  Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Kent came under the South Thames Regional Health Authority.  Kent had an Area Health Authority from 1974 until 1982 when it was divided into five [[List of district health authorities in England and Wales|District Authorities]]: Canterbury and Thanet; Dartford and Gravesham; Maidstone; Medway; South East Kent;Tunbridge Wells. in 1993 these were amalgamated into two - West Kent and East Kent. Regional Health Authorities were reorganised and renamed [[Strategic Health Authorities]] in 2002. Kent was under Kent and Medway SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Kent came under NHS South East Coast until that was abolished in 2013. There were three [[Primary Care Trust]]s for the area: NHS Eastern and Coastal Kent; NHS West Kent; NHS Medway up until April 2013. After this eight [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s were established, being Canterbury and Coastal; Dartford Gravesham and Swanley; Medway; South Kent Coast;Swale; Thanet; West Kent; Ashford. These were given conditional approval to amalgamate in October 2019 and this progressed with formal approval on 20th March 2020 to the formation of the Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group on 1st April 2020.    \n\n==[[Sustainability and transformation plan]]s==\n\nKent (and Medway) formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Glenn Douglas, the Chief Executive of [[Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust]] as its leader.<ref>{{cite news|title=The leaders chosen for 41 of England's STPs|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/commissioning/revealed-the-leaders-chosen-for-41-of-englands-stps/7003640.article|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=30 March 2016}}</ref>  He was appointed accountable officer for all six CCGs in March 2018, having left the Trust.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former acute trust boss to lead six CCGs|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioning/former-acute-boss-to-lead-six-ccgs/7021901.article|accessdate=11 May 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 March 2018}}</ref> The subsequent establishment of a Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group in 2020 evolved from this structure. \n\nIn February 2018 it was reported that the Encompass project in Whitstable, Faversham & Canterbury had seen a 7.3% reduction in the emergency admissions rate in the area between 2014-15 and the 12 months to September 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Best and worst performing vanguards|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/revealed-best-and-worst-performing-vanguards/7021762.article|accessdate=5 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commissioning Issues==\nCommunity services are provided by [[Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust]] and [[Medway Community Healthcare]].

A classical dance titled [[Robam Kenorei]] depicts kinnaris playing in a lotus pond.\n\n==India==\nIn the Sanskrit language, the name Kinnara contains a question mark ([[Sanskrit]] : \u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0930?) i.e. is this man?. In Hindu mythology, Kinnara is described as half-man, half-horse, and half-bird. The Vishnudharmottara describes Kinnara as half-man and half-horse, but the correct nature of Kinnara as Buddhists understood is half-man and half-bird. The figure of Yaksha with a horse head illustrated in Bodh Gaya sculptures in however a Kinnari as the Jataka illustrating it treats her as a demi-god. According to the Jatakas, Kinnaras are fairies and are shown as going in pairs noted for mutual love and devotion. In the Chanda Kinnara Jataka the devotion of the Kinnarai to her wounded Kinnara husband brings Indra on the scene to cure him from the wound. The Kinnaras are noted for their long life.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |title=Mythical Animals in Indian Art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dMI4rZuRs1MC&pg=PA14&dq=Kinnaras#v=onepage&q=Kinnaras&f=false |year=1985 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn = 9780391032873}}</ref>\n\nThe Jatakas describe the Kinnaras as innocent and harmless, hop like birds, are fond of music and song, and with the female beating a drum and male playing on lute. Such harmless creatures are described in Jataka No.481 as being caught, put into cages, and thus presented to kings for their delight. In Jataka No.504, we have the autobiography of a Kinnara who describes the Kinnara class as human-like the wild things deem us; huntsmen call us goblins still. The Kinnaras can sing, play the flute and dance with soft movements of the body. Kalidasa in his Kumara Sambhava describes them as dwelling in the Himalayas. Kinnaras lived also over the hills of Pandaraka, Trikutaka, Mallangiri, Candapabbata, and Gandhamandana (Jataka No. 485). They were tender-hearted and Jataka No. 540 refers to the story of the Kinnaras nursing a human baby whose parents have gone away to the woods. Yet, we find that they were looked upon as queer animals and were hunted, captured and presented to the kings as entertainment. Flowers formed their dress. Their food was flower pollen and their cosmetics were made of flower perfumes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe depiction of Kinnara in early Indian art is an oft-repeated theme. The ancient sculptures of Sanchi, Barhut, Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, Mathura, and the paintings of Ajanta depict Kinnaras invariably. Frequently, they are seen in the sculptures flanking the stupas. In this case, they hold garlands or trays containing flowers in their hands for the worship of the Stupas. Sometimes, the Kinnaras appear in the sculptures holding garland in right hand and tray in the left hand. They also appear before Bodhi-Drumas, Dharmacakras, or playing a musical instrument. As such, the portrayal of Kinnaras in early Indian sculpture art is very common.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Indonesia==\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|Kinnara (male), Kinnari (female), [[Apsara]], and [[Devata]] guarding [[Kalpataru]], the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], Indonesia.]]\nThe images of coupled Kinnara and Kinnari can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples.

They are commonly seen carved into support figurines for the columns of [[Khmer architecture|post-Angkorian architecture]]. Kinnari are considered symbols of beauty and are skilled dancers.<ref>Headley, Robert K. (1997). Modern Cambodian-English Dictionary, Dunwoody Press</ref> The kinnari is a character archetype in the repertoire of the [[Royal Ballet of Cambodia]], appearing as mischievous groups that have a strong allurement. A classical dance titled ''robam kinar'' depicts kinnaris playing in a lotus pond.\n\n==India==\nIn the Sanskrit language, the name Kinnara contains a question mark ([[Sanskrit]] : \u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0930?) i.e. is this man?. In Hindu mythology, Kinnara is described as half-man, half-horse, and half-bird. The Vishnudharmottara describes Kinnara as half-man and half-horse, but the correct nature of Kinnara as Buddhists understood is half-man and half-bird. The figure of Yaksha with a horse head illustrated in Bodh Gaya sculptures in however a Kinnari as the Jataka illustrating it treats her as a demi-god. According to the Jatakas, Kinnaras are fairies and are shown as going in pairs noted for mutual love and devotion. In the Chanda Kinnara Jataka the devotion of the Kinnarai to her wounded Kinnara husband brings Indra on the scene to cure him from the wound. The Kinnaras are noted for their long life.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |title=Mythical Animals in Indian Art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dMI4rZuRs1MC&pg=PA14&dq=Kinnaras#v=onepage&q=Kinnaras&f=false |year=1985 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn = 9780391032873}}</ref>\n\nThe Jatakas describe the Kinnaras as innocent and harmless, hop like birds, are fond of music and song, and with the female beating a drum and male playing on lute. Such harmless creatures are described in Jataka No.481 as being caught, put into cages, and thus presented to kings for their delight. In Jataka No.504, we have the autobiography of a Kinnara who describes the Kinnara class as human-like the wild things deem us; huntsmen call us goblins still. The Kinnaras can sing, play the flute and dance with soft movements of the body. Kalidasa in his Kumara Sambhava describes them as dwelling in the Himalayas. Kinnaras lived also over the hills of Pandaraka, Trikutaka, Mallangiri, Candapabbata, and Gandhamandana (Jataka No. 485). They were tender-hearted and Jataka No. 540 refers to the story of the Kinnaras nursing a human baby whose parents have gone away to the woods. Yet, we find that they were looked upon as queer animals and were hunted, captured and presented to the kings as entertainment. Flowers formed their dress. Their food was flower pollen and their cosmetics were made of flower perfumes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe depiction of Kinnara in early Indian art is an oft-repeated theme. The ancient sculptures of Sanchi, Barhut, Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, Mathura, and the paintings of Ajanta depict Kinnaras invariably. Frequently, they are seen in the sculptures flanking the stupas. In this case, they hold garlands or trays containing flowers in their hands for the worship of the Stupas. Sometimes, the Kinnaras appear in the sculptures holding garland in right hand and tray in the left hand. They also appear before Bodhi-Drumas, Dharmacakras, or playing a musical instrument. As such, the portrayal of Kinnaras in early Indian sculpture art is very common.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Indonesia==\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|Kinnara (male), Kinnari (female), [[Apsara]], and [[Devata]] guarding [[Kalpataru]], the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], Indonesia.]]\nThe images of coupled Kinnara and Kinnari can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples.

Many were on [[Greenfield land|greenfield sites]] of [[semi-detached]] homes or [[terraced house|terraced cottages]]. In the 1930s, schemes tended to be more cheaply built, but a survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate. There was also extensive private building of sub-urban \"[[bungalow]] belts\", particularly around [[Edinburgh]]. From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive [[welfare state]] and the influence of [[modernism]]. As the post-war desire for [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]] gained momentum it would focus on the [[tower block]]. \n\nAnother solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like [[Glenrothes]] and [[Cumbernauld]]. Initially praised, they were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century. The creation of [[Scottish Homes]] in 1989 increased the stock of private housing and reducing the role of the state sector and the direction of planning by local authorities. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers, many introducing English brick and [[half-timbered]] vernacular styles to Scotland. Sales of council houses were also popular. There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage and programmes of urban regeneration resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres. By 2011, there were 2.37 million households of which over sixty per cent were owner occupied. The number of single occupied household increased since 2001, largely accounting for an increase in the number of households. The devolved Scottish government took a distinct perspective on [[Homelessness in Scotland|homelessness]], making accommodation a right for the voluntarily homeless.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{See also|Architecture of Scotland in the Prehistoric era}}\n\n===Stone Age===\n[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|left|The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]], Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe]]\nThe oldest house for which there is evidence in Scotland is the oval structure of wooden posts found at [[South Queensferry]] near the [[Firth of Forth]], dating from the [[Mesolithic]] period, about 8240 BCE.<ref>R.

Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.<ref name=GRSEHouseholds/>\n\nThe average household size has decreased, with more people living alone or in smaller households. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of households containing just one adult increased by five per cent and the number of two adult households increased by eight per cent, while the number of households containing one adult fell by 11 per cent and the number of households containing two or more adults with children fell by three per cent. The number of households containing three or more adults increased by 11 per cent. These changes in household composition contributed to a four per cent increase in the number of households in Scotland between 2005 and 2010, which was higher than the increase in the population over this time (2.5 per cent).<ref name=GRSEHouseholds>General Register Office of Scotland, [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/households/estimates/2011/index.html Estimates of Households and Dwellings in Scotland, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116092017/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/households/estimates/2011/index.html |date=2013-11-16 }}, retrieved 23 February 2014.</ref>\n\nSince the establishment of a separate [[Scottish Parliament]] and devolved government in 1999, there has been a response to [[homelessness in Scotland]] that has been distinctive from the rest of the UK, described as a \"rights-based approach\". The 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act required local authorities to house homeless people while claims of priority need were investigated. Even if applicants were found not to be in priority need, councils were required to provide accommodation for a reasonable period. The 2003 Homelessness (Scotland) Act went further in phasing out the distinction between priority and non-priority need, so that by 2012 all people unintentionally homeless would be entitled to a permanent home. Partly as a result of these changing definitions, the number of applications for assistance assessed as in priority need increased from 20,000 in 2000/01 to 34,940 in 2008/09. The number of households in temporary accommodation also increased in from 4,600 in 2002 to 10,815 by 2010. Some local authorities expressed concerns that they would be unable to meet expanding demand from existing permanent accommodation.<ref>B. Lund, ''Understanding Housing Policy'' (The Policy Press, 2011), {{ISBN|184742631X}}, p. 174.</ref> From 2012\u201313 the number of people seeking help for homelessness fell by 11 per cent to 9,474. The number of people made homeless or threatened with homelessness fell by a tenth to 7,649. The number of people in temporary accommodation was about 6 per cent lower than the peak period in early 2011 when temporary placements were in excess of 12,000. The 2,821 households with children in temporary accommodation was a decrease of 472 households (14 per cent) from the previous year. These households contained a total of 4,574 children, a decrease of 727 children (14 per cent).<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25002321 \"Fall in Scottish homelessness applications\"], ''BBC Scotland News'', 19 November 2013, retrieved 23 February 2014.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Housing in Glasgow]]\n*[[Rent control in Scotland]]\n*[[Short assured tenancy (Scotland)]]\n*[[Scottish Housing News]]\n*[[Affordable housing by country]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*  Alexander, A., ''Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), {{ISBN|0-415-47513-9}}.\n*  Armit, I., ''Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7524-1932-3}}.\n*  Brunskill, R.

The oldest house in Scotland dates from the [[Mesolithic]] era. In the [[Neolithic]] era settled farming led to the construction of the first stone houses. There is also evidence from this period of large [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]]. In the [[Bronze Age]] there were cellular round[[crannogs]] (built on artificial islands) and [[hillforts]] that enclosed large settlements. In the [[Iron Age]] cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular [[broch]]s and [[dun]]s and [[wheelhouse (archaeology)|wheelhouses]].\n\nAfter the First World War, the government responded to urban deprivation with a massive programme of [[council house]] building. Many were on [[Greenfield land|greenfield sites]] of [[semi-detached]] homes or [[terraced house|terraced cottages]]. In the 1930s, schemes tended to be more cheaply built, but a survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate. There was also extensive private building of sub-urban \"[[bungalow]] belts\", particularly around [[Edinburgh]]. From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive [[welfare state]] and the influence of [[modernism]]. As the post-war desire for [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]] gained momentum it would focus on the [[tower block]]. \n\nAnother solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like [[Glenrothes]] and [[Cumbernauld]]. Initially praised, they were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century. The creation of [[Scottish Homes]] in 1989 increased the stock of private housing and reducing the role of the state sector and the direction of planning by local authorities. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers, many introducing English brick and [[half-timbered]] vernacular styles to Scotland. Sales of council houses were also popular. There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage and programmes of urban regeneration resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres. By 2011, there were 2.37 million households of which over sixty per cent were owner occupied. The number of single occupied household increased since 2001, largely accounting for an increase in the number of households. The devolved Scottish government took a distinct perspective on [[Homelessness in Scotland|homelessness]], making accommodation a right for the voluntarily homeless.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{See also|Architecture of Scotland in the Prehistoric era}}\n\n===Stone Age===\n[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|left|The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]], Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe]]\nThe oldest house for which there is evidence in Scotland is the oval structure of wooden posts found at [[South Queensferry]] near the [[Firth of Forth]], dating from the [[Mesolithic]] period, about 8240 BCE.<ref>R.

Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.<ref name=GRSEHouseholds/>\n\nThe average household size has decreased, with more people living alone or in smaller households. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of households containing just one adult increased by five per cent and the number of two adult households increased by eight per cent, while the number of households containing one adult fell by 11 per cent and the number of households containing two or more adults with children fell by three per cent. The number of households containing three or more adults increased by 11 per cent. These changes in household composition contributed to a four per cent increase in the number of households in Scotland between 2005 and 2010, which was higher than the increase in the population over this time (2.5 per cent).<ref name=GRSEHouseholds>General Register Office of Scotland, [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/households/estimates/2011/index.html Estimates of Households and Dwellings in Scotland, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116092017/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/households/estimates/2011/index.html |date=2013-11-16 }}, retrieved 23 February 2014.</ref>\n\nSince the establishment of a separate [[Scottish Parliament]] and devolved government in 1999, there has been a response to [[homelessness in Scotland]] that has been distinctive from the rest of the UK, described as a \"rights-based approach\". The 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act required local authorities to house homeless people while claims of priority need were investigated. Even if applicants were found not to be in priority need, councils were required to provide accommodation for a reasonable period. The 2003 Homelessness (Scotland) Act went further in phasing out the distinction between priority and non-priority need, so that by 2012 all people unintentionally homeless would be entitled to a permanent home. Partly as a result of these changing definitions, the number of applications for assistance assessed as in priority need increased from 20,000 in 2000/01 to 34,940 in 2008/09. The number of households in temporary accommodation also increased in from 4,600 in 2002 to 10,815 by 2010. Some local authorities expressed concerns that they would be unable to meet expanding demand from existing permanent accommodation.<ref>B. Lund, ''Understanding Housing Policy'' (The Policy Press, 2011), {{ISBN|184742631X}}, p. 174.</ref> From 2012\u201313 the number of people seeking help for homelessness fell by 11 per cent to 9,474. The number of people made homeless or threatened with homelessness fell by a tenth to 7,649. The number of people in temporary accommodation was about 6 per cent lower than the peak period in early 2011 when temporary placements were in excess of 12,000. The 2,821 households with children in temporary accommodation was a decrease of 472 households (14 per cent) from the previous year. These households contained a total of 4,574 children, a decrease of 727 children (14 per cent).<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25002321 \"Fall in Scottish homelessness applications\"], ''BBC Scotland News'', 19 November 2013, retrieved 23 February 2014.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Housing in Glasgow]]\n*[[Rent control in Scotland]]\n*[[Short assured tenancy (Scotland)]]\n*[[Scottish Housing News]]\n*[[Affordable housing by country]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*  Alexander, A., ''Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), {{ISBN|0-415-47513-9}}.\n*  Armit, I., ''Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7524-1932-3}}.\n*  Brunskill, R.

Aside from entomology related publications, he wrote two books ''The West'' (1927) and ''A Civilisation at Bay'' (1931, posthumously published). He was a friend and admirer of the humanist [[Brajendra Nath Seal]] and the British writer [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]] who sought a single united world government. As an agricultural entomologist, he identified several low-cost techniques to pest management and was a pioneer of [[Biological pest control|classical biological control]] approaches in India.\n\n==Life and career==\n\nKunhikannan was born in Kannur in the Kunnathedath family (which he used only by the initial \"K.\").

As a young man he held radical views about which he was outspoken while his father, well read in Sanskrit lore, advised that ''when you consider all aspects, you will feel convinced that your views are hasty.'' After his stay and travels to the United States and through Europe, he wrote about his views in a book called ''The West'' (1927), with admiration for some aspects and strong criticism of others. He saw first-hand, the lynching of blacks in the United States which disturbed him greatly and he wrote about the dangers of media control (by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in this case) and the fierce individualism that was encouraged by the West. An Indian reviewer considered it one of the fair reviews of the West at a time when eastern criticism had become fashionable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ruthnaswamy, M.|title=Review. The West. by K.

His book on India which was to be his comments on the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]] to discuss the future of India was published posthumously in a book titled ''A Civilisation at Bay'' (1931). The book supported various Indian traditions with a chapter on the merits of the joint family, four chapters covering caste that include theories for its origin and rationalizations for its existence.

As a young man he held radical views about which he was outspoken while his father, well read in Sanskrit lore, advised that ''when you consider all aspects, you will feel convinced that your views are hasty.''

He saw first-hand, the lynching of blacks in the United States which disturbed him greatly and he wrote about the dangers of media control (by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in this case) and the fierce individualism that was encouraged by the West.

{"title_page": "ISO week date", "text_new": "{{short description|Leap week calendar system}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Week date|Week|Week-day names|Week number}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020|talk=More citations needed}}\n\nThe '''ISO week date''' system is effectively a [[leap week calendar]] system that is part of the [[ISO 8601]] date and time standard issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) since 1988 (last revised in 2004) and, before that, it was defined in [[ISO 2015|ISO (R) 2015]] since 1971. It is used (mainly) in [[government]] and [[business]] for [[fiscal year]]s, as well as in timekeeping. This was previously known as \"Industrial date coding\". The system specifies a ''week year'' atop the [[Gregorian calendar]] by defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year.\n\nThe Gregorian [[leap cycle]], which has 97 leap days spread across 400 years, contains a whole number of weeks ({{val|20871}}). In every cycle there are 71 years with an additional 53rd week (corresponding to the Gregorian years that contain 53 Thursdays). An average year is exactly 52.1775 weeks long; months ({{frac|1|12}} year) average at exactly {{val|4.348125}} weeks.\n\nAn '''ISO week-numbering year''' (also called ''ISO year'' informally) has 52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 or 366 days. The extra week is sometimes referred to as a ''[[Leap week calendar|leap week]]'', although ISO 8601 does not use this term.\n\nWeeks start with Monday. Each week's year is the Gregorian year in which the Thursday falls. The first week of the year, hence, always [[ISO week date#First week|contains 4 January]]. ISO week [[year numbering]] therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days close to 1 January.\n\nA precise date is specified by the ISO week-numbering year in the format <var>YYYY</var>, a '''week number''' in the format <var>ww</var> prefixed by the letter 'W', and the '''weekday number''', a digit <var>d</var> from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday. For example, the Gregorian date Monday 23 December 2019 corresponds to Monday in the 52nd week of 2019, and is written 2019-W52-1 (in extended form) or 2019W521 (in compact form). The ISO year is slightly offset to the Gregorian year; for example, Monday 30 December 2019 in the Gregorian calendar is the first day of week 1 of 2020 in the ISO calendar, and is written as 2020-W01-1 or 2020W011.\n\n{{ISOCALENDAR|cdow=}}\n\n== Relation with the Gregorian calendar ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"{{float right}}; max-width: 50%;\"\n|+ Examples of contemporary dates around New Year\u2019s Day\n|-\n!

The days differing are a Friday through Sunday, or a Saturday and Sunday, or just a Sunday, at the start of the Gregorian year (which are at the end of the previous ISO year) and a Monday through Wednesday, or a Monday and Tuesday, or just a Monday, at the end of the Gregorian year (which are in week 01 of the next ISO year). In the period 4 January to 28 December the ISO week year number is always equal to the Gregorian year number. The same is true for every Thursday.\n\n=== First week ===\nThe ISO 8601 definition for week 01 is the week with the first Thursday of the Gregorian year (i.e. of January) in it.\nThe following definitions based on properties of this week are mutually equivalent, since the ISO week starts with Monday:\n* It is the first week with a majority (4 or more) of its days in January.\n* Its first day is the Monday nearest to 1 January.\n* It has 4 January in it. Hence the earliest possible first week extends from Monday 29 December (previous Gregorian year) to Sunday 4 January, the latest possible first week extends from Monday 4 January  to Sunday 10 January.\n* It has the year's first working day in it, if Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are not working days.\n\nIf '''1 January''' is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in W01. \nIf it is on a Friday, it is part of W53 of the previous year. \nIf it is on a Saturday, it is part of the last week of the previous year which is numbered W52 in a common year and W53 in a leap year. \nIf it is on a Sunday, it is part of W52 of the previous year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Dominical letter]](s) plus weekdays, dates and week numbers at the beginning and end of a year\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | Dominical<br>letter(s) \n! colspan=7 | Days at the beginning of January \n! colspan=4 | Effect \n! colspan=7 | Days at the end of December \n|-\n! style=\"width:4ex\" | 1<br>Mon || style=\"width:4ex\" | 2<br>Tue || style=\"width:4ex\" | 3<br>Wed || style=\"width:4ex\" | 4<br>Thu || style=\"width:4ex\" | 5<br>Fri || style=\"width:4ex\" | 6<br>Sat || style=\"width:4ex\" | 7<br>Sun \n! {{nobr|W01-1<sup>1</sup>}} !! 01 Jan week !! \u2026 !! 31 Dec week \n! title=\"First date of the last week in the year\" style=\"width:4ex\" | 1<br>Mon<sup>2</sup> || 2<br>Tue || 3<br> Wed || 4<br>Thu || 5<br>Fri || 6<br>Sat || 7<br>Sun\n|-\n!

A date is either expressed with a month and day-of-the-month, or with a week and day-of-the-week, never a mix.\n\nWeeks are a prominent entity in accounting where annual statistics benefit from regularity throughout the [[fiscal year|year]]s. Therefore, in practice usually a fixed length of 13 weeks per [[fiscal quarter|quarter]] is chosen which is then subdivided into [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar|5 + 4 + 4 weeks]], [[Sym454|4 + 5 + 4 weeks]] or [[4-4-5 Calendar|4 + 4 + 5 weeks]]. The final quarter has 14 weeks in it when there are 53 weeks in the year.\n\nWhen it is necessary to allocate a week to a single month, the rule for first week of the year might be applied, although ISO 8601 does not consider this case explicitly. The resulting pattern would be irregular. The only 4 months (or 5 in a long year) of 5 weeks would be those with at least 29 days starting on Thursday, those with at least 30 days starting on Wednesday, and those with 31 days starting on Tuesday.\n\n=== Dates with fixed week number ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Overview of dates with a fixed week number in any year other than a [[leap year starting on Thursday]]\n|-\n!

With the exception of leap years starting on Thursday, dates with fixed week numbers occur in all months of the year (for 1 day of each ISO week W01 to W52).\n\nDuring leap years starting on Thursday (i.e. the 13 years numbered 004, 032, 060, 088, 128, 156, 184, 224, 252, 280, 320, 348, 376 in a 400-year cycle), the ISO week numbers are incremented by 1 from March to the rest of the year. This last occurred in 1976 and 2004 and will not occur again before 2032. These exceptions are happening between years that are most often 28 years apart, or 40 years apart for 3 pairs of successive years: from year 088 to 128, from year 184 to 224, and from year 280 to 320.\n\nThe day of the week for these days are related to [[Doomsday (weekday)|the \u201cDoomsday\u201d algorithm]], which calculates the weekday that the last day of February falls on.\nThe dates listed in the table are all one day after the Doomsday, except that in January and February of leap years the dates themselves are Doomsdays. In leap years, the week number is [[Doomsday (weekday)#Overview of all Doomsdays|the rank number of its Doomsday]].\n\n=== Equal weeks ===\n\nSome pairs and triplets of ISO weeks have the same days of the month:\n\n* W02 and W41 in common years\n* W03 with W42 in common years and with W15 and W28 in leap years\n* W04 and W43 in common years and with W16 and W29 in leap years\n* W05 and W44 in common years\n* W06 with W10 and W45 in common years and with W32 in leap years\n* W07 with W11 and W46 in common years and with W33 in leap years\n* W08 with W12 and W47 in common years and with W34 in leap years\n* W10 and W45\n* W11 and W46\n* W12 and W47\n* W15 and W28\n* W16 and W29\n* W37 and W50\n* W38 and W51\n\nSome other weeks, i.e. W09, W19 through W26, W31 and W35<!--, W01, W13, W14, W17, W18, W27, W30, W36,W39, W40, W48, W49, W52 and W53?--> never share their days of the month ordinals with any other week of the same year.\n\n==Advantages==\n* All weeks have exactly 7 days, i.e. there are no fractional weeks.\n* Every week belongs to a single year, i.e. there are no ambiguous or double-assigned weeks.\n* The date directly tells the weekday.\n* All week-numbering years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday.\n* When used by itself without using the concept of month, all week-numbering years are the same except that some years have a week 53 at the end.\n* The weeks are the same as used with the Gregorian calendar.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nSolar astronomic phenomena, such as [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s, vary in the Gregorian calendar over a range spanning three days, over the course of each 400-year cycle, while the ISO Week Date calendar has a range spanning 9 days.  For example, there are March equinoxes on 1920-W12-6 and 2077-W11-5 in UT.\n\nThe year number of the ISO week very often differs from the Gregorian year number for dates close to 1&nbsp;January. For example, 29&nbsp;December 2014 is ISO&nbsp;2015-W01-1, i.e., it is in year&nbsp;2015 instead of 2014. A programming bug confusing these two year numbers is probably the cause of some [[Android (operating system)|Android]] users of [[Twitter]] being unable to log in around midnight of 29&nbsp;December 2014 [[UTC]].<ref name=\"theg_Twit\">{{Cite web |title=Twitter kicks Android app users out for five hours due to 2015 date bug |last=Hern |first=Alex |work=the Guardian |date=29 December 2014 |access-date=29 May 2019 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/29/twitter-2015-date-bug}}</ref>\n\nThe ISO week calendar relies on the [[Gregorian calendar]], which it augments, to define the new year day (Monday of week&nbsp;01). As a result, extra weeks are spread across the 400-year cycle in a complex, seemingly random pattern. There is no simple algorithm to determine whether a year has 53&nbsp;weeks from its ordinal number alone. Most [[calendar reform]] proposals using [[leap week calendar|leap week designs]] strive to simplify and harmonize this pattern, some by choosing a different [[leap year|leap cycle]] (e.g. 293 years).\n\nNot all parts of the world consider the week to begin with Monday. For example, in some Muslim countries, the normal work week begins on Saturday, while in Israel it begins on Sunday. In much of the Americas, although the work week is usually defined to start on Monday, the calendar week is often considered to start on Sunday.\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\n=== Calculating the week number from a month and day of the month or ordinal date ===\n\nThe week number (WW or ''woy'' for ''week of year'') of any date can be calculated, given its [[ordinal date]] (i.e. day of the year, ''doy'' or DDD, 1\u2013365 or 366) and its [[day of the week]] (D or ''dow'', 1\u20137). If the ordinal date is not known, it can be computed from the month (MM or ''moy'') and day of the month (DD or ''dom'') by any of several methods; e.g. using a table such as the following.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Offset for the day of the month to get ordinal day of the year\n!

An advantage is that no separate year numbering like the ISO year is needed. Correspondence of [[lexicographical order]] and chronological order is preserved (just like with the ISO year-week-weekday numbering), but partial weeks make some computations of weekly statistics or payments inaccurate at the end of December or the beginning of January or both.\n\nThe US [[broadcast calendar]] designates the week containing 1 January (and starting Monday) as the first of the year, but otherwise works like ISO week numbering without partial weeks. Up to six days of the previous December may be part of the first week of the year. \n\nA mix of those, wherein weeks start Sunday and all 1 January is part of the first one, is used in US accounting, resulting in a system with years having also 52 or 53 weeks.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/calendar/isocalendar.htm The Mathematics of the ISO 8601 Calendar]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/isowdcal.html ISO week date calendar]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/date_and_time_format.htm ISO Date and time format FAQ]\n\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n{{calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Weeks]]\n[[Category:Calendaring standards]]\n[[Category:Leap week calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Leap week calendar system}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Week date|Week|Week-day names|Week number}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020|talk=More citations needed}}\n\nThe '''ISO week date''' system is effectively a [[leap week calendar]] system that is part of the [[ISO 8601]] date and time standard issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) since 1988 (last revised in 2004) and, before that, it was defined in [[ISO 2015|ISO (R) 2015]] since 1971. It is used (mainly) in [[government]] and [[business]] for [[fiscal year]]s, as well as in timekeeping. This was previously known as \"Industrial date coding\". The system specifies a ''week year'' atop the [[Gregorian calendar]] by defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year.\n\nThe Gregorian [[leap cycle]], which has 97 leap days spread across 400 years, contains a whole number of weeks ({{val|20871}}). In every cycle there are 71 years with an additional 53rd week (corresponding to the Gregorian years that contain 53 Thursdays). An average year is exactly 52.1775 weeks long; months ({{frac|1|12}} year) average at exactly {{val|4.348125}} weeks.\n\nAn '''ISO week-numbering year''' (also called ''ISO year'' informally) has 52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 or 366 days. The extra week is sometimes referred to as a ''[[Leap week calendar|leap week]]'', although ISO 8601 does not use this term.\n\nWeeks start with Monday. Each week's year is the Gregorian year in which the Thursday falls. The first week of the year, hence, always [[ISO week date#First week|contains 4 January]]. ISO week [[year numbering]] therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days close to 1 January.\n\nA precise date is specified by the ISO week-numbering year in the format <var>YYYY</var>, a '''week number''' in the format <var>ww</var> prefixed by the letter 'W', and the '''weekday number''', a digit <var>d</var> from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday. For example, the Gregorian date Monday 23 December 2019 corresponds to Monday in the 52nd week of 2019, and is written 2019-W52-1 (in extended form) or 2019W521 (in compact form). The ISO year is slightly offset to the Gregorian year; for example, Monday 30 December 2019 in the Gregorian calendar is the first day of week 1 of 2020 in the ISO calendar, and is written as 2020-W01-1 or 2020W011.\n\n{{ISOCALENDAR|cdow=}}\n\n== Relation with the Gregorian calendar ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"{{float right}}; max-width: 50%;\"\n|+ Examples of contemporary dates around New Year\u2019s Day\n|-\n!

The days differing are a Friday through Sunday, or a Saturday and Sunday, or just a Sunday, at the start of the Gregorian year (which are at the end of the previous ISO year) and a Monday through Wednesday, or a Monday and Tuesday, or just a Monday, at the end of the Gregorian year (which are in week 01 of the next ISO year).

Hence the earliest possible first week extends from Monday 29 December (previous Gregorian year) to Sunday 4 January, the latest possible first week extends from Monday 4 January  to Sunday 10 January.\n* It has the year's first working day in it, if Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are not working days.\n\nIf '''1 January''' is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in W01. \nIf it is on a Friday, it is part of W53 of the previous year. \nIf it is on a Saturday, it is part of the last week of the previous year which is numbered W52 in a common year and W53 in a leap year. \nIf it is on a Sunday, it is part of W52 of the previous year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Dominical letter]](s) plus weekdays, dates and week numbers at the beginning and end of a year\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | Dominical<br>letter(s) \n! colspan=7 | Days at the beginning of January \n! colspan=4 | Effect \n! colspan=7 | Days at the end of December \n|-\n! style=\"width:4ex\" | 1<br>Mon || style=\"width:4ex\" | 2<br>Tue || style=\"width:4ex\" | 3<br>Wed || style=\"width:4ex\" | 4<br>Thu || style=\"width:4ex\" | 5<br>Fri || style=\"width:4ex\" | 6<br>Sat || style=\"width:4ex\" | 7<br>Sun \n! {{nobr|W01-1<sup>1</sup>}} !! 01 Jan week !! \u2026 !! 31 Dec week \n! title=\"First date of the last week of the year\" style=\"width:4ex\" | 1<br>Mon || 2<br>Tue || 3<br> Wed || 4<br>Thu || 5<br>Fri || 6<br>Sat || 7<br>Sun\n|-\n!

A date is either expressed with a month and day-of-the-month, or with a week and day-of-the-week, never a mix.\n\nWeeks are a prominent entity in accounting where annual statistics benefit from regularity throughout the [[fiscal year|year]]s. Therefore, in practice usually a fixed length of 13 weeks per [[fiscal quarter|quarter]] is chosen which is then subdivided into [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar|5 + 4 + 4 weeks]], [[Sym454|4 + 5 + 4 weeks]] or [[4-4-5 Calendar|4 + 4 + 5 weeks]]. The final quarter has 14 weeks in it when there are 53 weeks in the year.\n\nWhen it is necessary to allocate a week to a single month, the rule for first week of the year might be applied, although ISO 8601 does not consider this case explicitly. The resulting pattern would be irregular. The only 4 months (or 5 in a long year) of 5 weeks would be those with at least 29 days starting on Thursday, those with at least 30 days starting on Wednesday, and those with 31 days starting on Tuesday.\n\n=== Dates with fixed week number ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"{{float right}}\"\n|+ Overview of dates with a fixed week number in any year other than a [[leap year starting on Thursday]]\n|-\n!

With the exception of leap years starting on Thursday, dates with fixed week numbers occur in all months of the year (for 1 day of each ISO week W01 to W52).\n\nDuring leap years starting on Thursday (i.e. the 13 years numbered 004, 032, 060, 088, 128, 156, 184, 224, 252, 280, 320, 348, 376 in a 400-year cycle), the ISO week numbers are incremented by 1 from March to the rest of the year. This last occurred in 1976 and 2004 and will not occur again before 2032. These exceptions are happening between years that are most often 28 years apart, or 40 years apart for 3 pairs of successive years: from year 088 to 128, from year 184 to 224, and from year 280 to 320.\n\nThe day of the week for these days are related to [[Doomsday (weekday)|the \u201cDoomsday\u201d algorithm]], which calculates the weekday that the last day of February falls on.\nThe dates listed in the table are all one day after the Doomsday, except that in January and February of leap years the dates themselves are Doomsdays. In leap years, the week number is [[Doomsday (weekday)#Overview of all Doomsdays|the rank number of its Doomsday]].\n\n=== Equal weeks ===\n\nSome pairs and triplets of ISO weeks have the same days of the month:\n\n* W02 and W41 in common years\n* W03 with W42 in common years and with W15 and W28 in leap years\n* W04 and W43 in common years and with W16 and W29 in leap years\n* W05 and W44 in common years\n* W06 with W10 and W45 in common years and with W32 in leap years\n* W07 with W11 and W46 in common years and with W33 in leap years\n* W08 with W12 and W47 in common years and with W34 in leap years\n* W10 and W45\n* W11 and W46\n* W12 and W47\n* W15 and W28\n* W16 and W29\n* W37 and W50\n* W38 and W51\n\nSome other weeks, i.e. W09, W19 through W26, W31 and W35<!--, W01, W13, W14, W17, W18, W27, W30, W36,W39, W40, W48, W49, W52 and W53?--> never share their days of the month ordinals with any other week of the same year.\n\n==Advantages==\n* All weeks have exactly 7 days, i.e. there are no fractional weeks.\n* Every week belongs to a single year, i.e. there are no ambiguous or double-assigned weeks.\n* The date directly tells the weekday.\n* All week-numbering years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday.\n* When used by itself without using the concept of month, all week-numbering years are the same except that some years have a week 53 at the end.\n* The weeks are the same as used with the Gregorian calendar.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nSolar astronomic phenomena, such as [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s, vary in the Gregorian calendar over a range spanning three days, over the course of each 400-year cycle, while the ISO Week Date calendar has a range spanning 9 days.  For example, there are March equinoxes on 1920-W12-6 and 2077-W11-5 in UT.\n\nThe year number of the ISO week very often differs from the Gregorian year number for dates close to 1&nbsp;January. For example, 29&nbsp;December 2014 is ISO&nbsp;2015-W01-1, i.e., it is in year&nbsp;2015 instead of 2014. A programming bug confusing these two year numbers is probably the cause of some [[Android (operating system)|Android]] users of [[Twitter]] being unable to log in around midnight of 29&nbsp;December 2014 [[UTC]].<ref name=\"theg_Twit\">{{Cite web |title=Twitter kicks Android app users out for five hours due to 2015 date bug |last=Hern |first=Alex |work=the Guardian |date=29 December 2014 |access-date=29 May 2019 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/29/twitter-2015-date-bug}}</ref>\n\nThe ISO week calendar relies on the [[Gregorian calendar]], which it augments, to define the new year day (Monday of week&nbsp;01). As a result, extra weeks are spread across the 400-year cycle in a complex, seemingly random pattern. There is no simple algorithm to determine whether a year has 53&nbsp;weeks from its ordinal number alone. Most [[calendar reform]] proposals using [[leap week calendar|leap week designs]] strive to simplify and harmonize this pattern, some by choosing a different [[leap year|leap cycle]] (e.g. 293 years).\n\nNot all parts of the world consider the week to begin with Monday. For example, in some Muslim countries, the normal work week begins on Saturday, while in Israel it begins on Sunday. In much of the Americas, although the work week is usually defined to start on Monday, the calendar week is often considered to start on Sunday.\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\n=== Calculating the week number from a month and day of the month or ordinal date ===\n\nThe week number (WW or ''woy'' for ''week of year'') of any date can be calculated, given its [[ordinal date]] (i.e. day of the year, ''doy'' or DDD, 1\u2013365 or 366) and its [[day of the week]] (D or ''dow'', 1\u20137). If the ordinal date is not known, it can be computed from the month (MM or ''moy'') and day of the month (DD or ''dom'') by any of several methods; e.g. using a table such as the following.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Offset for the day of the month to get ordinal day of the year\n!

An advantage is that no separate year numbering like the ISO year is needed. Correspondence of [[lexicographical order]] and chronological order is preserved (just like with the ISO year-week-weekday numbering), but partial weeks make some computations of weekly statistics or payments inaccurate at the end of December or the beginning of January or both.\n\nThe US [[broadcast calendar]] designates the week containing 1 January (and starting Monday) as the first of the year, but otherwise works like ISO week numbering without partial weeks. Up to six days of the previous December may be part of the first week of the year. \n\nA mix of those, wherein weeks start Sunday and all 1 January is part of the first one, is used in US accounting, resulting in a system with years having also 52 or 53 weeks.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/calendar/isocalendar.htm The Mathematics of the ISO 8601 Calendar]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/isowdcal.html ISO week date calendar]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/date_and_time_format.htm ISO Date and time format FAQ]\n\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n{{calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Weeks]]\n[[Category:Calendaring standards]]\n[[Category:Leap week calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n", "name_user": "Sigurdhu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFirst week:Better fit on small screens.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date"}

Both domestic and wild grasses can help to protect the crops by attracting and trapping the [[stemborer]]s. The grasses are planted in the border around the maize and sorghum fields where invading adult moths become attracted to chemicals emitted by the grasses themselves. Instead of landing on the maize or sorghum plants, the insects head for what appears to be a tastier meal. These grasses provide the \"pull\" in the \"push\u2013pull\" strategy. They also serve as a haven for the borers' natural enemies. Good trap crops include well-known grasses such as Napier grass (''[[Pennisetum purpureum]]'') and Sudan grass (''[[Sorghum]] vulgare sudanense''). Napier grass has a particularly effective way of defending itself against the pests: once attacked by a borer larva, it secretes a sticky substance which physically traps the pest and limits its damage.\n\n== The push ==\nThe \"push\" in the intercropping scheme is provided by the plants that emit chemicals ([[kairomone]]s) which repel [[stemborer]] moths and drive them away from the main crop (maize or sorghum). The best candidates discovered so far with the repellent properties are species of leguminous genus ''Desmodium''. ''[[Desmodium]]'' is planted in between the rows of maize or sorghum. Being a low-growing plant, it does not interfere with the crops' growth and, furthermore, has the advantage of maintaining soil stability, improving [[soil fertility]] through enhanced [[soil organic matter]] content and nitrogen fixation. It also serves as a highly nutritious animal feed and effectively suppresses striga weeds. Another plant showing good repellent properties is molasses grass (''[[Melinis minutiflora]]''), a nutritious animal feed with tick-repelling and stemborer larval parasitoid attractive properties.\n\n== How push\u2013pull works ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n\nPush\u2013pull technology involves use of behaviour-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, agrobiodiversity, plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent intercrop such as ''[[Desmodium uncinatum]]'' (silverleaf)<ref>Glover et al., \"Plant perennials to save Africa's soils\", ''Nature'' 489, 359\u2013361 (20 September 2012)</ref> (push), with an attractive trap plant such as [[Napier grass]] (pull) planted as a border crop around this intercrop. Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces significantly higher levels of attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum.

Both domestic and wild grasses can help to protect the crops by attracting and trapping the [[stemborer]]s. The grasses are planted in the border around the maize and sorghum fields where invading adult moths become attracted to chemicals emitted by the grasses themselves. Instead of landing on the maize or sorghum plants, the insects head for what appears to be a tastier meal. These grasses provide the \"pull\" in the \"push\u2013pull\" strategy. They also serve as a haven for the borers' natural enemies. Good trap crops include well-known grasses such as Napier grass (''[[Pennisetum purpureum]]'') and Sudan grass (''[[Sorghum]] vulgare sudanense''). Napier grass has a particularly effective way of defending itself against the pests: once attacked by a borer larva, it secretes a sticky substance which physically traps the pest and limits its damage.\n\n== The push ==\nThe \"push\" in the intercropping scheme is provided by the plants that emit chemicals ([[kairomone]]s) which repel [[stemborer]] moths and drive them away from the main crop (maize or sorghum). The best candidates discovered so far with the repellent properties are species of leguminous genus ''Desmodium''. ''[[Desmodium]]'' is planted in between the rows of maize or sorghum. Being a low-growing plant, it does not interfere with the crops' growth and, furthermore, has the advantage of maintaining soil stability, improving [[soil fertility]] through enhanced [[soil organic matter]] content and nitrogen fixation. It also serves as a highly nutritious animal feed and effectively suppresses striga weeds. Another plant showing good repellent properties is molasses grass (''[[Melinis minutiflora]]''), a nutritious animal feed with tick-repelling and stemborer larval parasitoid attractive properties.\n\n== How push\u2013pull works ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n\nPush\u2013pull technology involves use of behaviour-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, agrobiodiversity, plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent intercrop such as ''[[Desmodium uncinatum]]'' (silverleaf)<ref>Glover et al., \"Plant perennials to save Africa's soils\", ''Nature'' 489, 359\u2013361 (20 September 2012)</ref> (push), with an attractive trap plant such as [[Napier grass]] (pull) planted as a border crop around this intercrop. Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces significantly higher levels of attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum. There is also an increase of approximately 100-fold in the total amounts of these compounds produced in the first hour of nightfall by Napier grass (scotophase), the period at which stemborer moths seek host plants for laying eggs, causing the differential oviposition preference. However, many of the stemborer larvae, about 80%, do not survive, as Napier grass tissues produce sticky sap in response to feeding by the larvae, which traps them, causing the death of about 80% of larvae.<ref name=\":0\" /> Legumes in the genus ''Desmodium'' (silverleaf, ''D. uncinatum'' and greenleaf, ''[[Desmodium intortum|D. intortum]]''), on the other hand, produce repellent volatile chemicals that push away the stemborer moths.

Most of the songs he sang were written by [[Ramprasad Sen]] and [[Kamalakanta Bhattacharya (West Bengal)|Kamalakanta Bhattacharya]], both of whom were [[Shakta]] poets of [[Bengal]]. He was eight years younger than his elder brother [[Dhananjay Bhattacharya]]. He developed a special style of singing, [[Shyama Sangeet]], that continues to be used. He committed suicide at the age of 36.Pannalal Bhattacharya is the evergreen singer of Bengali music industry.Pannalal Bhattacharya is a great Matri Bhakta.\n\n==His childhood==\nVery little is known about his background. Even the Bengali 'C\u0105ritavidan' does not provide adequate information about his early life or  childhood.  He was born in Bally, Barendrapara, Howrah and spent most of his life there.\n\n==First appearance==\nPannalal started singing in 1947, at the age of 17, with another renowned musician, Sanat Sinha. His elder brother Prafulla took them both to a program, where none of them were allowed to sing because of the immaturity in their voices. They encountered the same problem at [[HMV]]. They got their first break in Megaphone. At first Pannalal sang modern Bengali songs, until Bishwanath Kumar, a friend of Sanat Sinha signed him for his first hit Shyama sangeet, \"Aamar sadh na mitilo aasha na purilo, sokoli phuraye jay ma...\" (None of my desires were fulfilled, nor my hopes have come true, O mother...). This rendition is now acclaimed as a classic in Bengal. However, \"Aamar Sadhna mitilo\" wasn't Pannalal's first Shyama sangeet record. His earlier and popular songs include \"Aamar Mayer Paye Jaba Hoye\", \"Tui naki Ma Dayamayee\", Tui je Kemon Dayamayee\", \"Sakali Tomari Ichha\", \"Amay De Ma Pagal Kore\", \"Muchiye De Ma Aamar a Duti Nayan\", \"Moneri basona shyama\" among others.\n\n==Personal life==\nPannalal was married and cared well for his family until his death in 1966.

His distinct voice and a spirit filled with devotion have touched the hearts of countless devotees of Mother Kali across Bengal. He became a great devotee of goddess [[Kali]] and always remained engrossed in her thoughts. Pannalal and his elder brother Dhananjay  Bhattacharya, another eminent singer of [[Shyama Sangeet]], wanted to please Kali by offering her their songs.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful [[Aspect (religion)|aspect]] that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In [[Egypt]], she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC. The face of a woman with the horns and ears of a cow, representing Hathor or [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], appears twice at the top of the palette and in a row below the belt of the king.]]\n[[File:Narmer palette 83d40m hathor atop columns below belt of king.png|thumb|right|Detail on the Narmar Palette below the belt of the king shows Hathor atop four columns]]\nImages of [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|cattle]] appear frequently in the [[art of ancient Egypt|artwork]] of [[Predynastic Egypt]] (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans of all ages with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the [[Festival of Drunkenness]] as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or [[Isis]] stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most [[Egyptologists]] who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented his mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that [[Egyptian queens]] often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the ''naos'' sistrum shape above the goddess's head.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Hathor Amulet MET DP136527.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|Amulet of Hathor as a [[uraeus]] wearing a ''naos'' headdress, early to mid-first millennium BC\nFile:Hathor's head.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women.

During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor.

Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}}\n\nHathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' in the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}} Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction]].{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Au\u00f0umbla]], a primeval cow in Norse mythology\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Assmann | first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Assmann |others= Translated by David Lorton | title=Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rL2y0T6ukuYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher= Cornell University Press | year =2005 |origyear= German edition 2001 | isbn = 978-0801442414 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Billing |author-first=Nils |title=Writing an Image: The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 |journal=Studien zur Alt\u00e4gyptischen Kultur |volume=32 |pages=35\u201350 |date=2004 |jstor=25152905 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bleeker |first=C.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful [[Aspect (religion)|aspect]] that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In Egypt, she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC.

Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans of all ages with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the Festival of Drunkenness as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or [[Isis]] stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most Egyptologists who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented his mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that Egyptian queens often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the ''naos'' sistrum shape above the goddess's head.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Hathor Amulet MET DP136527.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|Amulet of Hathor as a [[uraeus]] wearing a ''naos'' headdress, early to mid-first millennium BC\nFile:Hathor's head.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women. The columns, walls, and ceiling are covered in painted reliefs.|[[Hypostyle]] hall of the [[Temple of Hathor at Dendera]], first century AD]]\nMore temples were dedicated to Hathor than to any other Egyptian goddess.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} During the Old Kingdom her most important center of worship was in the region of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], where \"Hathor of the Sycomore\" was worshipped at many sites throughout the [[Memphite Necropolis]]. During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=227}} After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=83}} Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\nIn the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}}\n\nHathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' in the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}} Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction]].{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Au\u00f0umbla]], a primeval cow in Norse mythology\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Assmann | first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Assmann |others= Translated by David Lorton | title=Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rL2y0T6ukuYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher= Cornell University Press | year =2005 |origyear= German edition 2001 | isbn = 978-0801442414 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Billing |author-first=Nils |title=Writing an Image: The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 |journal=Studien zur Alt\u00e4gyptischen Kultur |volume=32 |pages=35\u201350 |date=2004 |jstor=25152905 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bleeker |first=C.
