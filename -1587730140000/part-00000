Its speed allowed troops to give 120 steps per minute (double the average of a regular unit, hence its name). This march gave rise to a traditional Spanish [[dance]], a musical genre including both voice and instruments, and a genre of instrumental music often played during [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]. Both the dance and the non martial compositions are also called pasodoble.\n\n== Structure ==\nAll pasodobles have [[binary rhythm]]. Its musical structure consists of an introduction based on the dominant chord of the piece, followed by a first fragment based on the main tone and a second part, called \"the tr\u00edo\", based on the sub-dominant note, based yet again on the dominant chord. Each change is preceded by a brieph. The last segment of the pasodoble is usually \"the tr\u00edo\" strongly played.<ref>[[Ram\u00f3n T. Berenguer]], pasodoble composer.</ref>\nThe different types of pasodoble- popular, taurino, militar- can vary in rhythm, with the taurine pasodobles being the slowest and the popular being faster and often incorporating voice.\nPasodoble as we know it started in Spain but is now played in a wide variety of Hispanic nations. Each region has developed their own subgenre and personal style of pasodoble, adjusting some formal aspects of the structure to fit their local musical tradition.<ref>Berenguer Gonz\u00e1lez, Ram\u00f3n T. (2008). \"Pasodobles de Espa\u00f1a\".</ref>\nIn modern Spain the most prolific composition of pasodobles is happening in the Levantine coast, associated to the festivals of [[Moros y cristianos|Moors and Christians]].\n\nThe dance is very free regarding figures. The dancers must remain one in front of the other, and keep their bodies parallel to each other at all times, lining slightly to the left. They must give one step per tempo. The left hand of the male and the right hand of the woman must remain united almost permanently. Besides this almost all motions and figures are accepted, which allows space for dramatization. The dance can be similar to the one-step, except for the speed and number of steps given.\n\n== History ==\n===Origin===\nThe origin of this passionate form of music is disputed.\n\nThe facts known about it due to physical historical evidence are that it was being written as early as the 1780, since Spain has partitures preserved dating back to the 1780, that the 18th century, it was incorporated into comedies and adopted as a regulatory step for the Spanish infantry, and that the music was introduced to bullfights in the 19th century.\n\nOne hypothesis suggests, based on the etymology of the name, that it comes from the French \"pas-redouble\", a form of speedy march of the French infantry during the late 18th century. The pasodoble came from a French military march with the name \"Paso Redoble\". It has both Spanish and French characteristics. The steps often contain French terms, but the dance resembles the nature of the bullfight. It is believed to have emerged from southern French culture during the 1930s. Supporters of this hypothesis, mostly French musicologists, suggested that pasodoble was a way for the French to portray the techniques used in Spanish bullfights. This hypothesis neglects to explain the presence of partitures dating from 1780, that Spanish infantry already marched at doble speed before the French army did-albeit they did call this speed \"forced march\", not \"doble step\"- and the fact that the oldest forms of pasodoble have confrontation elements, like most Spanish dances, but don't have bullfight-related movements or themes.\n\nA hypothesis based on the dance's free figures and rhythm states that it's binary rhythm and moderated movement points to an origin in traditional Spanish music and dances of the early 16th century. This dances, developed around 1538, were a gradual combination of Castillian music and dance ([[seguidillas]]) with the \"[[garrot\u00edn]]\", a fast and repetitive Romani couples dance.\n\nFamous musicologists Jos\u00e9 Subir\u00e1 considers that the origin of the tune was a combination of military marches and light music from Spanish popular theater that gradually permeated the \"entremeses\" of more respectable plays.<ref>Romero Ferrer, Alberto & Moreno Meng\u00edbar, Andr\u00e9s: Manuel Garc\u00eda: de la tonadilla esc\u00e9nica a la \u00f3pera espa\u00f1ola (1775-1832)</ref>\n\n===Others===\nFamous bullfighters have been honored with pasodoble tunes named for them. Other tunes have been inspired by patriotic motifs or local characters. The pasodoble is well-known and used today for dance competitions.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the pasodoble became part of the repertoire of [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] musicians in San Francisco playing in the ''[[ballo liscio]]'' style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mignano Crawford |first1=Sheri |title=Mandolin Melodies |date=2008 |publisher=Zighi Baci |location=Petaluma, CA |isbn=978-0976372233 |pages=11\u201313 |edition=3rd}}</ref> Four pasodobles were collected by [[Sidney Robertson Cowell]] for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] California Folk Music Project in 1939 by [[Mexican American]] wedding party band on [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], and [[violin]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cowell |first1=Sidney Robertson |title=Search results for California Gold: Northern California Folk Music from the Thirties Collected by Sidney Robertson Cowell, Pasodoble, Available Online |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/sidney-robertson-cowell-northern-california-folk-music/?q=pasodoble |website=California Gold: Northern California Folk Music from the Thirties Collected by Sidney Robertson Cowell |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Types of pasodoble ==\n\n=== By objective===\n=====March pasodoble=====\nAlso called \"military pasodoble\", it was created as, or keeps its role as, an infantry march. It is usually fast and lacks lyrics.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB13pUiHNKg</ref> Famous examples are \"Soldadito espa\u00f1ol\", \"El Abanico\", \"Los nardos\", \"Las Corsarias\" or \" Los Voluntarios\"\n\n=====Taurine pasodoble=====\nOften played during bullfights, or with that intense atmosphere in mind. They are slowed and more dramatic than martial pasodobles, and lack lyrics too. This pasodoble is based on music played at [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]s during the bullfighters' entrance (''paseo''), or during the passes (''faena'') just before the kill. It is also composed to honor outstanding bullfighters.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqtbzbvsdLg</ref> Some of the most famous are  Suspiros de Espa\u00f1a, Espa\u00f1a ca\u00f1\u00ed, Ag\u00fcero, La Gracia de Dios,1 El Gato Mont\u00e9s, Viva el pasodoble, Tercio de Quites, Pan y toros, Cielo Andaluz, La Morena de mi Copla, Francisco Alegre, Amparito Roca, El Beso, Plaza de las Ventas.\n\n=====Popular pasodoble=====\nMade to dance in popular celebrations and social reunions. They tend to be upbeat, but can also be emotional and introspective, with the occasional melancholic or patriotic theme. They usually require a small number of instruments and musicians and have lyrics.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiaM8cX_kbA</ref> Some famous examples are \"Islas Canarias\", \"En er Mundo\", \"Costa Dorada\" or \"Valencia\".\n\n=====Band pasodoble=====\nPasodobles that require an entire band to be played, and are almost exclusively designed for popular dances and village celebrations. They often use colorful characters of the region and light hearted subjects as inspiration. This pasodobles are very alive in Spain. Even though not much is being composed, the traditional ones can be heard in Spanish popular celebrations, patron sain verbenas, and wedding. They can be danced in very large groups instead of as couples.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soiyPl-S8dw</ref> Well known examples are \"Paquito el Chocolatero\", \"Fiesta en Benidorm\", \" Alegr\u00eda Agostense\" or \"Pirata Quiero Ser\".\n\n=====Display pasodoble=====\nA pasodoble performed mostly for spectacle purposes, sometimes in a bullfighting ring. This pasodoble may or may not have lyrics, but it often adapts other style of pasodoble and just changes the dancing to make it more spectacular for the public-often tourists. Essentially, this pasodoble dance involves role-playing. This two-person dance form has the man performing as the bullfighter and the woman as the cape.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4DPEEQZagM</ref> It is known as one of the fastest Latin ballroom dances because dancers make around 120 to 130 beats/steps per minute. In some versions, the man portrays the [[matador]] in the dance, and the woman portrays the bull. [[flamenco]]-like qualities infuse the dance as the man and woman challenge each other. [[File:Banda copia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Amparito Roca being played by a wind band|alt=El pasodoble Amparito Roca interpretado por la Banda de Zestoa en las fiestas de 2010]]\nThe leader of this dance plays the part of the matador. The follower generally plays the part of the matador's cape, but can also represent the shadow of the matador, as well as the flamenco dancer in some figures. The follower never represents the bull, although this is a common misconception.\nThis form of pasodoble is a lively style of dance to the [[Metre (music)|duple meter]] [[march (music)|march]]-like music, and is often performed in the context of theater. This form of pasodoble was mistakenly taken as the original form by English and French musicologists visiting Spain in the 20th century.\n\n=====Tunas=====\n[[Tunas]] is the name given to a brotherhood of students that play popular music together on the street to get some extra coins, or under the window of the beloved of one of them, to try and help the lovestruck member to get a date with her. Tunas have become one of the main forces keeping Spanish pasodoble alive. Tunas tend to adapt or repeat simple pieces that are already composed, but they sometimes compose their own, satyrical pieces.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFzCByzNcKU\n</ref>\n\n=== By region===\nIn addition to the Spanish pasodoble, already discussed, this rhythm has been adopted and modified by other nations:\n\n=====Mexican pasodoble=====\nMexico has produced master composers of pasodoble, especially taurine pasodobles. [[Agust\u00edn Lara]] or [[Silverio P\u00e9rez]]. Some of the best known Mexican pasodobles are\n\nEl Piti, El Charro C\u00e1rdenas, El abuelito, El banderillero, Mar\u00eda Caball\u00e9, El Berrendito de San Juan, Tarde de toros, Toros en San Miguel, Joselito Huerta and Toros de Llaguno.\n\n=====Puerto Rican pasodobles=====\nPuerto Rican pasodobles are known for their nostalgic quality.\nSome of the most famous are: Ecos de Puerto Rico (El Maestro Ladi),  Morena ([[Noro Morales]]), Cuando pienso en Espa\u00f1a (Juan Pe\u00f1a Reyes), Reminiscencias (Juan Pe\u00f1a Reyes), El trueno ([[Juan Pe\u00f1a Reyes]]), Himno a Humacao (Miguel L\u00f3pez), Sol andaluz (Manuel Pe\u00f1a V\u00e1zquez).\n\n=====Colombian pasodobles=====\nPasodoble isn't as popular in Colombia as in other countries, but the Colombia pasodoble, \"Feria de Manizales\", is an emblematic piece. It was composed in 1957, with lyrics by Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Ospina and music by Juan Mari Asins. This pasodoble is based on the development of a parade and a dance withevery single \"queen of the city\" of Manizales, and it lasts one week.\n\n=====Spanish pasodobles =====\n\n*''[[Amparito Roca]]''\n*''El Beso''\n*''La Entrada''\n*''[[El gato mont\u00e9s]]'' (\"Wild Cat\") from the [[opera]] with the same name\n*''El Relicario''\n*''Ag\u00fcero''\n*''[[Espa\u00f1a ca\u00f1\u00ed]]'' (\"Gypsy Spain\")\n*''Islas Canarias'' named after [[Canary Islands]].\n*''La Gracia de Dios''<ref>Berenguer Gonzalez, Ram\u00f3n T.

The song has breaks or \"highlights\" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels,{{clarify|date=November 2010}} three highlights and a longer song at open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful than other parts of the music. Usually, dancers strike a dramatic pose and then hold position until the end of the highlight. Traditionally, pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the [[musical phrase]]s. Accordingly, most ballroom pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in competition).\n\nBecause of its heavily choreographed tradition, ballroom pasodoble is danced mostly competitively, almost never socially, or without a previously learned routine. That said, in [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Vietnam]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]] and some parts of [[Germany]], it is danced socially as a led (unchoreographed) dance. In [[Venezuela]], pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties. It became especially famous thanks to the hit song \"Guitarra Espa\u00f1ola\" by [[Los Mel\u00f3dicos]].\n\nThis dance gained popularity in the US in 1930. It was too difficult to achieve widespread popularity. All moves are sharp and quick. Pasodoble takes up a lot of space, limiting it to special occasions.\n\nIn competitive dance, modern pasodoble is combined with other four dances ([[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], [[Ballroom rumba|rumba]] and [[Jive (dance)|jive]]) under the banner [[International Latin]]. Modern pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the [[IDS Scheer|IDSF]] classification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worlddancesport.org/|title=All about DanceSport at World DanceSport Federation on worlddancesport.org|website=www.worlddancesport.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of the Latin-American Program.\n\n[[File:Pasedoble Galaball2011.jpg|thumb|Pasedoble Galaball2011]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military step]]\n*[[Latin dance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Amparito Roca Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcnQqK6-qCc Note that while this Wikipedia article specifies a tempo of no more than 120 beats per minute for a Paso Doble, this performance is much faster, at about 156 beats per minute.\n* Amparito Roca Audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5BaunXbM-U This authentic interpretation by the Municipal Band of Madrid is performed at about 108 beats per minute.\n* [http://www.manuel-lillo.com.es Maestro Manuel Lillo] '''Plaza de las Ventas' Score''\n* {{Cite news|url=http://bellaballroom.com/dance-classes/paso-doble/|title=Paso Doble - Bella Ballroom Dance Studio|work=Bella Ballroom|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US}}\n* {{Cite web|url=https://delta.dance/2015/01/paso-doble-spanish-dance-france/|title=Paso Doble: the Spanish dance from France {{!}} Delta.Dance|last=Pytlik|first=George|website=delta.dance|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-03}}\n\n{{Dance}}\n{{Music of Spain}}\n{{Music in Spanish}}\n\n[[Category:Military marches]]\n[[Category:Ballroom dance]]\n[[Category:Latin dances]]\n[[Category:Spanish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Spanish folk music]]\n[[Category:Spanish music]]\n[[Category:Bullfighting]]\n[[Category:Dance forms in classical music]]\n[[Category:Spanish dances]]\n[[Category:Dance terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Spanish dance and music genre|the German NDW band|Paso Doble (band)|the Romanian film|Pas \u00een doi|the song by Ringo Starr, \"Pasodobles\"|Liverpool 8}}\n{{Expand Spanish|date=March 2018|Pasodoble}}{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}[[File:Morosviejos.jpg|thumb|''Festeros'' parading Pasodoble as a military march]]\n[[File:Anna CAPPELLINI Luca LANOTTE 2009WC - CD.jpg|thumb|right|Pasodoble on ice: [[Luca Lanotte]] & [[Anna Cappellini]]]]\n[[File:Cartel toros barcelona.jpg|thumb|260px|Poster for a bull fight in Barcelona]]\n\n'''Pasodoble''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''double step'') is a fast-paced Spanish military march used by infantry troops.

This pasodoble is based on the development of a parade and a dance withevery single \"queen of the city\" of Manizales, and it lasts one week.\n\n=====Spanish pasodobles =====\n\n*''[[Amparito Roca]]''\n*''El Beso''\n*''La Entrada''\n*''[[El gato mont\u00e9s]]'' (\"Wild Cat\") from the [[opera]] with the same name\n*''El Relicario''\n*''Ag\u00fcero''\n*''[[Espa\u00f1a ca\u00f1\u00ed]]'' (\"Gypsy Spain\")\n*''Islas Canarias'' named after [[Canary Islands]].\n*''La Gracia de Dios''<ref>Berenguer Gonzalez, Ram\u00f3n T.

The song has breaks or \"highlights\" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels,{{clarify|date=November 2010}} three highlights and a longer song at open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful than other parts of the music. Usually, dancers strike a dramatic pose and then hold position until the end of the highlight. Traditionally, pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the [[musical phrase]]s. Accordingly, most ballroom pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in competition).\n\nBecause of its heavily choreographed tradition, ballroom pasodoble is danced mostly competitively, almost never socially, or without a previously learned routine. That said, in [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Vietnam]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]] and some parts of [[Germany]], it is danced socially as a led (unchoreographed) dance. In [[Venezuela]], pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties. It became especially famous thanks to the hit song \"Guitarra Espa\u00f1ola\" by [[Los Mel\u00f3dicos]].\n\nThis dance gained popularity in the US in 1930. It was too difficult to achieve widespread popularity. All moves are sharp and quick. Pasodoble takes up a lot of space, limiting it to special occasions.\n\nIn competitive dance, modern pasodoble is combined with other four dances ([[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], [[Ballroom rumba|rumba]] and [[Jive (dance)|jive]]) under the banner [[International Latin]]. Modern pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the [[IDS Scheer|IDSF]] classification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worlddancesport.org/|title=All about DanceSport at World DanceSport Federation on worlddancesport.org|website=www.worlddancesport.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of the Latin-American Program.\n\n[[File:Pasedoble Galaball2011.jpg|thumb|Pasedoble Galaball2011]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military step]]\n*[[Latin dance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Amparito Roca Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcnQqK6-qCc Note that while this Wikipedia article specifies a tempo of no more than 120 beats per minute for a Paso Doble, this performance is much faster, at about 156 beats per minute.\n* Amparito Roca Audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5BaunXbM-U This authentic interpretation by the Municipal Band of Madrid is performed at about 108 beats per minute.\n* [http://www.manuel-lillo.com.es Maestro Manuel Lillo] '''Plaza de las Ventas' Score''\n* {{Cite news|url=http://bellaballroom.com/dance-classes/paso-doble/|title=Paso Doble - Bella Ballroom Dance Studio|work=Bella Ballroom|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US}}\n* {{Cite web|url=https://delta.dance/2015/01/paso-doble-spanish-dance-france/|title=Paso Doble: the Spanish dance from France {{!}} Delta.Dance|last=Pytlik|first=George|website=delta.dance|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-03}}\n\n{{Dance}}\n{{Music of Spain}}\n{{Music in Spanish}}\n\n[[Category:Military marches]]\n[[Category:Ballroom dance]]\n[[Category:Latin dances]]\n[[Category:Spanish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Spanish folk music]]\n[[Category:Spanish music]]\n[[Category:Bullfighting]]\n[[Category:Dance forms in classical music]]\n[[Category:Spanish dances]]\n[[Category:Dance terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Anypodetos", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDisplay pasodoble:less surprising links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasodoble"}

The bridges were designed by engineering staff of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and built in 1870 by day labour. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1064>{{cite NSW SHR|5012261|Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|hr=01064|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBy the early 1900s the original single track from [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nNormally the {{convert|6.1|m|ft|0|adj=on}} clear span would have been bridged by a simple steel plate web girder, but the shortage of steel meant a continuance of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nThis bridge is easily accessible via Springvale Lane which is off the [[Mudgee]] Road, south-east of the [[Wallerawang Power Station]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is a significant technical accomplishment. It has seventeen stone arch [[Span (architecture)|spans]] totalling {{convert|139.6|m|ft|0}} and is the longest masonry arch bridge ever built in Australia. Its main span of {{convert|16.5|m|ft|0}} is also large, being the fifth longest of its type for its age (1870). It is also unusual in having an elliptical arch rib. The main span is flanked by stone [[buttress]]es or [[columns]] which extend above the deck. The treatment of the [[spandrel]] is unusual in that the radial joints of the arch rib are extended out to fill the entire spandrel space The bridge is thus an integral part of a section of the New South Wales rail system of immense historical significance.<ref name=RNE>Register of the National Estate.</ref>\n\nThe brick double track underbridge over Coxs River, 1923.<ref name=nswshr-1064/><ref name=RNE/>\n\nThe bridge retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 March 2006, this 1870 bridge is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with [[John Whitton]] the \"father of New South Wales railways\", it is an impressive sandstone structure on the outskirts of historic Wallerawang, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and the extension west to Wallerawang. It is the largest of Whitton's stone arch viaducts. It is a fine representative example of a stone arch railway viaduct and it retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nWallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThis bridge is part of the Bowenfels to Wallerawang duplication, the last of such works dominated by brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe duplication work contributed significantly to the railway extension to Bathurst and to the continued development of Western New South Wales, for land transport to [[Sydney]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe brick arch was still the most common form of railway bridge in the early 1920s due to the shortage of steel after World War I.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is a good representative example of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Coxs River railway bridges, Wallerangang}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=Rail Infrastructure Corporation|date=2003|title=Rail Infrastructure Corporation s.170 Register|number=}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|dno=5012261|id=01064|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n{{City of Lithgow topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:1870 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1870]]\n[[Category:Main Western railway line, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Wallerawang]]\n[[Category:Works of John Whitton]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River SHRNo:1064 DatabaseNo:5012261 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox bridge\n| name                = Coxs River railway bridges\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| image               = 1064 -

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1064>{{cite NSW SHR|5012261|Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|hr=01064|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBy the early 1900s the original single track from [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nNormally the {{convert|6.1|m|ft|0|adj=on}} clear span would have been bridged by a simple steel plate web girder, but the shortage of steel meant a continuance of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nThis bridge is easily accessible via Springvale Lane which is off the [[Mudgee]] Road, south-east of the [[Wallerawang Power Station]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is a significant technical accomplishment. It has seventeen stone arch [[Span (architecture)|spans]] totalling {{convert|139.6|m|ft|0}} and is the longest masonry arch bridge ever built in Australia. Its main span of {{convert|16.5|m|ft|0}} is also large, being the fifth longest of its type for its age (1870). It is also unusual in having an elliptical arch rib. The main span is flanked by stone [[buttress]]es or [[columns]] which extend above the deck. The treatment of the [[spandrel]] is unusual in that the radial joints of the arch rib are extended out to fill the entire spandrel space The bridge is thus an integral part of a section of the New South Wales rail system of immense historical significance.<ref name=RNE>Register of the National Estate.</ref>\n\nThe brick double track underbridge over Coxs River, 1923.<ref name=nswshr-1064/><ref name=RNE/>\n\nThe bridge retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 March 2006, this 1870 bridge is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with [[John Whitton]] the \"father of New South Wales railways\", it is an impressive sandstone structure on the outskirts of historic Wallerawang, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and the extension west to Wallerawang. It is the largest of Whitton's stone arch viaducts. It is a fine representative example of a stone arch railway viaduct and it retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nWallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThis bridge is part of the Bowenfels to Wallerawang duplication, the last of such works dominated by brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe duplication work contributed significantly to the railway extension to Bathurst and to the continued development of Western New South Wales, for land transport to [[Sydney]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe brick arch was still the most common form of railway bridge in the early 1920s due to the shortage of steel after World War I.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is a good representative example of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Coxs River railway bridges, Wallerangang}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=Rail Infrastructure Corporation|date=2003|title=Rail Infrastructure Corporation s.170 Register|number=}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|dno=5012261|id=01064|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n{{City of Lithgow topics|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:1870 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1870]]\n[[Category:Main Western railway line, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Wallerawang]]\n[[Category:Works of John Whitton]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttribution:{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxs_River_railway_bridges,_Wallerawang"}

When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\".

According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field. Argentina was trashed [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] (8\u20132), [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), Uruguay (4\u20130), Chile (6\u20132) and Brazil (3\u20130).

Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team. Argentina made a poor performance at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], being defeated by England (3\u20131) to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn the [[1963 South American Championship]], Argentina finished third in the tournament, although the team achieved important victories over Brazil (3\u20130), Ecuador and Colombia, but lost to Bolivia and Peru. That same year, Argentina was also defeated by Brazil in the Roca Cup.\n\n===Nation's Cup===\n[[File:Seleccion argentina 1964.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The team that won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]] in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Argentina won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]], a friendly tournament organized by the Brazilian Association to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

The team shared their group with Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia. Argentina finished the round unbeaten with three matches won and two draws. Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England. Argentina only drew the first two games and was defeated in the last in Torino.\n\n[[File:Argentina 1966 rattin.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] (#10) was sent off by referee Kreitlein in the match against England.]]\nArgentina made its debut in Group 2 of the World Cup, defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by 2\u20131. The next matches were against West Germany, which ended 0\u20130 and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] also won by 2\u20131. Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave. As a way to show his disgust, he sat on the red carpet exclusively meant for the Queen to walk on. He eventually had to be escorted from the field by two policemen and as a final sign of disgust, wrinkled at a British pennant before being escorted out. This incident, and others surrounding the same game, arguably started the long-lasting rivalry between both national teams, although on the other hand, allowed for the institution of yellow and red cards into football, a solution devised by FIFA after the spark that set off the incident.\n\nAlthough Argentina did not have a great performance in England, the players were well received by the crowd in Ezeiza, in part due to the incident with Ratt\u00edn and the Queen's carpet, where Ratt\u00edn himself later saying that he \"didn't know where he had sat on\".<ref name=transition>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7861%3Ala-transicion-hacia-la-organizacion&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"La transici\u00f3n hacia la organizaci\u00f3n\", AFA website: Historia de la Selecci\u00f3n Argentina]</ref>\n\nThe next step for the team was the [[1967 South American Championship|1967 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], hosted by Uruguay. Argentina made a good campaign, winning five over six matches disputed, being defeated only by the host team and finished second.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1969, the Football Association named four different coaches to the national team: Carmelo Faraone, who only coached two matches, [[Renato Cesarini]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Minella|Jos\u00e9 M. Minella]], [[Humberto Maschio]] and [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. In those years, Argentina played a series of friendly matches with most of them being South American teams and a few European teams. Argentina also played a new edition of the [[Copa Lipton|Lipton Cup]], obtaining it by goal average over Uruguay.\n\nIn 1969, Argentina began qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] under Pedernera. The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.  This poor performance that caused the absence of a national representative in the 1970 World Cup is still regarded as one of Argentina's biggest frustrations in its history.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-40394-2004-08-31.html \"A 35 a\u00f1os de un fat\u00eddico empate contra los peruanos\", ''P\u00e1gina/12''], August 31, 2004</ref>\n\nAfter the frustration of 1969, the Association named [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Pizzuti]], who had won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] with [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] three years before, as coach of the national team. Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130). Brazil qualified to the next stage and the national team was eliminated.\n\n[[File:Argentina1978.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Argentina host the FIFA World Cup for the first time in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]]].\nIn 1978, the final preparations for the World Cup began, playing several matches against South American and European teams. Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history. Nevertheless, other journalists assert that there were too many offensive midfielders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%C2%B478/ |title=\"Maradona y el Mundial 78\" |access-date=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022131351/http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%c2%b478/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passarella world cup.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team captain [[Daniel Passarella]] holding the World Cup trophy.]]\nArgentina finally debuted on 2 June 1978 against Hungary, winning 2\u20131.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy).

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

Some journalists also accused Bilardo to play defensively, leaving behind the historic Argentine landmark of short passes and dribblings according to their point of view. ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v. [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at the Estadio Olimpico Universitario in Mexico City.]]\nArgentina entered the 1986 World Cup with hope because of one player, Diego Maradona. Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw. The last group game was against Bulgaria, which resulted in a 2\u20130 Argentina win; therefore Argentina passed to the next round being the first in the group.\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=My daughter Daniela could not be called by her last name.

The hot-tempered game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Argentina. Next, Argentina moved on to the quarter-finals, playing England at the [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]]. The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup. Colombia, with great players such as [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]] not only won the qualifiers unbeaten, but sent Argentina to play against the representative of [[Oceania]] to get a place for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/0000/00/00/C-995-colombia-93.php \"Colombia 93\"], ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]''</ref>\n\nThe most important sports magazine of Argentina, ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]'', went into \"mourning\" with a completely black cover with the only legend: \"''Verg\u00fcenza''\" (\"Shame\") that expressed the deception and humiliation after the defeat.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/edicion_impresa.php?fh=1&tipo_edicion=1#anchorTapa ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' #3857, 7 September 1993]</ref><ref>[http://damepelota.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/15-argentina0-colombia5/ \"A 15 a\u00f1os de Argentina 0-Colombia 5\" by Pablo Lisotto], 5 September 2008</ref>\n\nArgentina had to play two knockout games against Australia to earn a place at the World Cup. Basile asked Maradona to return to the national squad so the team needed him to qualify to the Cup. Maradona agreed and he flew to [[Sydney]] with the rest of the team.<ref>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/671999-Basile-le-pedia-al-10-volver-a-la-Seleccion-para-clasificar-al-Mundial-94.html \"Basile le ped\u00eda al '10' volver a la Selecci\u00f3n\", PlayFutbol], 23 September 2012</ref> Argentina played the first game on 31 October 1993 which ended 1\u20131. The second match was in Buenos Aires, where the national team won 1\u20130 (Batistuta) qualifying for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-168711-2011-05-24.html \"Un caf\u00e9 veloz y a la Justicia\"], ''[[P\u00e1gina/12]]'', 24 May 2011</ref>\n\n===Another hard time: USA '94===\nArgentina played several friendly matches as preparation for the World Cup. The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909.

The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament. It was the third South American title for the Argentina national team.\n\n===1928 Summer Olympics===\n{{Main|Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Argentina Olympic football team}}\n[[File:Argentina football team Olympics 1928.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The team that reached the final of the 1928 Summer Olympics.]]\n\nIn 1928, Argentina went to Amsterdam to play the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], which was the first international tournament played by the national team in its history. The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field. Argentina was trashed [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] (8\u20132), [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), Uruguay (4\u20130), Chile (6\u20132) and Brazil (3\u20130). The team was defeated by Peru in the last game but won the tournament due to finishing first in its group. The attacking line, formed by [[Oreste Corbatta]], [[Humberto Maschio]], [[Antonio Valent\u00edn Angelillo|Antonio Angelillo]], [[Omar S\u00edvori]] and [[Osvaldo H\u00e9ctor Cruz|Osvaldo Cruz]], was widely praised by then, being still remembered by the media and football fans.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm \"Los Carasucias: la gloria cumple 50 a\u00f1os\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014055858/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm |date=2013-10-14 }}, ''Clar\u00edn'', 3 April 2007</ref> Maschio was also the topscorer with 9 goals.\n\nArgentina returned to a World Cup competition after 24 years, more precisely to the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] held in Sweden. The team suffered the absence of Maschio, Angelillo and S\u00edvori (playing in the [[Serie A|Italian first division]] but not called by St\u00e1bile for the tournament<ref>[http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html \"El Bocha Maschio y la generaci\u00f3n perdida\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002451/http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Misi\u00f3n Mundial'', 4 May 2010</ref>), who had made outstanding performances in Lima one year before. Although the squad was formed with valued players, the lack of experience facing European squads was evidenced once the tournament finished. Argentina lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3\u20131 in the first game, though they came back to defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the second match. Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England.

Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave.

The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.

Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history. Nevertheless, other journalists assert that there were too many offensive midfielders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%C2%B478/ |title=\"Maradona y el Mundial 78\" |access-date=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022131351/http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%c2%b478/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passarella world cup.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team captain [[Daniel Passarella]] holding the World Cup trophy.]]\nArgentina finally debuted on 2 June 1978 against Hungary, winning 2\u20131.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post. Despite the poor performances, the national team achieved two world titles (senior and youth) during the nine years with Menotti as coach.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v.

Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw.

The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

The national team played some friendly matches and tournaments such as the Stanley Rous Cup, where Argentina drew 2\u20132 with England at Wembley Stadium (after losing 0\u20132 after the first half).

Argentina won the tournament unbeaten, winning six of seven matches. [[Gabriel Batistuta]] was also the leading scorer of the Copa with six goals. Apart from Batistuta, Sergio Goycochea, [[Leonardo Astrada]], Claudio Caniggia, [[Diego Simeone]] (who wore the number 10 kit shirt), [[Dario Franco]], [[Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez|Leo Rodr\u00edguez]] were some of the most notable Argentine players.<ref name=recambio/>\n\nIn 1992, Argentina won the friendly tournament [[Kirin Cup]] (defeating [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]).

The team shared group with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Argentina won the first two as visitor to Peru (1\u20130 in Lima) and Paraguay (3\u20131 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]) but lost to Colombia 2\u20131 in [[Barranquilla]]. In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup.

The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

And their husbands have more right to take them back in this [period] if they want reconciliation. And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n:\u2014 2:228</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Divorce is twice. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah\u2014it is those who are the wrongdoers.\n:\u2014 2:229</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them\u2014and settlement is best. And present in [human] souls is stinginess. But if you do good and fear Allah\u2014then indeed Allah is ever Acquainted, with what you do.\n:\u2014 4:128</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women\u2014if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated. And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth. And whoever fears Allah\u2014He will make for him of his matter ease.\n:\u2014 65:4</blockquote>\n\n===Hadith===\nThe most well known story that references khul' and serves as the basis for legal interpretations is the story of Jamilah, the wife of [[Thabit ibn Qays]]:<ref>Macfarlane, 2012, p. 34</ref>\n\nNarrated Ibn 'Abbas: The wife of Thabit bin Qais came to the Prophet and said, \"O Allah's Apostle! I do not blame Thabit for defects in his character or his religion, but I, being a Muslim, dislike to behave in un-Islamic manner if I remain with him.\" On that Allah's Apostle said to her, \"Will you give back the garden which your husband has given you as Mahr?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Then the Prophet ordered to Thabit, \"O Thabit! Accept your garden, and divorce her once.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=63&translator=1&start=0&number=197|title=63. Divorce - Sahih Al-Bukhari - 0 - 197|last=SearchTruth|website=SearchTruth.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Related issues==\n===Compensation===\nMost Islamic schools of law agree that the husband is not entitled to more than the initial amount of dower ([[mahr]]) given to the wife.  However, some interpretations suggest that the husband is entitled a greater compensation, while other interpretations suggest that the husband is not entitled to any compensation.<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref>  According to some interpretations, khul\u02bf demands that the mahr already paid be returned along with any wedding gifts.  Many imams interpret this law only to apply if there is no fault on the husband. Men sometimes prefer and pressure their wives to demand a khul\u02bf instead of the husband pronouncing a talaq so that the husband can demand the return of the mahr. Another scenario that rarely arises in khul\u02bf is that the husband will request an unreasonable financial compensation. This can effectively constrain her from seeking khul\u02bf because they have no means to support themselves financially with the loss of their mahr and other wedding \u201cgifts.\u201d<ref>Macfarlane,2012, 195-6.</ref>\n\n===Consent of the husband===\nIn regard to the consent of the husband, most schools{{which|date=December 2016}} agree that husband's agreement is a basic procedure and essential to the granting of divorce, unless extenuating circumstances apply.  While this is the prevailing interpretation, other interpretations suggest that the husband does not have to consent if the grounds of divorce are valid, such as cruelty (''darar'') or impotence (if undisclosed to bride at time of marriage).  In addition, if a husband cannot provide his wife with basic marital obligations, such as shelter or maintenance, a woman may be granted khul\u02bf.<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref>  If the woman is underage, then consent must be given from the guardian of her property.<ref>Nasir, 2009, p. 131</ref>  In almost all cases, a woman must have clear evidence in her favour to be granted khul\u02bf<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref> The laws of khul\u02bf in particular cannot be found in the Qur'an directly, so a [[Sharia]] court judge must discern from Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence historical cases what they believe to be valid reasons for divorce.<ref>Macfarlane, 2012, p. 168-9.</ref>\n\n===Role of the Court===\nViews on role of the court and judge varies across schools, depending on whether or not the divorce is considered a type of [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]] (husband's repudiation of the marriage) or judicial annulment.  If the husband does not consent to the divorce, a woman often goes to a mediating third party, such as an imam.  Only a person versed in Islamic law i.e. a [[qadi]], or Islamic Sharia court judge, can grant the khul\u02bf without the husband's consent. When petition for khul\u02bf is taken to the Sharia courts, a judge is permitted to substitute the husband and annul the marriage.  This process of judicial annulment is also commonly referred to as ''faskh'', which typically occurs when the husband refuses to consent to the wife's decision to divorce.<ref>Tucker 2008, p.97-99</ref>\n\n===Iddah===\nWhen a woman is granted a divorce through khul\u02bf, she must enter a waiting period known as [[iddah]].  During this period, a woman is not allowed to remarry for  one  menstrual cycle {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}to ensure that she is not pregnant. In case of divorce women has to wait for three menstrual cycles. Most jurists  recommend  waiting  for the  three  menstrual cycles even for the [[iddah]] of a divorce through khul\u02bf.   If a woman has already gone through menopause, she must wait three calendar months.  The waiting period for a woman who has irregular periods is dependent on different interpretations.  While some jurists believe that a woman should observe the waiting period for three calendar months as well, others {{which|date=December 2016}}believe that a woman should observe the waiting period for nine months{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.  If a woman is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the waiting period, she must observe the waiting period until laying her burden.<ref>Tucker 2008, p. 100-101.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5163/does-iddah-apply-in-the-case-of-khula|title=Does \u2018iddah apply in the case of khula\u2019? - Islam Question & Answer|website=islamqa.info|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n===Custody===\nCustody over children tends to favor the mother if she has not remarried, but the father is still expected to provide childcare, unless the wife is able to take on the expenses herself.  Once a child is old enough, he or she is given the choice to decide who has custody.<ref>Welchman, 1998, p. 121</ref>\n\n==Interpretations by region==\n===Egypt===\nA form of khul\u02bf was adopted by [[Egypt]] in 2000, allowing a Muslim woman to divorce her husband. As a condition of the divorce, the woman renounces any financial claim on the husband and any entitlement to the matrimonial home.<ref>[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/14/177086.html \"Egypt Divorce Rates Hit New High with 'Khula' Law\"]. Al Arabiya News. December 4, 2012.</ref> In Egypt, it is very difficult for a woman to be granted khul\u02bf. In the first two years after khul\u02bf was adopted 5,000 cases were brought before Egyptian courts. Of the 5,000 cases, only 122 were approved. Although difficult to obtain, many believe that the implementation of khul\u02bf in Egypt is a milestone for Islamic activists.<ref>Hamada 2010, The Hard Way Out, Divorce By Khula.</ref> The Islamic khul\u02bf procedure has also been used by some Egyptian Christian women to obtain a no-fault divorce, and it is considered by some as an opportunity for their empowerment vis-\u00e0-vis patriarchical institutions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X5GAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|page=154|title=Human Rights under State-Enforced Religious Family Laws in Israel, Egypt and India|author=Y\u00fcksel Sezgin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Iraq===\nIraq is unique in that it is stated in the law that infidelity constitutes as a valid reason for divorce.  In addition, a woman is allowed to seek khul\u02bf if her husband is infertile and they do not have children.<ref>Welchman 1998, p. 109.</ref>  When a woman is granted khul\u02bf, compensation can be greater or less than the dower.<ref>Nasir 2009, p. 131</ref>\n\n===Jordan, Morocco, and Syria===\nIn Morocco, if a woman is coerced or harassed by her husband, the husband has no entitlement to compensation.  In [[Morocco]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]], compensation other than money can include child care or custody.  In Jordan, a new law has been recently passed that allows a woman to end her marriage by using the principle of khul\u02bf itself.  Within the first two years of passing this law, the courts saw an exponential increase in khul\u02bf lawsuits.  The law has yet to be approved by parliament, however, and it is still condemned by many lawyers to this day.<ref>Nasir 2009, pp. 131\u2013134</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\nKhul\u02bf is the most common form of divorce in Northern [[Nigeria]].  If a woman can provide enough compensation on her own or with the help of family, it is likely that she will be able to get out of an unhappy marriage.<ref>Nasir 2009, p. 130.</ref>\n\n===North America===\nAccording to a ten-year study from 1992 to 2002 conducted by Dr Ilyas Ba-Yunus, the overall divorce rate amongst Muslims in North America was at 32% which was significantly lower than the 51% rate for the general population.<ref>Macfarlane 2012, Islamic Divorce in North America, 142.</ref> Further, In North America, a 2009 a study conducted for SoundVision, an Islamic foundation, concluded that 64% of Islamic divorces are initiated by women.<ref>Macfarlane, 167.</ref> Imams in North America have adopted multiple approaches towards Khul\u02bf. One of the biggest issues that cause imams to differ in their views is whether or not the women should return the mahr to the husband. Another important issue for women in North America is getting both a civil decree and religious divorce. Religious divorce is sought out as \"a meaningful personal and spiritual process\" that is attained in addition to (not as a substitute) to a civil decree. Another important issue that arises in North America is that many women are unaware of their Islamic right to seek khul\u02bf. Some North American women even caution that being assertive and knowledgeable of Islamic law in front of their imam may even be detrimental to them. Women have said that the imams appeared to be \"less sympathetic\" because they saw the women as challengers to their authority.<ref>Macfarlane, 175\u2013176.</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\nAccording to the \"Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act\" passed in 1939, judicial Khula was allowed to be authorized without the husband's consent if the wife was agreed to forfeit her financial rights.<ref>Barrister Tasheen Butt and Associates, Laws of Pakistan Relating to Marriage, Divorce, Custody and Maintenance</ref> Marriage is not considered a sacrament among Muslims but rather a civil contract with \"spiritual and moral\" undertones. Therefore, legally, the marriage can be dissolved for \"good cause.\" The wife has the right to have the marriage dissolved on the grounds of Khula if she decides she cannot live with her husband. In [[Pakistan]] there are two different classes of Khula. The first (i) is by mutual agreement; and the (ii) By order of the court [[Qadi]] and dissolution of marriage taking place by the husband's pronouncing talaq in the first class of cases and by the order of the [[Qadi]] or the court in the second class of cases. The [[Qur'an]] declares \u201cWomen have rights against men similar to those them.\"'<ref>Kakhakel 2008, The Law of Divorce in Pakistan</ref> The wife alone wishes to divorce her husband; and there are two ways for her to achieve this divorce or 'khula' (i) She requests her husband that she no longer wishes to remain in marriage with him; and the husband declares a divorce upon her. (ii) If her husband is not willing to grant her a divorce, the wife is well within her rights in [[Shariah]] to approach a Shariah Court and present her divorce case to the Shariah Judge. The Judge would then summon the husband and ask him to declare a divorce upon his wife and free her from the marriage. If the husband for any reason refuses, the [[Sharia]] Judge has the right to declare a divorce between the husband and the wife in marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfanlaw.com/|title=Law Firm {{!}} Karachi {{!}} Pakistan {{!}} Lawyers {{!}} Corporate, Trademark Law, Litigation, Property|website=Law Firm {{!}} Karachi {{!}} Pakistan {{!}} Lawyers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nWomen awarded khul\u02bf in [[Saudi Arabia]] are required to financially compensate their husbands or give away marriage settlements. Sometimes, this may include custody rights to their children. Other than the dowry, it is also common for the wife, especially in the case of newlyweds, to return marriage expenses. Older females in Saudi Arabia generally do not support khul\u02bf. They believe that the increased number of khul\u02bf requests is the result of Western influences of Saudi culture. Mainly, the new belief that women should also pursue financial aspirations. In Saudi Arabia, women can end up losing when awarded khul\u02bf. This is because often they cannot support themselves or their children.<ref>Hamada, 2010, ''The Hard Way Out: Divorce by Khula''</ref>\n\n===Yemen===\nIn Yemen, khul\u02bf is recognized as a judicially supervised annulment.  Alcoholism, jail time of more than three years, impotence, mental feebleness, and hatred constitute as valid reasons for a woman to seek khul\u02bf.  While domestic violence is not always constituted as valid, it is against the law in Yemen for husbands to physically or psychologically harm their wives.<ref>Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel 2009, p. 175.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel (2009).

Accept your garden, and divorce her once.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=63&translator=1&start=0&number=197|title=63. Divorce - Sahih Al-Bukhari - 0 - 197|last=SearchTruth|website=SearchTruth.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Related issues==\n===Compensation===\nMost Islamic schools of law agree that the husband is not entitled to more than the initial amount of dower ([[mahr]]) given to the wife.  However, some interpretations suggest that the husband is entitled a greater compensation, while other interpretations suggest that the husband is not entitled to any compensation.<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref>  According to some interpretations, khul\u02bf demands that the mahr already paid be returned along with any wedding gifts.  Many imams interpret this law only to apply if there is no fault on the husband. Men sometimes prefer and pressure their wives to demand a khul\u02bf instead of the husband pronouncing a talaq so that the husband can demand the return of the mahr. Another scenario that rarely arises in khul\u02bf is that the husband will request an unreasonable financial compensation. This can effectively constrain her from seeking khul\u02bf because they have no means to support themselves financially with the loss of their mahr and other wedding \u201cgifts.\u201d<ref>Macfarlane,2012, 195-6.</ref>\n\n===Consent of the husband===\nIn regard to the consent of the husband, most schools{{which|date=December 2016}} agree that husband's agreement is a basic procedure and essential to the granting of divorce, unless extenuating circumstances apply.  While this is the prevailing interpretation, other interpretations suggest that the husband does not have to consent if the grounds of divorce are valid, such as cruelty (''darar'') or impotence (if undisclosed to bride at time of marriage).  In addition, if a husband cannot provide his wife with basic marital obligations, such as shelter or maintenance, a woman may be granted khul\u02bf.<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref>  If the woman is underage, then consent must be given from the guardian of her property.<ref>Nasir, 2009, p. 131</ref>  In almost all cases, a woman must have clear evidence in her favour to be granted khul\u02bf<ref>Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138</ref> The laws of khul\u02bf in particular cannot be found in the Qur'an directly, so a [[Sharia]] court judge must discern from Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence historical cases what they believe to be valid reasons for divorce.<ref>Macfarlane, 2012, p. 168-9.</ref>\n\n===Role of the Court===\nViews on role of the court and judge varies across schools, depending on whether or not the divorce is considered a type of [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]] (husband's repudiation of the marriage) or judicial annulment.  If the husband does not consent to the divorce, a woman often goes to a mediating third party, such as an imam.  Only a person versed in Islamic law i.e. a [[qadi]], or Islamic Sharia court judge, can grant the khul\u02bf without the husband's consent. When petition for khul\u02bf is taken to the Sharia courts, a judge is permitted to substitute the husband and annul the marriage.  This process of judicial annulment is also commonly referred to as ''faskh'', which typically occurs when the husband refuses to consent to the wife's decision to divorce.<ref>Tucker 2008, p.97-99</ref>\n\n===Iddah===\nWhen a woman is granted a divorce through khul\u02bf, she must enter a waiting period known as [[iddah]].  During this period, a woman is not allowed to remarry for  one  menstrual cycle {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}to ensure that she is not pregnant. In case of divorce women has to wait for three menstrual cycles. Most jurists  recommend  waiting  for the  three  menstrual cycles even for the [[iddah]] of a divorce through khul\u02bf.   If a woman has already gone through menopause, she must wait three calendar months.  The waiting period for a woman who has irregular periods is dependent on different interpretations.  While some jurists believe that a woman should observe the waiting period for three calendar months as well, others {{which|date=December 2016}}believe that a woman should observe the waiting period for nine months{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.  If a woman is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the waiting period, she must observe the waiting period until laying her burden.<ref>Tucker 2008, p. 100-101.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5163/does-iddah-apply-in-the-case-of-khula|title=Does \u2018iddah apply in the case of khula\u2019? - Islam Question & Answer|website=islamqa.info|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n===Custody===\nCustody over children tends to favor the mother if she has not remarried, but the father is still expected to provide childcare, unless the wife is able to take on the expenses herself.  Once a child is old enough, he or she is given the choice to decide who has custody.<ref>Welchman, 1998, p. 121</ref>\n\n==Interpretations by region==\n===Egypt===\nA form of khul\u02bf was adopted by [[Egypt]] in 2000, allowing a Muslim woman to divorce her husband. As a condition of the divorce, the woman renounces any financial claim on the husband and any entitlement to the matrimonial home.<ref>[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/14/177086.html \"Egypt Divorce Rates Hit New High with 'Khula' Law\"]. Al Arabiya News. December 4, 2012.</ref> In Egypt, it is very difficult for a woman to be granted khul\u02bf. In the first two years after khul\u02bf was adopted 5,000 cases were brought before Egyptian courts. Of the 5,000 cases, only 122 were approved. Although difficult to obtain, many believe that the implementation of khul\u02bf in Egypt is a milestone for Islamic activists.<ref>Hamada 2010, The Hard Way Out, Divorce By Khula.</ref> The Islamic khul\u02bf procedure has also been used by some Egyptian Christian women to obtain a no-fault divorce, and it is considered by some as an opportunity for their empowerment vis-\u00e0-vis patriarchical institutions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X5GAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|page=154|title=Human Rights under State-Enforced Religious Family Laws in Israel, Egypt and India|author=Y\u00fcksel Sezgin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Iraq===\nIraq is unique in that it is stated in the law that infidelity constitutes as a valid reason for divorce.  In addition, a woman is allowed to seek khul\u02bf if her husband is infertile and they do not have children.<ref>Welchman 1998, p. 109.</ref>  When a woman is granted khul\u02bf, compensation can be greater or less than the dower.<ref>Nasir 2009, p. 131</ref>\n\n===Jordan, Morocco, and Syria===\nIn Morocco, if a woman is coerced or harassed by her husband, the husband has no entitlement to compensation.  In [[Morocco]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]], compensation other than money can include child care or custody.  In Jordan, a new law has been recently passed that allows a woman to end her marriage by using the principle of khul\u02bf itself.  Within the first two years of passing this law, the courts saw an exponential increase in khul\u02bf lawsuits.  The law has yet to be approved by parliament, however, and it is still condemned by many lawyers to this day.<ref>Nasir 2009, pp. 131\u2013134</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\nKhul\u02bf is the most common form of divorce in Northern [[Nigeria]].  If a woman can provide enough compensation on her own or with the help of family, it is likely that she will be able to get out of an unhappy marriage.<ref>Nasir 2009, p. 130.</ref>\n\n===North America===\nAccording to a ten-year study from 1992 to 2002 conducted by Dr Ilyas Ba-Yunus, the overall divorce rate amongst Muslims in North America was at 32% which was significantly lower than the 51% rate for the general population.<ref>Macfarlane 2012, Islamic Divorce in North America, 142.</ref> Further, In North America, a 2009 a study conducted for SoundVision, an Islamic foundation, concluded that 64% of Islamic divorces are initiated by women.<ref>Macfarlane, 167.</ref> Imams in North America have adopted multiple approaches towards Khul\u02bf. One of the biggest issues that cause imams to differ in their views is whether or not the women should return the mahr to the husband. Another important issue for women in North America is getting both a civil decree and religious divorce. Religious divorce is sought out as \"a meaningful personal and spiritual process\" that is attained in addition to (not as a substitute) to a civil decree. Another important issue that arises in North America is that many women are unaware of their Islamic right to seek khul\u02bf. Some North American women even caution that being assertive and knowledgeable of Islamic law in front of their imam may even be detrimental to them. Women have said that the imams appeared to be \"less sympathetic\" because they saw the women as challengers to their authority.<ref>Macfarlane, 175\u2013176.</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\nAccording to the \"Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act\" passed in 1939, judicial Khula was allowed to be authorized without the husband's consent if the wife was agreed to forfeit her financial rights.<ref>Barrister Tasheen Butt and Associates, Laws of Pakistan Relating to Marriage, Divorce, Custody and Maintenance</ref> Marriage is not considered a sacrament among Muslims but rather a civil contract with \"spiritual and moral\" undertones. Therefore, legally, the marriage can be dissolved for \"good cause.\" The wife has the right to have the marriage dissolved on the grounds of Khula if she decides she cannot live with her husband. In [[Pakistan]] there are two different classes of Khula. The first (i) is by mutual agreement; and the (ii) By order of the court [[Qadi]] and dissolution of marriage taking place by the husband's pronouncing talaq in the first class of cases and by the order of the [[Qadi]] or the court in the second class of cases. The [[Qur'an]] declares \u201cWomen have rights against men similar to those them.\"'<ref>Kakhakel 2008, The Law of Divorce in Pakistan</ref> The wife alone wishes to divorce her husband; and there are two ways for her to achieve this divorce or 'khula' (i) She requests her husband that she no longer wishes to remain in marriage with him; and the husband declares a divorce upon her. (ii) If her husband is not willing to grant her a divorce, the wife is well within her rights in [[Shariah]] to approach a Shariah Court and present her divorce case to the Shariah Judge. The Judge would then summon the husband and ask him to declare a divorce upon his wife and free her from the marriage. If the husband for any reason refuses, the [[Sharia]] Judge has the right to declare a divorce between the husband and the wife in marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfanlaw.com/|title=Law Firm {{!}} Karachi {{!}} Pakistan {{!}} Lawyers {{!}} Corporate, Trademark Law, Litigation, Property|website=Law Firm {{!}} Karachi {{!}} Pakistan {{!}} Lawyers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nWomen awarded khul\u02bf in [[Saudi Arabia]] are required to financially compensate their husbands or give away marriage settlements. Sometimes, this may include custody rights to their children. Other than the dowry, it is also common for the wife, especially in the case of newlyweds, to return marriage expenses. Older females in Saudi Arabia generally do not support khul\u02bf. They believe that the increased number of khul\u02bf requests is the result of Western influences of Saudi culture. Mainly, the new belief that women should also pursue financial aspirations. In Saudi Arabia, women can end up losing when awarded khul\u02bf. This is because often they cannot support themselves or their children.<ref>Hamada, 2010, ''The Hard Way Out: Divorce by Khula''</ref>\n\n===Yemen===\nIn Yemen, khul\u02bf is recognized as a judicially supervised annulment.  Alcoholism, jail time of more than three years, impotence, mental feebleness, and hatred constitute as valid reasons for a woman to seek khul\u02bf.  While domestic violence is not always constituted as valid, it is against the law in Yemen for husbands to physically or psychologically harm their wives.<ref>Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel 2009, p. 175.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel (2009).
