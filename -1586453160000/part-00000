The Safety Harbor culture area was divided into [[chiefdoms]]. One documented chiefdom in what is now Pinellas County was that of the [[Tocobaga]], who occupied a town and large temple mound, the [[Safety Harbor Site]], overlooking the bay in what is now [[Safety Harbor, FL|Safety Harbor]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|year=1995|isbn=0-8130-1636-3|location=Gainesville, Florida|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> The modern site is protected and can be visited as part of the County's [[Philippe Park]].\n\n===Spanish and British Florida===\nDuring the early 16th century [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]] discovered and slowly began exploring Florida, including Tampa Bay. In 1528 [[Panfilo de Narvaez]] [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition#Arrival in Florida|landed in Pinellas]], and 10 years later [[Hernando de Soto]] is [[Hernando DeSoto#De Soto's exploration of North America|thought]] to have explored the [[Tampa Bay Area]]. By the early 18th century the Tocobaga had been virtually annihilated, having fallen victim to [[Smallpox|European diseases]] from which they had no immunity, as well as [[Queen Anne's War|European conflicts]]. Later Spanish explorers named the area ''Punta Pi\u00f1al'' ([[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] for \"Point of Pines\" or \"Piney Point\"). After trading hands [[History of Florida#Colonialism: Battleground for Europe|multiple times]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], Spain finally [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|ceded Florida]] to the United States in 1821, and in 1823 the U.S. Army established [[Fort Brooke]] (later [[Tampa, FL|Tampa]]).\n\n===Settlement of West Hillsborough===\nIn 1834 much of west central Florida, including the Pinellas peninsula (then known simply as ''West Hillsborough''), was organized as [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/en/about-hillsborough/history/hillsborough-county-history |title=Hillsborough County History |website=Hillsborough County Official Website }}</ref> The very next year [[Odet Philippe]] became the first permanent, non-native resident of the peninsula when he established a homestead near the site of the Tocobaga village in Safety Harbor. It was Philippe who first introduced both [[citrus]] culture and [[cigar]]-making to Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=13637|title=Odet Philippe Marker|work=hmdb.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/11_philippe.htm|title=Pinellas County, Florida, Park and Conservation Resources - Philippe Park|work=pinellascounty.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genforum.genealogy.com/philippe/messages/112.html|title=ODET PHILIPPE - FLORIDA PIONEE - Genealogy.com|work=genealogy.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after [[William Henry Harrison]], as a rest post for soldiers from nearby Fort Brooke during the [[Second Seminole War]]. The new fort was located on a bluff overlooking [[Clearwater, Florida|Clear Water Harbor]], which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development (now historic district) called [[Harbor Oaks Residential District|Harbor Oaks]]. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1977 after Alfred C. Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while digging a swimming pool on his estate. Clearwater would later become the first organized community on the peninsula as well as the site of its first post office.\n\nThe [[Armed Occupation Act]], passed in 1842, encouraged further settlement of Pinellas, like all of Florida, by offering 160 acres (0.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Pioneer families like the Booths, the Coachmans, the Marstons, and the McMullens established homesteads in the area in the years following, planting more citrus groves and raising cattle. During the [[American Civil War]], many residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. Brothers James and Daniel McMullen <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fl-genweb.org/decole/Polk/genealogy/7Brothers.html|title=7Brothers|work=fl-genweb.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> were members of the Confederate [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|Cow Cavalry]], driving Florida cattle to Georgia and the Carolinas to help sustain the war effort. John W. Marston served in the 9th Florida Regiment as a part of the Appomattox Campaign. Many other residents served in other capacities. Otherwise the peninsula had virtually no significance during the war, and the war largely passed the area by.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ussforthenry.com/USSFHpdf/Pinellas_Whitehurst.PDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226192309/http://www.ussforthenry.com/USSFHpdf/Pinellas_Whitehurst.PDF |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] became West Hillsborough's first incorporated city in 1887, and in 1888 the [[Orange Belt Railway]] was extended into the southern portion of the peninsula. Railroad owner [[Peter Demens]] named the town that grew near the railroad's terminus [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] in honor of his [[St. Petersburg, Russia|hometown]]. The town would incorporate in 1892. Other major towns in the county incorporated during this time were Clearwater (1891), [[Dunedin, FL|Dunedin]] (1899), and [[Largo, Florida|Largo]] (1905).\n\nConstruction of [[Fort De Soto]], on Mullet Key facing the mouth of Tampa Bay, was begun in 1898 during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] to protect Tampa Bay from potential invading forces. The fort, a subpost of [[Fort Dade]] on adjacent [[Egmont Key]] (which lies in the mouth of Tampa Bay), was equipped with artillery and mortar batteries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortdesoto.com/twelveinchmortars.php|title=Twelve-inch mortars|work=fortdesoto.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Birth of Pinellas County===\nEven into the early years of the 20th century, West Hillsborough had no paved roads, and transportation posed a major challenge. A trip to the county seat, across the bay in Tampa, was generally an overnight affair and the automobiles that existed on the peninsula at that time would frequently become bogged down in the muck after rainstorms. Angry at what was perceived as neglect by the county government, residents of Pinellas began a push to secede from Hillsborough. They succeeded, and on January 1, 1912 Pinellas County came into being.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/pinellas-county-turns-100-years-old/1208294|title=Pinellas County turns 100 years old|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=November 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924132337/http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/pinellas-county-turns-100-years-old/1208294|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/PDF/HEObook.pdf</ref> The peninsula, along with a small [[Oldsmar, FL|part of the mainland]] were incorporated into the new county.\n\n===Land boom and prohibition===\nAviation history was made in St. Petersburg on January 1, 1914 when [[Tony Jannus]] made the world's first scheduled commercial airline flight with the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]] from St. Petersburg to Tampa. The popular open-air St. Petersburg concert venue [[Jannus Live]] (formerly known as \"Jannus Landing\") memorializes the flight.\n\nThe early 1920s saw the beginning of a land boom in much of Florida, including Pinellas. During this period municipalities issued a large number of bonds to keep pace with the needed infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The travel time to Tampa was cut in half\u2014from {{convert|43|to|19|mi}}\u2014by the opening of the [[Gandy Bridge]] in 1924, along the same route Jannus' airline used. It was the longest automobile toll bridge in the world at the time.\n\n[[Prohibition]] was unpopular in the area and the peninsula's countless inlets and islands became havens for [[Rum-running|rumrunners]] bringing in liquor from [[Cuba]]. Others distilled [[moonshine]] in the County's still plentiful woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/04/SouthPinellas/For_Coquina_Key__cycl.shtml|title=Southpinellas: For Coquina Key, cycle of rum, boom and bust|work=sptimes.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Great Depression and World War II===\nAs was the case in much of Florida, the [[Great Depression]] came early to Pinellas with the collapse of the real estate boom in 1926. Local economies came into severe difficulties, and by 1930, St. Petersburg defaulted on its bonds. Only after [[World War II]] would significant growth return to the area. During the war, the area's tourist industry collapsed, but thousands of recruits came to the area when the U.S. military decided to use the area for training. Area hotels became barracks. The [[Vinoy Park Hotel]] was used as an [[U.S. Army|Army]] training school. The area's women and girls participated in the war effort as well. Hundreds of girls from the area's most prominent families formed a group called the Bomb-a-Dears, holding dances, socializing with recruits, and selling war bonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/during-world-war-ii-st-pete-had-its-bomb-a-dears/1197832|title=During World War II, St. Pete had its Bomb-a-Dears|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=November 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151958/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/during-world-war-ii-st-pete-had-its-bomb-a-dears/1197832|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}</ref> After the war many of these same soldiers remembered their wartime experience in Pinellas well, and returned as tourists or residents.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the end of the Second World War, Pinellas would enter another period of rapid growth and development. In 1954 the original span of the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] was opened, replacing earlier ferry service. By 1957 Clearwater was America's fastest growing city.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council was founded by the late [[mayor]] of St. Petersburg, [[Herman Goldner]], who sought without success during the 1960s to consolidate various municipalities and unincorporated areas in south Pinellas County. Each year the council presents its Herman Goldner Award for Regional Leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/mayor-packed-ideas-pipe-tobacco-in-rich-public-life/1121765|title=Andrew Meacham, \"Mayor packed ideas, pipe tobacco in rich public life,\" September 15, 2010|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052841/http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/mayor-packed-ideas-pipe-tobacco-in-rich-public-life/1121765|archivedate=June 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTragedy struck on May 9, 1980, when the southbound span of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge was struck by the freighter [[MV Summit Venture|MV ''Summit Venture'']] during a storm, sending over {{convert|1200|ft}} of the bridge plummeting into Tampa Bay.

The county has maintained a fairly large system of [http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/ parks and preserves] that provide residents and visitors retreat from the city and a glimpse of the peninsula's original state.\n\nGeologically, Pinellas is underlain by a series of [[limestone]] formations, the [[Hawthorn Group|Hawthorne limestone]] and the [[Arcadia Formation|Tampa limestone]]. The limestone is porous and stores a large quantity of water. The Hawthorne formation forms a prominent ridge down the spine of the county, from east of Dunedin, south to the Walsingham area and east towards St. Petersburg.<ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/Plan/comp_plan/04natural/ch-1.pdf</ref>\n\nThe 35 miles of beaches and dunes which make up the county's 11 [[barrier island]]s provide habitat for coastal species, serve as critical storm protection for the inland communities, and form the basis of the area's thriving tourism industry. The islands are dynamic, with wave action building some islands further up, eroding others, and forming entirely new islands over time. Though hurricanes are infrequent on this part of Florida's coast, they have had a major impact on the islands, with the [[Great Gale of 1848|Hurricane of 1848]] forming John's Pass between Madeira Beach and Treasure Island, a [[1921 Tampa Bay hurricane|hurricane in 1921]] creating Hurricane Pass and cleaving Hog Island into Honeymoon and Caladesi Islands, and 1985's [[Hurricane Elena]] sealing Dunedin Pass to join Caladesi with [[Clearwater Beach]].<ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/Plan/comp_plan/05coastal/ch-2.pdf</ref>\n\nBetween the barrier islands and the peninsula are several bodies of water, through which traverses a section of the Gulf [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. From north to south they are: [[St. Joseph Sound]] between the islands and Dunedin, Clearwater Harbor between Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, and Boca Ciega Bay in the southern third of the county. Connecting Clearwater Harbor to Boca Ciega Bay is a thin, approximately {{convert|3.5|mi|adj=on}} stretch of water known as The Narrows, which runs next to the town of Indian Shores.\n\nExtending from northeastern [[Boca Ciega Bay]], Long Bayou separates Seminole from St. Petersburg near Bay Pines. Long Bayou once extended significantly farther up the peninsula until the northern portion was sealed off to create [[Lake Seminole (Pinellas County, Florida)|Lake Seminole]]. Extending further still from Long Bayou, the Cross Bayou Canal traverses the peninsula, crossing Pinellas Park in a northeasterly direction before emptying into Tampa Bay on the northwest side of [[St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport]].\n\n====Barrier islands and passes====\n* [[Anclote Key]]- offshore of [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] and the northernmost point in the county\n* Howard Park- a man-made [[pocket beach]] created in the 1960s\n* [[Three Rooker Bar]]- the most geologically recent of Pinellas' barrier islands\n* [[Honeymoon Island]]\n* ''Hurricane Pass''\n* [[Caladesi Island]]\n* ''Dunedin Pass''- shoaled and closed in the 1980s, linking Caladesi Island and Clearwater Beach\n* [[Clearwater Beach]]\n* ''Clearwater Pass''\n* [[Sand Key, Florida|Sand Key]]- the longest of Pinellas' barrier islands\n* ''John's Pass''\n* [[Treasure Island, Florida|Treasure Island]]\n* ''Blind Pass''\n* Long Key ([[St. Pete Beach, Florida|St. Pete Beach]])\n* ''Pass-a-Grille Channel''\n* [[Shell Key Preserve|Shell Key]]\n* [[Tierra Verde]]- on the bay side of Shell Key, links the mainland to Fort De Soto.

[[Coyotes]], though often associated with the American West, are native-to and can be found in Pinellas. [[White-tailed deer]], [[wild turkeys]], [[bobcats]], [[otters]], and [[alligators]] can be found in the county as well.\n\n[[Sea turtles]] nest on the shores or Pinellas' barrier islands and have been threatened by development. Offshore, [[dolphins]], [[sharks]], and [[manatees]] are numerous as well, while closer inshore [[stingrays]] are a common sight, leading those in-the-know to do the \"stingray shuffle\" (shuffling up the sand to scare nearby stingrays off) when entering gulf waters. Species of fish commonly caught in the waters surrounding the county include [[spotted seatrout]], [[red drum]] or redfish, [[common snook|snook]], [[Florida pompano|pompano]], [[Sheepshead (Archosargus)|sheepshead]], [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel|Spanish mackerel]], [[grouper]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[flounder]], [[King mackerel|kingfish]], and [[tarpon]].\n\n===Invasive species===\nLike much of Florida, Pinellas County is home to several invasive species that propagate easily outside their (and their natural predators') native range. Examples of commonly seen invasives include [[Schinus terebinthifolius|Brazilian pepper]], [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]], [[Casuarina equisetifolia|Australian pine]], [[Melaleuca quinquenervia|melaleuca]]\nand [[Dioscorea bulbifera|air potato]]. These species are considered serious pests, and varying methods have been tried to eradicate them. Examples of invasive animals include the [[wild boar]], which poses significant health and agricultural problems in Florida and can sometimes be found in Pinellas, and the [[monk parakeet]], small flocks of which can sometimes be seen in flight or building nests on electrical poles or telecommunications towers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.com/environment/exotic/exotic_and_invasive_species_index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 27, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201210158/http://www.fpl.com/environment/exotic/exotic_and_invasive_species_index.shtml |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nPinellas gained some national attention as the home of the ''[[Feral rhesus macaque#Tampa Bay|Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay]]'', a non-native, feral [[rhesus macaque]] that had been on the loose for approximately three years in the south of the county. No one was sure where the monkey came from, and a [http://www.facebook.com/MysteryMonkeyOfTampaBay Facebook page] set up for the monkey had over 84,000 [[Like button|likes]] (as of October 2012). The monkey was the subject of a sketch on the March 11, 2010 episode of ''[[the Colbert Report]]''.

Pinellas County's geographic position- lying on a peninsula between [[Tampa Bay]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere and serves to moderate temperatures. The geography of the peninsula also causes some variance in the county's average temperatures. St. Petersburg, further south on the peninsula, tends to have warmer daily average lows (by about 3 degrees) than areas such as Dunedin and Palm Harbor further north, though daily highs are very close. The north of the county also has fewer overall days of rain, but higher total annual precipitation when measured in inches, the county's south being prone to shorter, more frequent thunderstorms especially in the late summer.\n\nFreezing temperatures occur only every 2\u20133 years, with freezing precipitation occurring [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area#Winter|extremely rarely]]. Springs are usually short, mild, and dry, with occasional late-season cold fronts. Summertime weather is very consistent, with highs in the low 90s \u00b0F (around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C), lows in the mid-70s \u00b0F (around 24&nbsp;\u00b0C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of afternoon thundershowers. The area experiences significant rainfall during its summer months (approximately May through October), with nearly two-thirds of annual precipitation falling between the months of June and September. The area is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes, but has not suffered a direct hit [[1921 Tampa Bay hurricane|since 1921]]. Fall, like spring, is usually mild and dry, with the hurricane season extending through November and sometimes affecting the area.\n\nMany portions of south Pinellas, especially near the bay and gulf, have tropical microclimates. Tropical trees such as coconut palms and royal palms and fruit trees like mangoes grow very well in these microclimates.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = St. Petersburg, Florida\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 69.3\n|Feb high F = 70.7\n|Mar high F = 75.2\n|Apr high F = 80\n|May high F = 85.8\n|Jun high F = 89.2\n|Jul high F = 90.2\n|Aug high F = 89.9\n|Sep high F = 88.2\n|Oct high F = 83\n|Nov high F = 76.6\n|Dec high F = 71.1\n|year high F = 80.8\n|Jan low F = 54\n|Feb low F = 55.2\n|Mar low F = 59.7\n|Apr low F = 64.6\n|May low F = 70.8\n|Jun low F = 75.2\n|Jul low F = 76.6\n|Aug low F = 76.8\n|Sep low F = 75.8\n|Oct low F = 70\n|Nov low F = 62.9\n|Dec low F = 56.3\n|year low F = 66.5\n|Jan rain inch = 2.76\n|Feb rain inch = 2.87\n|Mar rain inch = 3.29\n|Apr rain inch = 1.92\n|May rain inch = 2.80\n|Jun rain inch = 6.09\n|Jul rain inch = 6.72\n|Aug rain inch = 8.26\n|Sep rain inch = 7.59\n|Oct rain inch = 2.64\n|Nov rain inch = 2.04\n|Dec rain inch = 2.60\n|year rain inch = 49.58\n|Jan rain days = 6.3\n|Feb rain days = 6.1\n|Mar rain days = 6.1\n|Apr rain days = 4.2\n|May rain days = 5\n|Jun rain days = 10.3\n|Jul rain days = 13.5\n|Aug rain days = 14.2\n|Sep rain days = 12\n|Oct rain days = 5.9\n|Nov rain days = 5\n|Dec rain days = 5.5\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name=NCDC2>{{cite web\n |url        = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/fl/087886.pdf\n |title      = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate = May 16, 2010\n |publisher  = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dunedin, Florida\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 69\n|Feb high F = 72\n|Mar high F = 75\n|Apr high F = 80\n|May high F = 85\n|Jun high F = 89\n|Jul high F = 90\n|Aug high F = 90\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 83\n|Nov high F = 77\n|Dec high F = 71\n|year high F = 80.75\n|Jan low F = 50\n|Feb low F = 53\n|Mar low F = 57\n|Apr low F = 62\n|May low F = 68\n|Jun low F = 73\n|Jul low F = 75\n|Aug low F = 75\n|Sep low F = 72\n|Oct low F = 66\n|Nov low F = 59\n|Dec low F = 53\n|year low F = 63.58\n|Jan rain inch = 2.99\n|Feb rain inch = 3.05\n|Mar rain inch = 3.81\n|Apr rain inch = 2.37\n|May rain inch = 2.02\n|Jun rain inch = 6.69\n|Jul rain inch = 8.09\n|Aug rain inch = 8.32\n|Sep rain inch = 6.99\n|Oct rain inch = 3.31\n|Nov rain inch = 2.15\n|Dec rain inch = 2.95\n|year rain inch = 52.74\n|Jan rain days = 4.3\n|Feb rain days = 3.9\n|Mar rain days = 4.5\n|Apr rain days = 3.4\n|May rain days = 3.6\n|Jun rain days = 9.6\n|Jul rain days = 11\n|Aug rain days = 11.6\n|Sep rain days = 8.3\n|Oct rain days = 4.1\n|Nov rain days = 3.2\n|Dec rain days = 3.6\n|source 1 = Weather Channel<ref>http://www.weather.com/outlook/homeandgarden/home/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USFL0119</ref>\n|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 28265\n|1930= 62149\n|1940= 91852\n|1950= 159249\n|1960= 374665\n|1970= 522329\n|1980= 728531\n|1990= 851659\n|2000= 921482\n|2010= 916542\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=975280\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df= }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/fl190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

by people of the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. The Safety Harbor culture area was divided into [[chiefdoms]]. One documented chiefdom in what is now Pinellas County was that of the [[Tocobaga]], who occupied a town and large temple mound, the [[Safety Harbor Site]], overlooking the bay in what is now [[Safety Harbor, FL|Safety Harbor]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|year=1995|isbn=0-8130-1636-3|location=Gainesville, Florida|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> The modern site is protected and can be visited as part of the County's [[Philippe Park]].\n\n===Spanish and British Florida===\nDuring the early 16th century [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]] discovered and slowly began exploring Florida, including Tampa Bay. In 1528 [[Panfilo de Narvaez]] [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition#Arrival in Florida|landed in Pinellas]], and 10 years later [[Hernando de Soto]] is [[Hernando DeSoto#De Soto's exploration of North America|thought]] to have explored the [[Tampa Bay Area]]. By the early 18th century the Tocobaga had been virtually annihilated, having fallen victim to [[Smallpox|European diseases]] from which they had no immunity, as well as [[Queen Anne's War|European conflicts]]. Later Spanish explorers named the area ''Punta Pi\u00f1al'' ([[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] for \"Point of Pines\" or \"Piney Point\"). After trading hands [[History of Florida#Colonialism: Battleground for Europe|multiple times]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], Spain finally [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|ceded Florida]] to the United States in 1821, and in 1823 the U.S. Army established [[Fort Brooke]] (later [[Tampa, FL|Tampa]]).\n\n===Settlement of West Hillsborough===\nIn 1834 much of west central Florida, including the Pinellas peninsula (then known simply as ''West Hillsborough''), was organized as [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/en/about-hillsborough/history/hillsborough-county-history |title=Hillsborough County History |website=Hillsborough County Official Website }}</ref> The very next year [[Odet Philippe]] became the first permanent, non-native resident of the peninsula when he established a homestead near the site of the Tocobaga village in Safety Harbor. It was Philippe who first introduced both [[citrus]] culture and [[cigar]]-making to Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=13637|title=Odet Philippe Marker|work=hmdb.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/11_philippe.htm|title=Pinellas County, Florida, Park and Conservation Resources - Philippe Park|work=pinellascounty.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genforum.genealogy.com/philippe/messages/112.html|title=ODET PHILIPPE - FLORIDA PIONEE - Genealogy.com|work=genealogy.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after [[William Henry Harrison]], as a rest post for soldiers from nearby Fort Brooke during the [[Second Seminole War]]. The new fort was located on a bluff overlooking [[Clearwater, Florida|Clear Water Harbor]], which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development (now historic district) called [[Harbor Oaks Residential District|Harbor Oaks]]. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1977 after Alfred C. Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while digging a swimming pool on his estate. Clearwater would later become the first organized community on the peninsula as well as the site of its first post office.\n\nThe [[Armed Occupation Act]], passed in 1842, encouraged further settlement of Pinellas, like all of Florida, by offering 160 acres (0.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Pioneer families like the Booths, the Coachmans, the Marstons, and the McMullens established homesteads in the area in the years following, planting more citrus groves and raising cattle. During the [[American Civil War]], many residents fought for the [[Confederate States of America]]. Brothers James and Daniel McMullen <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fl-genweb.org/decole/Polk/genealogy/7Brothers.html|title=7Brothers|work=fl-genweb.org|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> were members of the Confederate [[1st Florida Special Cavalry Battalion|Cow Cavalry]], driving Florida cattle to Georgia and the Carolinas to help sustain the war effort. John W. Marston served in the 9th Florida Regiment as a part of the Appomattox Campaign. Many other residents served in other capacities. Otherwise the peninsula had virtually no significance during the war, and the war largely passed the area by.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ussforthenry.com/USSFHpdf/Pinellas_Whitehurst.PDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226192309/http://www.ussforthenry.com/USSFHpdf/Pinellas_Whitehurst.PDF |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] became West Hillsborough's first incorporated city in 1887, and in 1888 the [[Orange Belt Railway]] was extended into the southern portion of the peninsula. Railroad owner [[Peter Demens]] named the town that grew near the railroad's terminus [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] in honor of his [[St. Petersburg, Russia|hometown]]. The town would incorporate in 1892. Other major towns in the county incorporated during this time were Clearwater (1891), [[Dunedin, FL|Dunedin]] (1899), and [[Largo, Florida|Largo]] (1905).\n\nConstruction of [[Fort De Soto]], on Mullet Key facing the mouth of Tampa Bay, was begun in 1898 during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] to protect Tampa Bay from potential invading forces. The fort, a subpost of [[Fort Dade]] on adjacent [[Egmont Key]] (which lies in the mouth of Tampa Bay), was equipped with artillery and mortar batteries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortdesoto.com/twelveinchmortars.php|title=Twelve-inch mortars|work=fortdesoto.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Birth of Pinellas County===\nEven into the early years of the 20th century, West Hillsborough had no paved roads, and transportation posed a major challenge. A trip to the county seat, across the bay in Tampa, was generally an overnight affair and the automobiles that existed on the peninsula at that time would frequently become bogged down in the muck after rainstorms. Angry at what was perceived as neglect by the county government, residents of Pinellas began a push to secede from Hillsborough. They succeeded, and on January 1, 1912 Pinellas County came into being.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/pinellas-county-turns-100-years-old/1208294|title=Pinellas County turns 100 years old|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=November 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924132337/http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/pinellas-county-turns-100-years-old/1208294|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/PDF/HEObook.pdf</ref> The peninsula, along with a small [[Oldsmar, FL|part of the mainland]] were incorporated into the new county.\n\n===Land boom and prohibition===\nAviation history was made in St. Petersburg on January 1, 1914 when [[Tony Jannus]] made the world's first scheduled commercial airline flight with the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]] from St. Petersburg to Tampa. The popular open-air St. Petersburg concert venue [[Jannus Live]] (formerly known as \"Jannus Landing\") memorializes the flight.\n\nThe early 1920s saw the beginning of a land boom in much of Florida, including Pinellas. During this period municipalities issued a large number of bonds to keep pace with the needed infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The travel time to Tampa was cut in half\u2014from {{convert|43|to|19|mi}}\u2014by the opening of the [[Gandy Bridge]] in 1924, along the same route Jannus' airline used. It was the longest automobile toll bridge in the world at the time.\n\n[[Prohibition]] was unpopular in the area and the peninsula's countless inlets and islands became havens for [[Rum-running|rumrunners]] bringing in liquor from [[Cuba]]. Others distilled [[moonshine]] in the County's still plentiful woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/04/SouthPinellas/For_Coquina_Key__cycl.shtml|title=Southpinellas: For Coquina Key, cycle of rum, boom and bust|work=sptimes.com|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Great Depression and World War II===\nAs was the case in much of Florida, the [[Great Depression]] came early to Pinellas with the collapse of the real estate boom in 1926. Local economies came into severe difficulties, and by 1930, St. Petersburg defaulted on its bonds. Only after [[World War II]] would significant growth return to the area. During the war, the area's tourist industry collapsed, but thousands of recruits came to the area when the U.S. military decided to use the area for training. Area hotels became barracks. The [[Vinoy Park Hotel]] was used as an [[U.S. Army|Army]] training school. The area's women and girls participated in the war effort as well. Hundreds of girls from the area's most prominent families formed a group called the Bomb-a-Dears, holding dances, socializing with recruits, and selling war bonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/during-world-war-ii-st-pete-had-its-bomb-a-dears/1197832|title=During World War II, St. Pete had its Bomb-a-Dears|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=November 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151958/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/during-world-war-ii-st-pete-had-its-bomb-a-dears/1197832|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}</ref> After the war many of these same soldiers remembered their wartime experience in Pinellas well, and returned as tourists or residents.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the end of the Second World War, Pinellas would enter another period of rapid growth and development. In 1954 the original span of the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] was opened, replacing earlier ferry service. By 1957 Clearwater was America's fastest growing city.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council was founded by the late [[mayor]] of St. Petersburg, [[Herman Goldner]], who sought without success during the 1960s to consolidate various municipalities and unincorporated areas in south Pinellas County. Each year the council presents its Herman Goldner Award for Regional Leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/mayor-packed-ideas-pipe-tobacco-in-rich-public-life/1121765|title=Andrew Meacham, \"Mayor packed ideas, pipe tobacco in rich public life,\" September 15, 2010|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052841/http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/mayor-packed-ideas-pipe-tobacco-in-rich-public-life/1121765|archivedate=June 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTragedy struck on May 9, 1980, when the southbound span of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge was struck by the freighter [[MV Summit Venture|MV ''Summit Venture'']] during a storm, sending over {{convert|1200|ft}} of the bridge plummeting into Tampa Bay.

The county has maintained a fairly large system of [http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/ parks and preserves] that provide residents and visitors retreat from the city and a glimpse of the peninsula's original state.\n\nGeologically, Pinellas is underlain by a series of [[limestone]] formations, the [[Hawthorn Group|Hawthorne limestone]] and the [[Arcadia Formation|Tampa limestone]]. The limestone is porous and stores a large quantity of water. The Hawthorne formation forms a prominent ridge down the spine of the county, from east of Dunedin, south to the Walsingham area and east towards St. Petersburg.<ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/Plan/comp_plan/04natural/ch-1.pdf</ref>\n\nThe 35 miles of beaches and dunes which make up the county's 11 [[barrier island]]s provide habitat for coastal species, serve as critical storm protection for the inland communities, and form the basis of the area's thriving tourism industry. The islands are dynamic, with wave action building some islands further up, eroding others, and forming entirely new islands over time. Though hurricanes are infrequent on this part of Florida's coast, they have had a major impact on the islands, with the [[Great Gale of 1848|Hurricane of 1848]] forming John's Pass between Madeira Beach and Treasure Island, a [[1921 Tampa Bay hurricane|hurricane in 1921]] creating Hurricane Pass and cleaving Hog Island into Honeymoon and Caladesi Islands, and 1985's [[Hurricane Elena]] sealing Dunedin Pass to join Caladesi with [[Clearwater Beach]].<ref>http://www.pinellascounty.org/Plan/comp_plan/05coastal/ch-2.pdf</ref>\n\nBetween the barrier islands and the peninsula are several bodies of water, through which traverses a section of the Gulf [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. From north to south they are: [[St. Joseph Sound]] between the islands and Dunedin, Clearwater Harbor between Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, and Boca Ciega Bay in the southern third of the county. Connecting Clearwater Harbor to Boca Ciega Bay is a thin, approximately {{convert|3.5|mi|adj=on}} stretch of water known as The Narrows, which runs next to the town of Indian Shores.\n\nExtending from northeastern [[Boca Ciega Bay]], Long Bayou separates Seminole from St. Petersburg near Bay Pines. Long Bayou once extended significantly farther up the peninsula until the northern portion was sealed off to create [[Lake Seminole (Pinellas County, Florida)|Lake Seminole]]. Extending further still from Long Bayou, the Cross Bayou Canal traverses the peninsula, crossing Pinellas Park in a northeasterly direction before emptying into Tampa Bay on the northwest side of [[St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport]].\n\n====Barrier islands and passes====\n* [[Anclote Key]]- offshore of [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] and the northernmost point in the county\n* Howard Park- a man-made [[pocket beach]] created in the 1960s\n* [[Three Rooker Bar]]- the most geologically recent of Pinellas' barrier islands\n* [[Honeymoon Island]]\n* ''Hurricane Pass''\n* [[Caladesi Island]]\n* ''Dunedin Pass''- shoaled and closed in the 1980s, linking Caladesi Island and Clearwater Beach\n* [[Clearwater Beach]]\n* ''Clearwater Pass''\n* [[Sand Key, Florida|Sand Key]]- the longest of Pinellas' barrier islands\n* ''John's Pass''\n* [[Treasure Island, Florida|Treasure Island]]\n* ''Blind Pass''\n* Long Key ([[St. Pete Beach, Florida|St. Pete Beach]])\n* ''Pass-a-Grille Channel''\n* [[Shell Key Preserve|Shell Key]]\n* [[Tierra Verde]]- on the bay side of Shell Key, links the mainland to Fort De Soto.

Offshore ecosystems include the Tampa Bay [[estuary]] and numerous gulf [[seagrass]] beds. The county also maintains several [[artificial reefs]]\n\n===Animal life===\nNumerous bird species can be sighted in Pinellas, either as permanent residents or during the winter migration, including wading birds like [[great blue herons]], [[egrets]], [[American white ibis|white ibises]] and [[roseate spoonbills]], aquatic birds like [[brown pelican]]s, [[American white pelican|white pelicans]], and [[cormorants]], numerous species of [[shorebirds]], and very-common birds like [[seagulls]] and [[passerines]] like the [[blue jay]], [[mockingbird]], and [[American crow|crow]]. [[Osprey]]s are a commonly seen [[bird-of-prey]], with other birds of prey like [[turkey vultures]], [[red-tailed hawk|red tailed hawks]], [[great horned owls]], [[screech owl]]s, [[barn owls]], and [[bald eagles]], among others, seen as well.\n\n[[Gopher tortoises]] are found in many areas, the burrows they dig making them a [[keystone species]]. [[Coyotes]], though often associated with the American West, are native-to and can be found in Pinellas. [[White-tailed deer]], [[wild turkeys]], [[bobcats]], [[otters]], and [[alligators]] can be found in the county as well.\n\n[[Sea turtles]] nest on the shores or Pinellas' barrier islands and have been threatened by development. Offshore, [[dolphins]], [[sharks]], and [[manatees]] are numerous as well, while closer inshore [[stingrays]] are a common sight, leading those in-the-know to do the \"stingray shuffle\" (shuffling up the sand to scare nearby stingrays off) when entering gulf waters. Species of fish commonly caught in the waters surrounding the county include [[spotted seatrout]], [[red drum]] or redfish, [[common snook|snook]], [[Florida pompano|pompano]], [[Sheepshead (Archosargus)|sheepshead]], [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel|Spanish mackerel]], [[grouper]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[flounder]], [[King mackerel|kingfish]], and [[tarpon]].\n\n===Invasive species===\nLike much of Florida, Pinellas County is home to several invasive species that propagate easily outside their (and their natural predators') native range. Examples of commonly seen invasives include [[Schinus terebinthifolius|Brazilian pepper]], [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]], [[Casuarina equisetifolia|Australian pine]], [[Melaleuca quinquenervia|melaleuca]]\nand [[Dioscorea bulbifera|air potato]]. These species are considered serious pests, and varying methods have been tried to eradicate them. Examples of invasive animals include the [[wild boar]], which poses significant health and agricultural problems in Florida and can sometimes be found in Pinellas, and the [[monk parakeet]], small flocks of which can sometimes be seen in flight or building nests on electrical poles or telecommunications towers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.com/environment/exotic/exotic_and_invasive_species_index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 27, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201210158/http://www.fpl.com/environment/exotic/exotic_and_invasive_species_index.shtml |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nPinellas gained some national attention as the home of the ''[[Feral rhesus macaque#Tampa Bay|Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay]]'', a non-native, feral [[rhesus macaque]] that had been on the loose for approximately three years in the south of the county.

Pinellas County's geographic position- lying on a peninsula between [[Tampa Bay]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere and serves to moderate temperatures. The geography of the peninsula also causes some variance in the county's average temperatures. St. Petersburg, further south on the peninsula, tends to have warmer daily average lows (by about 3 degrees) than areas such as Dunedin and Palm Harbor further north, though daily highs are very close. The north of the county also has fewer overall days of rain, but higher total annual precipitation when measured in inches, the county's south being prone to shorter, more frequent thunderstorms especially in the late summer.\n\nFreezing temperatures occur only every 2\u20133 years, with freezing precipitation occurring [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area#Winter|extremely rarely]]. Springs are usually short, mild, and dry, with occasional late-season cold fronts. Summertime weather is very consistent, with highs in the low 90s \u00b0F (around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C), lows in the mid-70s \u00b0F (around 24&nbsp;\u00b0C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of afternoon thundershowers. The area experiences significant rainfall during its summer months (approximately May through October), with nearly two-thirds of annual precipitation falling between the months of June and September. The area is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes, but has not suffered a direct hit [[1921 Tampa Bay hurricane|since 1921]]. Fall, like spring, is usually mild and dry, with the hurricane season extending through November and sometimes affecting the area.\n\nMany portions of south Pinellas, especially near the bay and gulf, have tropical microclimates. Tropical trees such as coconut palms and royal palms and fruit trees like mangoes grow very well in these microclimates.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = St. Petersburg, Florida\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 69.3\n|Feb high F = 70.7\n|Mar high F = 75.2\n|Apr high F = 80\n|May high F = 85.8\n|Jun high F = 89.2\n|Jul high F = 90.2\n|Aug high F = 89.9\n|Sep high F = 88.2\n|Oct high F = 83\n|Nov high F = 76.6\n|Dec high F = 71.1\n|year high F = 80.8\n|Jan low F = 54\n|Feb low F = 55.2\n|Mar low F = 59.7\n|Apr low F = 64.6\n|May low F = 70.8\n|Jun low F = 75.2\n|Jul low F = 76.6\n|Aug low F = 76.8\n|Sep low F = 75.8\n|Oct low F = 70\n|Nov low F = 62.9\n|Dec low F = 56.3\n|year low F = 66.5\n|Jan rain inch = 2.76\n|Feb rain inch = 2.87\n|Mar rain inch = 3.29\n|Apr rain inch = 1.92\n|May rain inch = 2.80\n|Jun rain inch = 6.09\n|Jul rain inch = 6.72\n|Aug rain inch = 8.26\n|Sep rain inch = 7.59\n|Oct rain inch = 2.64\n|Nov rain inch = 2.04\n|Dec rain inch = 2.60\n|year rain inch = 49.58\n|Jan rain days = 6.3\n|Feb rain days = 6.1\n|Mar rain days = 6.1\n|Apr rain days = 4.2\n|May rain days = 5\n|Jun rain days = 10.3\n|Jul rain days = 13.5\n|Aug rain days = 14.2\n|Sep rain days = 12\n|Oct rain days = 5.9\n|Nov rain days = 5\n|Dec rain days = 5.5\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name=NCDC2>{{cite web\n |url        = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/fl/087886.pdf\n |title      = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate = May 16, 2010\n |publisher  = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dunedin, Florida\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 69\n|Feb high F = 72\n|Mar high F = 75\n|Apr high F = 80\n|May high F = 85\n|Jun high F = 89\n|Jul high F = 90\n|Aug high F = 90\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 83\n|Nov high F = 77\n|Dec high F = 71\n|year high F = 80.75\n|Jan low F = 50\n|Feb low F = 53\n|Mar low F = 57\n|Apr low F = 62\n|May low F = 68\n|Jun low F = 73\n|Jul low F = 75\n|Aug low F = 75\n|Sep low F = 72\n|Oct low F = 66\n|Nov low F = 59\n|Dec low F = 53\n|year low F = 63.58\n|Jan rain inch = 2.99\n|Feb rain inch = 3.05\n|Mar rain inch = 3.81\n|Apr rain inch = 2.37\n|May rain inch = 2.02\n|Jun rain inch = 6.69\n|Jul rain inch = 8.09\n|Aug rain inch = 8.32\n|Sep rain inch = 6.99\n|Oct rain inch = 3.31\n|Nov rain inch = 2.15\n|Dec rain inch = 2.95\n|year rain inch = 52.74\n|Jan rain days = 4.3\n|Feb rain days = 3.9\n|Mar rain days = 4.5\n|Apr rain days = 3.4\n|May rain days = 3.6\n|Jun rain days = 9.6\n|Jul rain days = 11\n|Aug rain days = 11.6\n|Sep rain days = 8.3\n|Oct rain days = 4.1\n|Nov rain days = 3.2\n|Dec rain days = 3.6\n|source 1 = Weather Channel<ref>http://www.weather.com/outlook/homeandgarden/home/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USFL0119</ref>\n|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 28265\n|1930= 62149\n|1940= 91852\n|1950= 159249\n|1960= 374665\n|1970= 522329\n|1980= 728531\n|1990= 851659\n|2000= 921482\n|2010= 916542\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=975280\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df= }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/fl190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Cattle ranching was another major industry. In 1885 the American Medical Society declared the Pinellas peninsula the \"healthiest spot on earth\",<ref>[http://webcoast.com/pinellas.htm ''webcoast.com'']</ref> which helped spur the growth of the tourist industry.\n\n===Economy today===\nAnchored by the urban markets of Clearwater and St. Petersburg, Pinellas has the second largest base of manufacturing employment in Florida.\n\nPinellas has diverse, yet symbiotic, industry clusters, including aviation/aerospace, defense/national security, medical technologies, business and financial services, and information technology.\n\nFortune 500 technology manufacturers [[Jabil Circuit]] and [[Tech Data]] and a Fortune 500 financial company [[Raymond James Financial]] are headquartered in the [[Gateway, Pinellas County, Florida|Gateway area]] in and adjacent to Pinellas.

These are typically termed (single currency) [[basis swap]]s (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M, LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a '''spread''' often quoted in basis points to be added to one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.\n\n===Uses===\nInterest rate swaps are used to hedge against or speculate on changes in interest rates.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also used speculatively by hedge funds or other investors who expect a change in interest rates or the relationships between them. Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase cash bonds, whose value increased as rates fell. Today, investors with a similar view could enter a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap; as rates fall, investors would pay a lower floating rate in exchange for the same fixed rate.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also popular for the [[arbitrage]] opportunities they provide. Varying levels of [[creditworthiness]] means that there is often a positive [[quality spread differential]] that allows both parties to benefit from an interest rate swap.\n\nThe interest rate swap market in USD is closely linked to the [[Eurodollar]] futures market which trades among others at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].\n\n==Valuation and pricing==\n{{further information|Rational pricing#Swaps}}\nIRSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, notional changes (such as those in amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a [[day count convention]] of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).\n\nA vanilla IRS is the term used for standardised IRSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency.<ref name=PTIRDs /> A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' referencing an -IBOR index. The net [[present value]] (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further [[Rational pricing#Valuation at initiation|under Rational pricing]].\n\nCalculating the fixed leg requires discounting all of the known cashflows by an appropriate discount factor:\n\n:<math>P_\\text{fixed} = N  R  \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math>\nwhere <math>N</math> is the notional, <math>R</math> is the fixed rate, <math>n_1</math> is the number of payments, <math>d_i</math> is the decimalised day count fraction of the accrual in the i'th period, and <math>v_i</math> is the discount factor associated with the payment date of the i'th period.\n\nCalculating the floating leg is a similar process replacing the fixed rate with forecast index rates:\n:<math>P_\\text{float} = N \\sum_{j=1}^{n_2} r_j d_j v_j</math>\nwhere <math>n_2</math> is the number of payments of the floating leg and <math>r_j</math> are the forecast -IBOR index rates of the appropriate currency.\n\nThe PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = P_\\text{fixed} - P_\\text{float}</math>\n\nHistorically IRSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the -IBOR rates. This has been called 'self-discounted'. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them.  It became more apparent with the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]] that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] of the IRSs was needed.\n\nPost crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing framework is the '''multi-curve framework''' where forecast -IBOR rates and discount factors exhibit disparity. \nNote that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing|Financial economics \u00a7 Derivative pricing]] for further context. \nHere, [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on [[Credit Support Annex]]es (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. As regards the rates forecast, since  the [[LIBOR\u2013OIS spread|basis spread]] between [[LIBOR]] rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]] used in floating rate derivative legs.<ref>[https://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/multi-curve-valuation-approaches-part-1.pdf Multi-Curve Valuation Approaches and their Application to Hedge Accounting according to IAS 39], Dr. Dirk Schubert, [[KPMG]]</ref> \n\nRegarding the curve build, see \n<ref>M.

[https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3009281 ''FX Forward Invariance & Discounting with CSA Collateral'']</ref>\n\nThe complexities of modern curvesets mean that there may not be discount factors available for a specific -IBOR index curve. These curves are known as 'forecast only' curves and only contain the information of a forecast -IBOR index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve:\n:<math>r_j = \\frac{1}{d_j} \\left ( \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_j} - 1 \\right ) \n</math> where <math>x_{i-1}</math> and <math>x_{i}</math> are the start and end ''discount factors'' associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular -IBOR index in a given currency.\n\nTo price the mid-market or par rate, <math>S</math> of an IRS (defined by the value of fixed rate <math>R</math> that gives a net PV of zero),  the above formula is re-arranged to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_2}r_j d_j v_j}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i}</math>\n\nIn the event old methodologies are applied the discount factors <math>v_k</math> can be replaced with the self discounted values <math>x_k</math> and the above reduces to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{x_0 - x_{n_2}}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i}</math>\n\nIn both cases, the PV of a general swap can be expressed exactly with the following intuitive formula:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = N(R-S)A</math> \nwhere <math>A</math> is the so-called [[Annuity]] factor <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math> (or <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i</math> for self-discounting).  This shows that the PV of an IRS is roughly linear in the swap par rate (though small non-linearities arise from the co-dependency of the swap rate with the discount factors in the Annuity sum). \n\nDuring the life of the swap the same valuation technique is used, but since, over time, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, the PV of the swap will deviate from its initial value. Therefore, the swap will be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. \nThe way these changes in value are reported is the subject of [[IAS 39]] for jurisdictions following [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]], and [[FAS 133]] for [[U.S. GAAP]]. \nSwaps are marked to market by debt security traders to visualize their inventory at a certain time. \nAs regards [[PnL Explained #Sensitivities method|P&L Attribution]], and hedging, the new framework adds complexity in that the trader's position is now potentially affected by numerous instruments not obviously related to the trade in question.\n\n==Risks==\nInterest rate swaps expose users to many different types of financial risk.<ref name=PTIRDs /> \nPredominantly they expose the user to [[market risk]]s and specifically [[interest rate risk]]. \nThe value of an interest rate swap will change as market interest rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as [[Greeks_(finance)#Delta|delta risk]]. \nInterest rate swaps also exhibit [[Greeks_(finance)#Gamma|gamma risk]] whereby their delta risk increases or decreases as market interest rates fluctuate. \n(See [[Greeks (finance)]], [[Value at risk #Computation methods]], [[Value at risk #VaR risk management]]. )\n\nOther specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are [[basis risk]]s - where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another - \nand [[Repricing risk|reset risks]] - where the [[Libor#Calculation|publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes]] are subject to daily fluctuation. \n\nUncollateralised interest rate swaps - those executed bilaterally without a CSA in place - expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and [[credit risk]]s. \nFunding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. \nCredit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps, on the other hand,  expose the users to collateral risks: here, depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. \n\nCredit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. \nRegardless, due to regulations set out in the [[Basel III]] Regulatory Frameworks, trading interest rate derivatives [[regulatory capital|commands a capital usage]]. The consequence of this is that, dependent upon their specific nature, interest rate swaps might command more capital usage, and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users. \n\nGiven these concerns, banks will typically calculate a [[credit valuation adjustment]], as well as other [[XVA|x-valuation adjustment]]s, which then incorporate these risks into the instrument value.\n\nReputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.\n\nHedging interest rate swaps can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks; although, see the discussion above re hedging in a multi-curve environment. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes.\n\n==Quotation and Market-Making==\n=== ISDA Benchmark Swap Rates ===\nISDA, ICAP, and Reuters select a number of swap dealers based on their reputation, credit standing and scale of activity in each major currency. Those dealers are asked to provide swap rates for the designated maturities of a given currency within a polling window. Reuters will calculate the benchmark swap rate based on a simple average of the submitted rates after eliminating the highest and lowest ones and publish them. \n\n===Market-Making===\nThe market-making of IRSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency.<ref name=PTIRDs />\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn June 1988 the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] was tipped off by someone working on the swaps desk of [[Goldman Sachs]] that the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] had a massive exposure to interest rate swaps. When the commission contacted the council, the chief executive told them not to worry as \"everybody knows that interest rates are going to fall\"; the treasurer thought the interest rate swaps were a \"nice little earner\". The Commission's Controller, [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]], realised that the council had put all of its positions on interest rates going down and ordered an investigation.\n\nBy January 1989 the Commission obtained legal opinions from two [[Queen's Counsel]]. Although they did not agree, the commission preferred the opinion that it was ''[[ultra vires]]'' for councils to engage in interest rate swaps (ie. that they had no lawful power to do so). Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the contracts declared void (appeals all the way up to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] failed in ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Audit Commission\">Duncan Campbell-Smith, \"Follow the Money: The Audit Commission, Public Money, and the Management of Public Services 1983-2008\", Allen Lane, 2008, chapter 6 ''passim''.</ref> This resulted in several cases in which the banks generally lost their claims for [[compound interest]] on debts to councils, finalised in ''[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council]]''.<ref>[1996] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html UKHL 12], [1996] AC 669</ref> Banks did, however, recover some funds where the derivatives were \"in the money\" for the Councils (ie, an asset showing a profit for the council, which it now had to return to the bank, not a debt)\n\nThe controversy surrounding interest rate swaps reached a peak in the UK during the financial crisis where banks sold unsuitable interest rate hedging products on a large scale to SMEs.

These are typically termed (single currency) [[basis swap]]s (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M, LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a '''spread''' often quoted in basis points to be added to one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.\n\n===Uses===\nInterest rate swaps are used to hedge against or speculate on changes in interest rates.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also used speculatively by hedge funds or other investors who expect a change in interest rates or the relationships between them. Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase cash bonds, whose value increased as rates fell. Today, investors with a similar view could enter a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap; as rates fall, investors would pay a lower floating rate in exchange for the same fixed rate.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also popular for the [[arbitrage]] opportunities they provide. Varying levels of [[creditworthiness]] means that there is often a positive [[quality spread differential]] that allows both parties to benefit from an interest rate swap.\n\nThe interest rate swap market in USD is closely linked to the [[Eurodollar]] futures market which trades among others at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].\n\n==Valuation and pricing==\n{{further information|Rational pricing#Swaps}}\nIRSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, notional changes (such as those in amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a [[day count convention]] of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).\n\nA vanilla IRS is the term used for standardised IRSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency.<ref name=PTIRDs /> A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' referencing an -IBOR index. The net [[present value]] (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further [[Rational pricing#Valuation at initiation|under Rational pricing]].\n\nCalculating the fixed leg requires discounting all of the known cashflows by an appropriate discount factor:\n\n:<math>P_\\text{fixed} = N  R  \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math>\nwhere <math>N</math> is the notional, <math>R</math> is the fixed rate, <math>n_1</math> is the number of payments, <math>d_i</math> is the decimalised day count fraction of the accrual in the i'th period, and <math>v_i</math> is the discount factor associated with the payment date of the i'th period.\n\nCalculating the floating leg is a similar process replacing the fixed rate with forecast index rates:\n:<math>P_\\text{float} = N \\sum_{j=1}^{n_2} r_j d_j v_j</math>\nwhere <math>n_2</math> is the number of payments of the floating leg and <math>r_j</math> are the forecast -IBOR index rates of the appropriate currency.\n\nThe PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = P_\\text{fixed} - P_\\text{float}</math>\n\nHistorically IRSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the -IBOR rates. This has been called 'self-discounted'. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them.  It became more apparent with the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]] that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] of the IRSs was needed.\n\nPost crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing framework is the '''multi-curve framework''' where forecast -IBOR rates and discount factors exhibit disparity. \nNote that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing|Financial economics \u00a7 Derivative pricing]] for further context. \nHere, [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on [[Credit Support Annex]]es (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. As regards the rates forecast, since  the [[LIBOR\u2013OIS spread|basis spread]] between [[LIBOR]] rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]] used in floating rate derivative legs.<ref>[https://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/multi-curve-valuation-approaches-part-1.pdf Multi-Curve Valuation Approaches and their Application to Hedge Accounting according to IAS 39], Dr. Dirk Schubert, [[KPMG]]</ref> \n\nRegarding the curve build, see \n<ref>M.

[https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3009281 ''FX Forward Invariance & Discounting with CSA Collateral'']</ref>\n\nThe complexities of modern curvesets mean that there may not be discount factors available for a specific -IBOR index curve. These curves are known as 'forecast only' curves and only contain the information of a forecast -IBOR index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve:\n:<math>r_j = \\frac{1}{d_j} \\left ( \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_j} - 1 \\right ) \n</math> where <math>x_{i-1}</math> and <math>x_{i}</math> are the start and end ''discount factors'' associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular -IBOR index in a given currency.\n\nTo price the mid-market or par rate, <math>S</math> of an IRS (defined by the value of fixed rate <math>R</math> that gives a net PV of zero),  the above formula is re-arranged to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_2}r_j d_j v_j}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i}</math>\n\nIn the event old methodologies are applied the discount factors <math>v_k</math> can be replaced with the self discounted values <math>x_k</math> and the above reduces to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{x_0 - x_{n_2}}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i}</math>\n\nIn both cases, the PV of a general swap can be expressed exactly with the following intuitive formula:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = N(R-S)A</math> \nwhere <math>A</math> is the so-called [[Annuity]] factor <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math> (or <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i</math> for self-discounting).  This shows that the PV of an IRS is roughly linear in the swap par rate (though small non-linearities arise from the co-dependency of the swap rate with the discount factors in the Annuity sum). \n\nDuring the life of the swap the same valuation technique is used, but since, over time, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, the PV of the swap will deviate from its initial value. Therefore, the swap will be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. \nThe way these changes in value are reported is the subject of [[IAS 39]] for jurisdictions following [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]], and [[FAS 133]] for [[U.S. GAAP]]. \nSwaps are marked to market by debt security traders to visualize their inventory at a certain time. \nAs regards [[PnL Explained #Sensitivities method|P&L Attribution]], and hedging, the new framework adds complexity in that the trader's position is now potentially affected by numerous instruments not obviously related to the trade in question.\n\n==Risks==\nInterest rate swaps expose users to many different types of financial risk.<ref name=PTIRDs /> \nPredominantly they expose the user to [[market risk]]s and specifically [[interest rate risk]]. \nThe value of an interest rate swap will change as market interest rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as [[Greeks_(finance)#Delta|delta risk]]. \nInterest rate swaps also exhibit [[Greeks_(finance)#Gamma|gamma risk]] whereby their delta risk increases or decreases as market interest rates fluctuate. \n(See [[Greeks (finance)]], [[Value at risk #Computation methods]], [[Value at risk #VaR risk management]]. )\n\nOther specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are [[basis risk]]s - where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another - \nand [[Repricing risk|reset risks]] - where the [[Libor#Calculation|publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes]] are subject to daily fluctuation. \n\nUncollateralised interest rate swaps - those executed bilaterally without a CSA in place - expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and [[credit risk]]s. \nFunding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. \nCredit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps, on the other hand,  expose the users to collateral risks: here, depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. \n\nCredit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. \nRegardless, due to regulations set out in the [[Basel III]] Regulatory Frameworks, trading interest rate derivatives [[regulatory capital|commands a capital usage]]. The consequence of this is that, dependent upon their specific nature, interest rate swaps might command more capital usage, and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users. \n\nGiven these concerns, banks will typically calculate a [[credit valuation adjustment]], as well as other [[XVA|x-valuation adjustment]]s, which then incorporate these risks into the instrument value.\n\nReputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.\n\nHedging interest rate swaps can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks; although, see the discussion above re hedging in a multi-curve environment. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes.\n\n==Quotation and Market-Making==\n=== ISDA Benchmark Swap Rates ===\nISDA, ICAP, and Reuters select a number of swap dealers based on their reputation, credit standing and scale of activity in each major currency. Those dealers are asked to provide swap rates for the designated maturities of a given currency within a polling window. Reuters will calculate the benchmark swap rate based on a simple average of the submitted rates after eliminating the highest and lowest ones and publish them. \n\n===Market-Making===\nThe market-making of IRSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency.<ref name=PTIRDs />\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn June 1988 the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] was tipped off by someone working on the swaps desk of [[Goldman Sachs]] that the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] had a massive exposure to interest rate swaps. When the commission contacted the council, the chief executive told them not to worry as \"everybody knows that interest rates are going to fall\"; the treasurer thought the interest rate swaps were a \"nice little earner\". The Commission's Controller, [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]], realised that the council had put all of its positions on interest rates going down and ordered an investigation.\n\nBy January 1989 the Commission obtained legal opinions from two [[Queen's Counsel]]. Although they did not agree, the commission preferred the opinion that it was ''[[ultra vires]]'' for councils to engage in interest rate swaps (ie. that they had no lawful power to do so). Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the contracts declared void (appeals all the way up to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] failed in ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Audit Commission\">Duncan Campbell-Smith, \"Follow the Money: The Audit Commission, Public Money, and the Management of Public Services 1983-2008\", Allen Lane, 2008, chapter 6 ''passim''.</ref> This resulted in several cases in which the banks generally lost their claims for [[compound interest]] on debts to councils, finalised in ''[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council]]''.<ref>[1996] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html UKHL 12], [1996] AC 669</ref> Banks did, however, recover some funds where the derivatives were \"in the money\" for the Councils (ie, an asset showing a profit for the council, which it now had to return to the bank, not a debt)\n\nThe controversy surrounding interest rate swaps reached a peak in the UK during the financial crisis where banks sold unsuitable interest rate hedging products on a large scale to SMEs. The practice has been widely [https://lexlaw.co.uk/solicitors-london/uk-parliament-condemns-rbs-grg-mistreatment-sme-bank-misconduct-litigation-solicitors-london/ criticised] by the media and Parliament. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Swap rate]]\n* [[Interest rate cap and floor]]\n* [[Equity swap]]\n* [[Total return swap]]\n* [[Inflation derivative]]\n* [[Eurodollar]]\n* [[Constant maturity swap]]\n* [[FTSE MTIRS Index]]\n\n==Further reading==\nGeneral:\n*{{cite book | title = Interest Rate Modeling in Three Volumes | author = Leif B.G.

Govan began listening to [[Rock and roll|1950s rock 'n' roll]] artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]]; he then moved on to later eras, listening to such bands as [[The Beatles]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[AC/DC]], among others. He worked out chords and solos from listening to the records. Half-Scottish, Govan was also heavily influenced by [[Zal Cleminson]], a Scottish guitarist best known for his work with the [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q3ktPQZ3Do|title=The Players' Player Interview|magazine=Total Guitar|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> At the age of nine, Govan and his brother Seth played guitar on a [[Thames Television]] programme called Ace Reports. At secondary school he was exposed, via older classmates, to \"[[Shred guitar|shred]]\" guitarists of the time.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> His first electric guitar was a [[Gibson SG]], which he keeps at home.\n\n[[File:Guthrie Govan.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Guthrie govan.jpg|thumb]]\nAfter leaving school, Govan studied English at [[St_Catherine%27s_College,_Oxford|St Catherine's College]] at [[Oxford University]]. He dropped out after a year to pursue a career in music. Govan states that he was torn between continuing his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter. Around this time, (by Govan's own estimation, 1991<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite web|author= Owen Edwards |url= http://www.alloutguitar.com/interview/artists_and_bands/guthrie_govan_interview_the_virtuoso039s_virtuoso|title= Guthrie Govan Interview: The Virtuoso's Virtuoso|publisher= All Out Guitar|date= 30 August 2006|accessdate= 8 February 2008}}</ref>) he sent demos of his work to [[Mike Varney]] of [[Shrapnel Records]]. Varney was impressed and offered him a record deal. Govan declined, despite initiating contact in the first place. He explained that: \"it was as though all I really wanted to know was that I was good enough [\u2026] I found I was getting a bit weary of the shred movement.\"<ref name=\"martin\">Neville Martin, 'Guthrie Govan: Artist Interview', ''Guitar Techniques'', November 2006, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he won ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine's \"Guitarist of the Year\" competition with his instrumental piece Wonderful Slippery Thing. A version of this song was included on his debut solo album. The demo of the track earned him a place amongst several other entrants in the live final, which he then won. In the meantime, Govan hit upon the idea of transcribing music from records professionally, and submitted the most technically difficult piece he could think of (a [[Shawn Lane]] transcription) to ''[[Future Publishing|Guitar Techniques]]'' magazine. This earned him a job as a contributor to the magazine, ending a spell working in fast food.<ref name=\"edwards\"/>\n\n==Guitar Tuition==\nGovan has since worked with ''Guitar Techniques'',<ref name=\"edwards\"/> providing [[Transcription_(music)|transcriptions]] of songs, including his own track Wonderful Slippery Thing.<ref>Guthrie Govan, \"Guthrie Govan: Wonderful Slippery Thing\", ''Guitar Techniques'', April 2005, pp. 56\u201364</ref> Since the late 1990s, Govan has taught at the Guitar Institute in Acton, [[Thames Valley University]], and the Academy of Contemporary Music. He formerly taught at Brighton Institute of Modern Music, and is invited to teach in seminars, masterclasses and clinics all around the world. In this context, he is known for his ability to teach a wide range of styles.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> Govan has published two books on guitar playing: ''Creative Guitar Volume 1: Cutting Edge Techniques'' and ''Creative Guitar Volume 2: Advanced Techniques.''<ref>{{cite book|title= Creative Guitar: Cutting Edge Techniques v. 1 (Paperback)|id= {{ASIN|1860744672|country=uk}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Creative Guitar: Advanced Technqiues v.2: Advanced Technqiues Vol 2 (Paperback)|id= {{ASIN|1860744672|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\n==Playing Career in the 2000s==\n===Asia, GPS and The Young Punx===\nGovan began his involvement with Asia playing on the album ''Aura,'' after the band was unable to secure the services of their first two choices for guest guitarists: [[Brian May]] or [[Steve Lukather]]. Govan explained that he was then chosen as an \"affordable\" option for the band, which had not experienced recent chart success. With his work on the album complete, Govan was added to the Asia line-up for the tour to support the new album. He wrote an instrumental song, Bad Asteroid, which itself was based on material from Govan's early 1990s demo. He went on to play on the band's 2004 album ''Silent Nation''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bravewords.com/news/guitar-icon-guthrie-govan-talks-asia-in-new-interview-they-kind-of-faded-out-of-my-life-rather-than-i-left-them|title=Guitar Icon GUTHRIE GOVAN Talks ASIA In New Interview - \"They Kind Of Faded Out Of My Life, Rather Than I Left Them\"|last=bravewords.com|newspaper=bravewords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Asia keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]] decided to reform the band with its original 3 members. Govan and two other band members, bassist/singer [[John Payne (singer)|John Payne]] and [[Jay Schellen]], along with keyboardist [[Erik Norlander]] continued under the name [[Asia Featuring John Payne|Asia featuring John Payne]]. Govan left in mid-2009. He was replaced by virtuoso guitarist Mitch Perry, known for his work with [[Cher]], [[Ratt|RATT]], [[Lita Ford]], and the [[Michael Schenker Group]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bobby-blotzer-ratt-adds-guitarist-mitch-perry-bassist-brad-lang/|title=BOBBY BLOTZER's RATT Adds Guitarist MITCH PERRY, Bassist BRAD LANG|date=2016-08-14|newspaper=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nehrecords.com/shop/PerryProjects.htm|title=Neh Records Mitch Perry Biography|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref> Since Govan's departure from Asia featuring John Payne, they have gone on to considerable international success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraph.com/articles/version-40106-john-alton.html |title=Touring Asia: Longtime frontman John Payne brings own band version {{!}} version, john, alton - Features - The Telegraph |date=2011-07-23 |access-date=2016-11-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723072449/http://www.thetelegraph.com/articles/version-40106-john-alton.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nPayne, Govan and Schellen also formed [[GPS (band)|GPS]] (named after the members' initials), and after the addition of Ryo Okumoto on keyboards the band released the album ''Window to the Soul'' (2006). Most of the material on that album was written for a proposed Asia album, but was scrapped by Geoff Downes when he reunited the original line-up of Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingwall.jp/artist/gps/interview.html |title=GPS Interview |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009120507/http://www.dingwall.jp/artist/gps/interview.html |archivedate= 9 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGovan performs on a number of tracks on ''Your Music Is Killing Me'', the debut album of UK electronic dance music act [[The Young Punx]] and is part of their live act. He also appears in the music video for their track Rockall.\n\nGovan has played live guitar for [[Dizzee Rascal]], including a performance on [[Later With Jools Holland]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.guitar-techniques.com/page/guitartechniques?entry=guthrie_govan_with_dizzee_rascal|title= Guthrie Govan with Dizzee Rascal|publisher= Guitar Techniques|date= 24 September 2009|accessdate= 25 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic Cakes & The Fellowship===\nGovan's debut solo album, ''Erotic Cakes'', was released through Cornford Records in August 2006. In the album's sleeve notes, Govan states the album is a [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] reference (From the Episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\"); he also explains that when playing live, the band is billed as Erotic Cakes rather than simply Guthrie Govan.<ref name=\"sleevenotes\">''Erotic Cakes'', Cornford Records, 2006</ref> In addition to bass by Govan's brother Seth and drumming by Pete Riley, the album features guitar solos by [[Richie Kotzen]] (whose Los Angeles studio was used to record the guitar tracks on the album) on Ner Ner and [[Bumblefoot (musician)|Bumblefoot]] on Rhode Island Shred respectively. Seth Govan and Pete Riley also complete the Erotic Cakes live band. Previous versions of Waves and Rhode Island Shred appeared on the compilation ''Guitar on the Edge, Vol 1. no.4'' (Legato Records, 1993).<ref name=\"sleevenotes\"/> A version of his Guitarist of the Year winning piece, Wonderful Slippery Thing appears on the album. While this is his first album, Govan had been collaborating with drummer Pete Riley on the music since the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> Govan faced a set back after the albums were produced when several thousand copies of ''Erotic Cakes'' were stolen during a warehouse robbery and were never recovered, but the record company said that \"if the thieves can sell all of the records they have a job here with us\".\n\nThe Erotic Cakes band line up, with the addition of saxophonist Zak Barrett, also forms jazz-fusion band The Fellowship. The band used to play at the Bassment club in Chelmsford, Essex, every Thursday night and did so for several years. They continue to play at the Bassment club to this day, normally just two or three times a year.<ref name=\"edwards\"/><ref>{{cite web|author= Warren Timmis |url= http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/component/content/article/51-2009/10882-martin-taylor-stanton-moore-and-guthrie-govan-for-bath-guitar-festival|title= Martin Taylor, Stanton Moore and Guthrie Govan for Bath Guitar Festival|publisher= [[Jazzwise]]|date= 6 July 2009|accessdate= 18 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Playing Career in the 2010s==\n[[File:Guthrie Govan The Aristrocrats.jpg|thumb|Govan with [[The Aristocrats (band)|The Aristocrats]]]]\n\n=== The Aristocrats ===\nIn late 2011, Govan announced a new tour with a new band [[The Aristocrats (band)|The Aristocrats]], featuring [[Bryan Beller]] on bass and [[Marco Minnemann]] on drums. Their self-titled [[The Aristocrats (album)|debut]] album was released worldwide in September 2011, followed by [[Culture Clash (album)|Culture Clash]] in 2013.\nIn January 2015 The Aristocrats released their second live CD/DVD [[Culture Clash Live!]] through all official channels and a very special so-called official self-released bootleg double CD Secret Show - Live In Osaka which was only available in their own webstore and during the live concerts at the merchandise table. (no longer available)\nThe band's 3rd official studio album was released on 23 June 2015, and its title is [[Tres Caballeros]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Aristocrats {{!}} \"Tres Caballeros\" Is Out NOW!|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/news/tres-caballeros-is-out-now/|website=the-aristocrats-band.com|accessdate=2015-06-23|date=2015-06-23}}</ref>\nIn March 2019 The Aristocrats recorded their 4th studio album ([[You Know What...?]]) in the Brotheryn Studios (Ojai, CA), which was released June 28, 2019.\n\n===Steven Wilson===\nGovan was the lead guitarist in [[Steven Wilson]]'s band, performing on the critically acclaimed [[The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)| The Raven That Refused to Sing]], [[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]], and [[4\u00bd]] albums, and was a full-time touring member of Wilson's band until April 2015. These recordings captured what many agree to be some of the finest guitar playing in the history of the [[progressive rock]] genre, and introduced Govan to a broader global audience. Guthrie left Steven Wilson's band because of touring priorities with The Aristocrats whose touring schedule was clashing with Wilson's. Guthrie recommended Dave Kilminster as his replacement.\n\n===Hans Zimmer===\nSince 2016 Guthrie Govan is also the lead guitarist in [[Hans Zimmer Live]] live band and has toured the world with this ensemble. Hans found Guthrie on YouTube where he saw Guthrie play a fretless guitar. After some messages were exchanged on Guthrie's official Facebook page (Guthrie thought he was dealing with an imposter first, until Hans sent him his private phone number and asked Guthrie to call him), he has been part of the live band but also has been contributing already to a few Hans Zimmer soundtracks like ''The Boss Baby'' (2017), ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' (2019) and ''The Lion King'' (2019).\n\n===Other Projects===\nIn 2013, Govan held a guitar workshop with [[Paul Gilbert]]. He is also one of the guest stars on [[Michael Angelo Batio]]'s album ''Intermezzo'', released in November 2013. Guthrie was also a guest guitarist on one song, '' Electric in My Veins'', in Nick Johnston's solo album, ''In a Locked Room on the Moon''.<ref>{{cite web|title=In A Locked Room On The Moon {{!}} Nick Johnston|url=http://nickjohnstonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-a-locked-room-on-the-moon|website=Bandcamp|accessdate=2015-02-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227105111/http://nickjohnstonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-a-locked-room-on-the-moon|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Govan played alongside [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Steve Vai]] in G3 2016 touring across Europe.\nThe trek made its way through Italy and Germany and featured support from Mike Keneally on guitar, keyboards and vocals as well as Govan\u2019s band, the Aristocrats: bassist [[Bryan Beller]] and drummer [[Marco Minnemann]].\n\nIn 2019, Govan organized the Tony Mills Festival to honor his ailing collaborator [[Tony Mills (musician)|Tony Mills]].  Govan played a set of all Mills' originals at the festival.\n<ref>http://blackswan-musicschool.com/tony_mills_festival    </ref>\n\n==Solo Tours & Guitar Masterclasses==\nSince 2015 Guthrie Govan has been undertaking more frequently solo tours, mostly in Asia where he has a lot of fans requesting him to perform live. He has toured extensively since then (when there were no tours scheduled with The Aristocrats or Hans Zimmer) across India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Philippines, South Korea & Japan. In India he has been using in his band drummer [[Gino Banks]] and protege bass player [[Mohini Dey]], both high profiled players in India. For concerts in Japan he relies on protege drummer [[Senri Kawaguchi]], keyboard player [[Akira Ishiguro]] and bassist [[Mohini Dey]]. During tours in Russia he teamed up with bassist [[Anton Davidyants]] and Hungarian drummer [[Gergo Borlai]]\n\nGuthrie is also a very in demand clinician often undertaking specialised guitar masterclasses around the globe. He has been teaching in every continent.\n\n==Influences and Technique==\nGovan is known for his virtuoso command of the guitar, due to both his technical ability and proficiency in various styles. A 2006 interview hailed him as the \"virtuoso's virtuoso\" and said of him, \"Guthrie Govan is recognised by his peers as possibly the scariest guitarist alive. Combining an unparalleled technical ability with a mastery of almost all styles, Guthrie is comfortable comping in a traditional jazz combo as he is performing death-defying 'shred' guitar. Coupled with some seriously funky grooves and an encyclopaedic knowledge of popular music styles, a wonderfully developed slide style and improvisational abilities to match anyone, he may just be the most complete guitarist out there\".\n\nGovan's earliest influences were [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream-era]] [[Eric Clapton]]; as such he describes himself as coming from a \"blues rock background\".<ref name=\"edwards\"/> While he is \"wary\" of 1980s technique driven guitar music (\"shred\") he cites the imagination of [[Steve Vai]] (as well as [[Frank Zappa]], with whom Vai played) and the passion of [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]. Jazz and fusion elements are an important part of his style: he cites [[Joe Pass]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[John Scofield]] as pivotal influences in this respect.<ref name=\"martin\"/> He also admires a lot of modern guitar players with different styles such as [[Derek Trucks]] and [[Alex Machacek]]. Although a very able player in a diversity of styles, Govan has a distinct playing style typically characterised by long, smooth runs often using chromatic notes to \"fill in gaps\", his fast and fluid tapping up and down the neck, funky slapping, and occasional use of extreme effects. Govan has said that the guitar is simply a \"typewriter\" for getting a musical message across. Due to his experience in listening to music and working out riffs, Govan states that he is often able to visualise playing in his head without even playing and said that he pretty much has all of the notes in his head before writing something or learning to play something to produce the sounds that he wants.\n\n==Equipment== \n\nAn overview of all past and current gear <ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/gear/ |title=The Aristocrats - Gear page |publisher=The-Aristocrats-Band.com |date=8 January 2020 |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref> Guthrie Govan uses.\n\n===Guitars===\n\nIn October 2012, Govan was seen using a [[Charvel]] guitar on tour, is was later confirmed to be a (koa) prototype. Govan stated in January 2013 that he and Suhr parted ways officially.\n\nIn July 2013, Charvel made it official that they had joined forces with Govan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charvel.com/blog/2013/07/charvel-joins-forces-with-guthrie-govan/ |title=Charvel Joins Forces With Guthrie Govan &#124; Charvel Guitars |publisher=Charvel.com |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> who had been using their guitars for a few months. \n\nGovan's model sported a caramelised basswood body, birdseye maple top, a caramelised maple neck, Sperzel locking tuners, custom pick-ups by Michael Frank-Braun and a custom in-house developed (floating) tremolo bridge similar in design to a Floyd Rose, but without fine-tuners. \n\nIn January 2014 at the NAMM Show, Charvel officially introduced the Charvel USA Guthrie Govan Signature Model in two versions: one with a Birdseye Maple top and the other with a Flame Maple top, both equipped with custom pickups. In 2017 Charvel added a newer lighter baked Ash body signature model to the GG-signature models and upgraded the former models with a single coil-humbucker switch.\n\nIn the past he has used [[Suhr Guitars]]: three different Guthrie Govan Signature Model guitars, three custom Standards, a Modern 24-fret model, a Classic and Classic T.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suhrguitars.com/artists.aspx?artist=govan|title=Suhr Artists: Guthrie Govan|publisher=Suhr Guitars|accessdate=8 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313122243/http://www.suhrguitars.com/artists.aspx?artist=govan|archivedate=13 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He also plays Vigier fretless guitar (not endorsed).\n\n===Amplifiers===\nSince 2013, Govan has started using amplifiers designed and produced by Victory Amplification for both Steven Wilson and the Aristocrats tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/gear/ |title=The Aristocrats &#124; Gear |publisher=The-aristocrats-band.com |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> He has been working closely with designer Martin Kidd (who was originally the brain behind the Cornford amps) getting the V30 and V30 Mk II made the way he likes a tube amp to sound like. Ever since 2013 Guthrie has been taking his carry-on V30 across the globe.\nFor the Hans Zimmer tours Govan uses a Kemper profiler, because with an orchestra on stage and using in-ears it is not advised to blast some loud noises through a cabinet.\n\nIn the past Govan also has used Cornford amps: the sleeve notes of ''Erotic Cakes'' state he has used an RK100, MK50 and Hellcat.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> In the European tour of 2010 and 2011 he played Brunetti amplifiers (CustomWork Mercury 50) like his friend [[Dave Kilminster]]. \nWith \"The Aristocrats\" he was using Suhr Badger 30 amps live as well as a CAA PT-100 and the Badger 30 on the debut album.\n\n===Cabinets===\nGuthrie Govan, as stated before, uses his beloved Victory V30 MkII amplifier but to get the desired tone he prefers to use 4 x 12 cabinets with Celestion V30 Vintage speakers inside, slightly having a preference for cabinets made by Mesa (for the thick wood), Orange, Bogner.\n\n===Pedals===\nGovan has been an analog fan concerning pedals, but since a few years (since 2016) he has been moving towards using a Fractal FX-8 live on tours. The small footprint makes it easier traveling for a musician and the current digital solution comes extremely close to the former analog experiences.\n\n===Strings===\nGuthrie uses [http://www.daddario.com/DaddarioArtistDetails.Page?ActiveID=3777&ArtistId=47663&sid=c6232e0f-8879-4bec-9ec9-21862fbbe217 D'Addario] guitar strings (NYXL 10-46) since October 2018.

More recently, he has collaborated with [[Steven Wilson]] and [[Hans Zimmer]]. He is a noted guitar teacher, working with the UK magazine ''Guitar Techniques'', Guildford's Academy of Contemporary Music,  Lick Library, and formerly the [[Brighton Institute of Modern Music]]. Govan was named \"Guitarist of the Year\" by ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine in 1993.\n\n==Biography and Early Career==\nGovan began playing guitar aged three, encouraged by his father, but initially learning mainly by ear. His father taught him three chords first, and introduced him to his record collection. Govan began listening to [[Rock and roll|1950s rock 'n' roll]] artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]]; he then moved on to later eras, listening to such bands as [[The Beatles]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[AC/DC]], among others. He worked out chords and solos from listening to the records. Half-Scottish, Govan was also heavily influenced by [[Zal Cleminson]], a Scottish guitarist best known for his work with the [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q3ktPQZ3Do|title=The Players' Player Interview|magazine=Total Guitar|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> At the age of nine, Govan and his brother Seth played guitar on a [[Thames Television]] programme called Ace Reports. At secondary school he was exposed, via older classmates, to \"[[Shred guitar|shred]]\" guitarists of the time.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> His first electric guitar was a [[Gibson SG]], which he keeps at home.\n\n[[File:Guthrie Govan.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Guthrie govan.jpg|thumb]]\nAfter leaving school, Govan studied English at [[St_Catherine%27s_College,_Oxford|St Catherine's College]] at [[Oxford University]]. He dropped out after a year to pursue a career in music. Govan states that he was torn between continuing his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter. Around this time, (by Govan's own estimation, 1991<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite web|author= Owen Edwards |url= http://www.alloutguitar.com/interview/artists_and_bands/guthrie_govan_interview_the_virtuoso039s_virtuoso|title= Guthrie Govan Interview: The Virtuoso's Virtuoso|publisher= All Out Guitar|date= 30 August 2006|accessdate= 8 February 2008}}</ref>) he sent demos of his work to [[Mike Varney]] of [[Shrapnel Records]]. Varney was impressed and offered him a record deal. Govan declined, despite initiating contact in the first place. He explained that: \"it was as though all I really wanted to know was that I was good enough [\u2026] I found I was getting a bit weary of the shred movement.\"<ref name=\"martin\">Neville Martin, 'Guthrie Govan: Artist Interview', ''Guitar Techniques'', November 2006, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he won ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine's \"Guitarist of the Year\" competition with his instrumental piece Wonderful Slippery Thing. A version of this song was included on his debut solo album. The demo of the track earned him a place amongst several other entrants in the live final, which he then won. In the meantime, Govan hit upon the idea of transcribing music from records professionally, and submitted the most technically difficult piece he could think of (a [[Shawn Lane]] transcription) to ''[[Future Publishing|Guitar Techniques]]'' magazine. This earned him a job as a contributor to the magazine, ending a spell working in fast food.<ref name=\"edwards\"/>\n\n==Guitar Tuition==\nGovan has since worked with ''Guitar Techniques'',<ref name=\"edwards\"/> providing [[Transcription_(music)|transcriptions]] of songs, including his own track Wonderful Slippery Thing.<ref>Guthrie Govan, \"Guthrie Govan: Wonderful Slippery Thing\", ''Guitar Techniques'', April 2005, pp. 56\u201364</ref> Since the late 1990s, Govan has taught at the Guitar Institute in Acton, [[Thames Valley University]], and the Academy of Contemporary Music. He formerly taught at Brighton Institute of Modern Music, and is invited to teach in seminars, masterclasses and clinics all around the world. In this context, he is known for his ability to teach a wide range of styles.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> Govan has published two books on guitar playing: ''Creative Guitar Volume 1: Cutting Edge Techniques'' and ''Creative Guitar Volume 2: Advanced Techniques.''<ref>{{cite book|title= Creative Guitar: Cutting Edge Techniques v. 1 (Paperback)|id= {{ASIN|1860744672|country=uk}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Creative Guitar: Advanced Technqiues v.2: Advanced Technqiues Vol 2 (Paperback)|id= {{ASIN|1860744672|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\n==Playing Career in the 2000s==\n===Asia, GPS and The Young Punx===\nGovan began his involvement with Asia playing on the album ''Aura,'' after the band was unable to secure the services of their first two choices for guest guitarists: [[Brian May]] or [[Steve Lukather]]. Govan explained that he was then chosen as an \"affordable\" option for the band, which had not experienced recent chart success. With his work on the album complete, Govan was added to the Asia line-up for the tour to support the new album. He wrote an instrumental song, Bad Asteroid, which itself was based on material from Govan's early 1990s demo. He went on to play on the band's 2004 album ''Silent Nation''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bravewords.com/news/guitar-icon-guthrie-govan-talks-asia-in-new-interview-they-kind-of-faded-out-of-my-life-rather-than-i-left-them|title=Guitar Icon GUTHRIE GOVAN Talks ASIA In New Interview - \"They Kind Of Faded Out Of My Life, Rather Than I Left Them\"|last=bravewords.com|newspaper=bravewords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Asia keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]] decided to reform the band with its original 3 members. Govan and two other band members, bassist/singer [[John Payne (singer)|John Payne]] and [[Jay Schellen]], along with keyboardist [[Erik Norlander]] continued under the name [[Asia Featuring John Payne|Asia featuring John Payne]]. Govan left in mid-2009. He was replaced by virtuoso guitarist Mitch Perry, known for his work with [[Cher]], [[Ratt|RATT]], [[Lita Ford]], and the [[Michael Schenker Group]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bobby-blotzer-ratt-adds-guitarist-mitch-perry-bassist-brad-lang/|title=BOBBY BLOTZER's RATT Adds Guitarist MITCH PERRY, Bassist BRAD LANG|date=2016-08-14|newspaper=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nehrecords.com/shop/PerryProjects.htm|title=Neh Records Mitch Perry Biography|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref> Since Govan's departure from Asia featuring John Payne, they have gone on to considerable international success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraph.com/articles/version-40106-john-alton.html |title=Touring Asia: Longtime frontman John Payne brings own band version {{!}} version, john, alton - Features - The Telegraph |date=2011-07-23 |access-date=2016-11-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723072449/http://www.thetelegraph.com/articles/version-40106-john-alton.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nPayne, Govan and Schellen also formed [[GPS (band)|GPS]] (named after the members' initials), and after the addition of Ryo Okumoto on keyboards the band released the album ''Window to the Soul'' (2006). Most of the material on that album was written for a proposed Asia album, but was scrapped by Geoff Downes when he reunited the original line-up of Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingwall.jp/artist/gps/interview.html |title=GPS Interview |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009120507/http://www.dingwall.jp/artist/gps/interview.html |archivedate= 9 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGovan performs on a number of tracks on ''Your Music Is Killing Me'', the debut album of UK electronic dance music act [[The Young Punx]] and is part of their live act. He also appears in the music video for their track Rockall.\n\nGovan has played live guitar for [[Dizzee Rascal]], including a performance on [[Later With Jools Holland]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.guitar-techniques.com/page/guitartechniques?entry=guthrie_govan_with_dizzee_rascal|title= Guthrie Govan with Dizzee Rascal|publisher= Guitar Techniques|date= 24 September 2009|accessdate= 25 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic Cakes & The Fellowship===\nGovan's debut solo album, ''Erotic Cakes'', was released through Cornford Records in August 2006. In the album's sleeve notes, Govan states the album is a [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] reference (From the Episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\"); he also explains that when playing live, the band is billed as Erotic Cakes rather than simply Guthrie Govan.<ref name=\"sleevenotes\">''Erotic Cakes'', Cornford Records, 2006</ref> In addition to bass by Govan's brother Seth and drumming by Pete Riley, the album features guitar solos by [[Richie Kotzen]] (whose Los Angeles studio was used to record the guitar tracks on the album) on Ner Ner and [[Bumblefoot (musician)|Bumblefoot]] on Rhode Island Shred respectively. Seth Govan and Pete Riley also complete the Erotic Cakes live band. Previous versions of Waves and Rhode Island Shred appeared on the compilation ''Guitar on the Edge, Vol 1. no.4'' (Legato Records, 1993).<ref name=\"sleevenotes\"/> A version of his Guitarist of the Year winning piece, Wonderful Slippery Thing appears on the album. While this is his first album, Govan had been collaborating with drummer Pete Riley on the music since the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> Govan faced a set back after the albums were produced when several thousand copies of ''Erotic Cakes'' were stolen during a warehouse robbery and were never recovered, but the record company said that \"if the thieves can sell all of the records they have a job here with us\".\n\nThe Erotic Cakes band line up, with the addition of saxophonist Zak Barrett, also forms jazz-fusion band The Fellowship. The band used to play at the Bassment club in Chelmsford, Essex, every Thursday night and did so for several years. They continue to play at the Bassment club to this day, normally just two or three times a year.<ref name=\"edwards\"/><ref>{{cite web|author= Warren Timmis |url= http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/component/content/article/51-2009/10882-martin-taylor-stanton-moore-and-guthrie-govan-for-bath-guitar-festival|title= Martin Taylor, Stanton Moore and Guthrie Govan for Bath Guitar Festival|publisher= [[Jazzwise]]|date= 6 July 2009|accessdate= 18 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Playing Career in the 2010s==\n[[File:Guthrie Govan The Aristrocrats.jpg|thumb|Govan with [[The Aristocrats (band)|The Aristocrats]]]]\n\n=== The Aristocrats ===\nIn late 2011, Govan announced a new tour with a new band [[The Aristocrats (band)|The Aristocrats]], featuring [[Bryan Beller]] on bass and [[Marco Minnemann]] on drums. Their self-titled [[The Aristocrats (album)|debut]] album was released worldwide in September 2011, followed by [[Culture Clash (album)|Culture Clash]] in 2013.\nIn January 2015 The Aristocrats released their second live CD/DVD [[Culture Clash Live!]] through all official channels and a very special so-called official self-released bootleg double CD Secret Show - Live In Osaka which was only available in their own webstore and during the live concerts at the merchandise table. (no longer available)\nThe band's 3rd official studio album was released on 23 June 2015, and its title is [[Tres Caballeros]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Aristocrats {{!}} \"Tres Caballeros\" Is Out NOW!|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/news/tres-caballeros-is-out-now/|website=the-aristocrats-band.com|accessdate=2015-06-23|date=2015-06-23}}</ref>\nIn March 2019 The Aristocrats recorded their 4th studio album ([[You Know What...?]]) in the Brotheryn Studios (Ojai, CA), which was released June 28, 2019.\n\n===Steven Wilson===\nGovan was the lead guitarist in [[Steven Wilson]]'s band, performing on the critically acclaimed [[The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)| The Raven That Refused to Sing]], [[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]], and [[4\u00bd]] albums, and was a full-time touring member of Wilson's band until April 2015. These recordings captured what many agree to be some of the finest guitar playing in the history of the [[progressive rock]] genre, and introduced Govan to a broader global audience. Guthrie left Steven Wilson's band because of touring priorities with The Aristocrats whose touring schedule was clashing with Wilson's. Guthrie recommended Dave Kilminster as his replacement.\n\n===Hans Zimmer===\nSince 2016 Guthrie Govan is also the lead guitarist in [[Hans Zimmer Live]] live band and has toured the world with this ensemble. Hans found Guthrie on YouTube where he saw Guthrie play a fretless guitar. After some messages were exchanged on Guthrie's official Facebook page (Guthrie thought he was dealing with an imposter first, until Hans sent him his private phone number and asked Guthrie to call him), he has been part of the live band but also has been contributing already to a few Hans Zimmer soundtracks like ''The Boss Baby'' (2017), ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' (2019) and ''The Lion King'' (2019).\n\n===Other Projects===\nIn 2013, Govan held a guitar workshop with [[Paul Gilbert]]. He is also one of the guest stars on [[Michael Angelo Batio]]'s album ''Intermezzo'', released in November 2013. Guthrie was also a guest guitarist on one song, '' Electric in My Veins'', in Nick Johnston's solo album, ''In a Locked Room on the Moon''.<ref>{{cite web|title=In A Locked Room On The Moon {{!}} Nick Johnston|url=http://nickjohnstonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-a-locked-room-on-the-moon|website=Bandcamp|accessdate=2015-02-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227105111/http://nickjohnstonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-a-locked-room-on-the-moon|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Govan played alongside [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Steve Vai]] in G3 2016 touring across Europe.\nThe trek made its way through Italy and Germany and featured support from Mike Keneally on guitar, keyboards and vocals as well as Govan\u2019s band, the Aristocrats: bassist [[Bryan Beller]] and drummer [[Marco Minnemann]].\n\nIn 2019, Govan organized the Tony Mills Festival to honor his ailing collaborator [[Tony Mills (musician)|Tony Mills]].  Govan played a set of all Mills' originals at the festival.\n<ref>http://blackswan-musicschool.com/tony_mills_festival    </ref>\n\n==Solo Tours & Guitar Masterclasses==\nSince 2015 Guthrie Govan has been undertaking more frequently solo tours, mostly in Asia where he has a lot of fans requesting him to perform live. He has toured extensively since then (when there were no tours scheduled with The Aristocrats or Hans Zimmer) across India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Philippines, South Korea & Japan. In India he has been using in his band drummer [[Gino Banks]] and protege bass player [[Mohini Dey]], both high profiled players in India. For concerts in Japan he relies on protege drummer [[Senri Kawaguchi]], keyboard player [[Akira Ishiguro]] and bassist [[Mohini Dey]]. During tours in Russia he teamed up with bassist [[Anton Davidyants]] and Hungarian drummer [[Gergo Borlai]]\n\nGuthrie is also a very in demand clinician often undertaking specialised guitar masterclasses around the globe. He has been teaching in every continent.\n\n==Influences and Technique==\nGovan is known for his virtuoso command of the guitar, due to both his technical ability and proficiency in various styles. A 2006 interview hailed him as the \"virtuoso's virtuoso\" and said of him, \"Guthrie Govan is recognised by his peers as possibly the scariest guitarist alive. Combining an unparalleled technical ability with a mastery of almost all styles, Guthrie is comfortable comping in a traditional jazz combo as he is performing death-defying 'shred' guitar. Coupled with some seriously funky grooves and an encyclopaedic knowledge of popular music styles, a wonderfully developed slide style and improvisational abilities to match anyone, he may just be the most complete guitarist out there\".\n\nGovan's earliest influences were [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream-era]] [[Eric Clapton]]; as such he describes himself as coming from a \"blues rock background\".<ref name=\"edwards\"/> While he is \"wary\" of 1980s technique driven guitar music (\"shred\") he cites the imagination of [[Steve Vai]] (as well as [[Frank Zappa]], with whom Vai played) and the passion of [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]. Jazz and fusion elements are an important part of his style: he cites [[Joe Pass]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[John Scofield]] as pivotal influences in this respect.<ref name=\"martin\"/> He also admires a lot of modern guitar players with different styles such as [[Derek Trucks]] and [[Alex Machacek]]. Although a very able player in a diversity of styles, Govan has a distinct playing style typically characterised by long, smooth runs often using chromatic notes to \"fill in gaps\", his fast and fluid tapping up and down the neck, funky slapping, and occasional use of extreme effects. Govan has said that the guitar is simply a \"typewriter\" for getting a musical message across. Due to his experience in listening to music and working out riffs, Govan states that he is often able to visualise playing in his head without even playing and said that he pretty much has all of the notes in his head before writing something or learning to play something to produce the sounds that he wants.\n\n==Equipment== \n\nAn overview of all past and current gear <ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/gear/ |title=The Aristocrats - Gear page |publisher=The-Aristocrats-Band.com |date=8 January 2020 |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref> Guthrie Govan uses.\n\n===Guitars===\n\nIn October 2012, Govan was seen using a [[Charvel]] guitar on tour, is was later confirmed to be a (koa) prototype. Govan stated in January 2013 that he and Suhr parted ways officially.\n\nIn July 2013, Charvel made it official that they had joined forces with Govan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charvel.com/blog/2013/07/charvel-joins-forces-with-guthrie-govan/ |title=Charvel Joins Forces With Guthrie Govan &#124; Charvel Guitars |publisher=Charvel.com |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> who had been using their guitars for a few months. \n\nGovan's model sported a caramelised basswood body, birdseye maple top, a caramelised maple neck, Sperzel locking tuners, custom pick-ups by Michael Frank-Braun and a custom in-house developed (floating) tremolo bridge similar in design to a Floyd Rose, but without fine-tuners. \n\nIn January 2014 at the NAMM Show, Charvel officially introduced the Charvel USA Guthrie Govan Signature Model in two versions: one with a Birdseye Maple top and the other with a Flame Maple top, both equipped with custom pickups. In 2017 Charvel added a newer lighter baked Ash body signature model to the GG-signature models and upgraded the former models with a single coil-humbucker switch.\n\nIn the past he has used [[Suhr Guitars]]: three different Guthrie Govan Signature Model guitars, three custom Standards, a Modern 24-fret model, a Classic and Classic T.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suhrguitars.com/artists.aspx?artist=govan|title=Suhr Artists: Guthrie Govan|publisher=Suhr Guitars|accessdate=8 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313122243/http://www.suhrguitars.com/artists.aspx?artist=govan|archivedate=13 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He also plays Vigier fretless guitar (not endorsed).\n\n===Amplifiers===\nSince 2013, Govan has started using amplifiers designed and produced by Victory Amplification for both Steven Wilson and the Aristocrats tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-aristocrats-band.com/gear/ |title=The Aristocrats &#124; Gear |publisher=The-aristocrats-band.com |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> He has been working closely with designer Martin Kidd (who was originally the brain behind the Cornford amps) getting the V30 and V30 Mk II made the way he likes a tube amp to sound like. Ever since 2013 Guthrie has been taking his carry-on V30 across the globe.\nFor the Hans Zimmer tours Govan uses a Kemper profiler, because with an orchestra on stage and using in-ears it is not advised to blast some loud noises through a cabinet.\n\nIn the past Govan also has used Cornford amps: the sleeve notes of ''Erotic Cakes'' state he has used an RK100, MK50 and Hellcat.<ref name=\"edwards\"/> In the European tour of 2010 and 2011 he played Brunetti amplifiers (CustomWork Mercury 50) like his friend [[Dave Kilminster]]. \nWith \"The Aristocrats\" he was using Suhr Badger 30 amps live as well as a CAA PT-100 and the Badger 30 on the debut album.\n\n===Cabinets===\nGuthrie Govan, as stated before, uses his beloved Victory V30 MkII amplifier but to get the desired tone he prefers to use 4 x 12 cabinets with Celestion V30 Vintage speakers inside, slightly having a preference for cabinets made by Mesa (for the thick wood), Orange, Bogner.\n\n===Pedals===\nGovan has been an analog fan concerning pedals, but since a few years (since 2016) he has been moving towards using a Fractal FX-8 live on tours.

Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''\n\n== Early life ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyNbCRQsck 'Weird Al' Yankovic \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 7:02, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title ='Weird Al' Yankovic Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website = | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = July 30, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/weird-al-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | accessdate =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\nYankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]].

Yankovic said he had originally been nicknamed \"Weird Al\" by fellow students and \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson.

The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film. The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.\n\nYankovic and his band toured as the opening act for [[The Monkees]] in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of North America.

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs.

The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''.

DASHBot-->}}</ref> His works have earned him five [[Grammy Award]]s and a further eleven nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''.

Yankovic said he had originally been nicknamed \"Weird Al\" by fellow students and \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson.

The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later.

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season. The entire series was released on DVD by [[Shout! Factory]] on August 15, 2006.\n\n[[VH1]] produced a ''[[Behind the Music]]'' episode on Yankovic. His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the \"Behind the Music Remastered\" series.\n\nYankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | accessdate=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation and voice work ===\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series.
