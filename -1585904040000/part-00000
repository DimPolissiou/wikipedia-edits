He was [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Lordship of Ibelin|lord of Ibelin]] from 1170-1193.  As the leader of the defense of the city during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 1187, he surrendered Jerusalem to [[Saladin]] on October 2, 1187. \n\n==Early years==\n\nBalian was the youngest son of [[Barisan of Ibelin]], and brother of [[Hugh of Ibelin|Hugh]] and [[Baldwin of Ibelin|Baldwin]]. His father, a knight in the [[County of Jaffa]], had been rewarded with the [[lordship of Ibelin]] after the revolt of [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]]. Barisan married [[Helvis of Ramla]], heiress of the wealthy [[lordship of Ramla]]. Balian's name was also Barisan, but he seems to have adapted the name to the [[Old French language|Old French]] \"Balian\" c. 1175\u201376; he is sometimes known as Balian the Younger or Balian II when his father is also referred to as Balian. He is also called Balian of [[Ramla]] or Balian of [[Nablus]]. In [[Latin]] his name appears variously as Balian, Barisan, Barisanus, Balianus, Balisan, and Balisanus. Arabic sources call him ''Balian ibn Barzan'' which translates \"Balian, son of Barzan (or Barisan). His precise year of birth is unknown, but he was of the age of majority (usually 15) by 1158, when he first appears in [[charter]]s, having been described as under-age (\"''infra annos''\") in 1156.\n\nAfter the death of Balian's eldest brother Hugh c. 1169, the [[Ibelin (castle)|castle of Ibelin]] passed to the next brother, Baldwin. Baldwin, preferring to remain lord of Ramla, gave it to Balian. Balian held Ibelin as a [[vassal]] of his brother, and indirectly as a [[vavasour|rear-vassal]] of the king, from whom Baldwin held Ramla.\n\n==Succession disputes==\nBaldwin supported [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] over [[Miles of Plancy]] as regent for [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV]] in 1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the [[Battle of Montgisard]], leading the vanguard victoriously against the strongest point of the Muslim line. That year Balian also married [[Maria Komnene, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]], becoming stepfather to Amalric's younger daughter [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]]. He received the lordship of [[Nablus]], which had been a [[dower]] gift to Maria following her marriage to Amalric. In 1179, Baldwin of Ramla was captured by [[Saladin]] after the [[Battle of Jacob's Ford]], and Balian helped arrange for his ransom and release the next year; the ransom was eventually paid by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], Maria's great-uncle.\n\nIn 1183 Balian and Baldwin supported Raymond against [[Guy of Lusignan]], husband of Amalric's elder daughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] and by now regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of [[leprosy]]. The king had his 5-year-old nephew [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Montferrat]] crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, in an attempt to prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. It was Balian himself\u2014a notably tall man\u2014who carried the child Baldwin V on his shoulder at the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to [[Antioch]]. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.\n\n==Dispute between Raymond and Guy==\nBalian remained in the kingdom, as an advisor to Guy. At the end of 1186, [[Saladin]], the sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Damascus]], threatened the borders of the kingdom after Guy's ally [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], [[Lord of Oultrejordain]], had attacked a Muslim caravan. Saladin was allied with the garrison of [[Tiberias]] in the north of the kingdom, a territory held by Raymond III. Guy gathered his army at [[Nazareth]], planning to besiege Tiberias, but Balian disagreed with this, and instead suggested that Guy send an emissary to Raymond in Tripoli, hoping the two could be reconciled before Guy made a foolish attack on Saladin's larger army. The first embassy was a failure and the situation remained unchanged throughout the early months of 1187. After [[Easter]] of that year, Balian, [[Gerard of Ridefort]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]]), [[Roger de Moulins]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]), [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre]] were sent on a new embassy to Tripoli. During the journey they stopped at Balian's fief of Nablus, and Balian planned to remain behind briefly while the others went ahead. On May 1, the Templars and Hospitallers were defeated by Saladin's son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah al-din|al-Afdal]] at the [[Battle of Cresson]]; Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at [[Samaria|Sebastea]] to celebrate a [[feast day]]. After reaching the castle of La F\u00e8ve, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted, and soon heard news of the disastrous battle from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem.\n\n==The Battle of Hattin==\nSince al-Afdal's army had been allowed to enter the kingdom through their alliance with Raymond, the count now regretted his actions and reconciled with Guy. Guy marched north and camped at [[Sephoria]], but insisted on marching the army across a dry and barren plain to relieve Tiberias. The army had no water and was constantly harassed by Saladin's troops, and was finally surrounded at the Horns of [[Hattin]] outside Tiberias early in July. In the [[Battle of Hattin]] that followed on July 4, Balian and [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] commanded the rearguard, but the crusader army was completely defeated. The anonymous text, ''[[De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus]]'' claims that Balian, Raymond and Reginald of Sidon fled the field in the middle of the battle, trampling \"''the Christians, the Turks and the Cross''\" in the process\u2014but this is not corroborated by other accounts, and likely reflects the author's hostility to the ''Poleins'' (a European born in the [[Levant]]).\n\nThe defeat led to a changing of the guard in Jerusalem: King Guy was taken prisoner, and nearly every town and castle soon fell to Saladin. Balian, Raymond, Reginald, and Payen of Haifa were among the few leading nobles who managed to escape to [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Raymond and Reginald soon left to attend to the defence of their own territories, and Tyre came under the leadership of [[Conrad of Montferrat]], Baldwin V's paternal uncle, who had arrived not long after Hattin. Balian was to become one of his closest allies. Leaving Tyre, Balian asked Saladin for permission to return through the lines to Jerusalem to escort his wife and their children to Tripoli. Saladin allowed this, provided that Balian leave the city and take an oath to never raise arms against him.\n\n==Defense of Jerusalem==\n[[File:BalianofIbelin1490.jpg|right|frame|Balian of Ibelin surrendering the city of [[Jerusalem]] to [[Saladin]], from ''Les Passages faits Outremer par les Fran\u00e7ais contre les Turcs et autres Sarrasins et Maures outremarins'', c. 1490.]]\nWhen Balian and his small group of knights arrived in the city, the inhabitants begged them to stay, and Balian was absolved of his oath to Saladin by [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]], who argued that the greater need of Christendom was stronger than his oath to a non-Christian. Balian was recruited to lead the defense of the city, but he found that there were under fourteen, possibly as few as two, other knights there, so he created 60 new knights from the ranks of the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es. [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Queen Sibylla]] seems to have played little part in the defence, and oaths were taken to Balian as lord. With Eraclius, he prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. Saladin indeed began the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of Jerusalem]] on September 20, 1187, after he had conquered almost all of the rest of the kingdom, including Ibelin, Nablus, Ramla, and Ascalon. The sultan felt no ill-will to Balian for breaking his oath, and arranged for an escort to accompany Maria and their children to Tripoli. As the highest ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, Balian, as [[Ibn al-Athir]] wrote, was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank \"more or less equal to that of a king.\"\n\nSaladin was able to knock down portions of the walls, but was unable to gain entrance to the city. Balian then rode out to meet with the sultan, to report to him that the defenders would rather kill each other and destroy the city than see it taken by force. After negotiations, it was decided that the city would be handed over peacefully, and that Saladin would free seven thousand men for 30,000 [[bezants]]; two women or ten children would be permitted to take the place of one man for the same price. Balian handed over the keys to the [[Tower of David]] (the citadel) on October 2. There was a 50-day period for the payment of ransoms. Those who could not pay for their freedom were forced into slavery; Saladin freed some of them, however, and allowed for an orderly march away from Jerusalem, preventing the sort of massacre that had occurred when the Crusaders captured the city in 1099. Balian and Patriarch Eraclius had offered themselves as hostages for the ransoming of the remaining Frankish citizens, but Saladin had refused. The ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns. Balian and the Patriarch led the third, which was the last to leave the city, probably around November 20. Balian joined his wife and children in [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]].\n\n==Balian as king-maker, and the Third Crusade==\nThe fall of Jerusalem, and the death of Sibylla at the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]] in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's stepdaughter Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey\u2014who had let her cause down in 1186\u2014remained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being [[Conrad of Montferrat]], who also had some claim as [[Baldwin V]]'s paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.\n\nIsabella's marriage was annulled by [[Ubaldo Lanfranchi]], [[Archbishopric of Pisa|Archbishop of Pisa]], who was [[Papal legate]], and [[Philip of Dreux]], [[Bishop of Beauvais-Noyons-Senlis#Bishops of Beauvais|Bishop of Beauvais]]. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since his brother had been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had been divorced by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged by the arrival of [[Richard I of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] on the [[Third Crusade]]: Richard supported Guy, as a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin.\n\nBalian and Maria's role in Isabella's divorce and their support for Conrad as king earned them the bitter hatred of Richard and his supporters. [[Ambroise]], who wrote a poetic account of the crusade, called Balian \"more false than a goblin\" and said he \"should be hunted with dogs\". The anonymous author of the ''[[Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi]]'' wrote that Balian was a member of a \"council of consummate iniquity\" around Conrad, accused him of taking Conrad's bribes, and said of Maria and Balian as a couple:\n:''Steeped in Greek filth from the cradle, she had a husband whose morals matched her own: he was cruel, she was godless; he was fickle, she was pliable; he was faithless, she was fraudulent.''\n\nOn 28 April 1192, only days after his kingship was confirmed by election, Conrad was [[assassination|assassinated]] in Tyre. It is said that one of the two [[Assassination|assassins]] responsible had entered Balian's household in Tyre some months previously, pretending to be a servant, in order to stalk his victim; the other may have similarly infiltrated Reginald of Sidon's or Conrad's own household. Richard was widely suspected of involvement in the murder. Isabella, who was expecting her first child ([[Maria of Montferrat]]), married [[Henry II of Champagne]] only a week later.\n\nBalian became one of Henry's advisors, and later that year (along with William of Tiberias), he commanded the rearguard of Richard's army at the [[Battle of Jaffa (1192)|Battle of Jaffa]] of 1192.   Later, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Jaffa]] in 1192 between Richard and Saladin, essentially ending the crusade. Under this treaty, Ibelin remained under Saladin's control, but many sites along the coast which had been reconquered during the crusade were allowed to remain in Christian hands. After Richard departed, Saladin compensated Balian with the castle of [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Lordship of Caymont|Caymont]] and five other nearby sites, all outside Acre.\n\n==Legacy==\nBalian died in 1193, in his early fifties. With [[Maria Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Maria Komnene]] he had four children:\n* [[Helvis of Ibelin]], who married (1) [[Reginald of Sidon]]; (2) [[Guy de Montfort, Lord of Sidon|Guy of Montfort]].\n* [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]], [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Lord of Beirut]] and [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]], and regent for his niece [[Maria of Montferrat|Maria of Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem]]. He married (1) Helvis of Nephin; (2) [[Melisende of Arsuf]].\n* Margaret, who married (1) [[Hugh II of Saint Omer]] (stepson of Raymond III of Tripoli); (2) Walter of C\u00e6sarea.\n* [[Philip of Ibelin (1180\u20131227)|Philip of Ibelin]], Regent of [[Cyprus]], who married Alice of Montb\u00e9liard, and sired [[John of Ibelin, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]]\n\nBalian's [[squire]] [[Ernoul]], who was with him on the embassy to Tripoli in 1187, wrote parts of the [[Old French language|Old French]] continuation of the [[Latin]] chronicle of [[William of Tyre]] (William had died in 1186, before the fall of Jerusalem). Although this family of manuscripts now often bears his name, his account only survives in fragments within it, mainly for the period 1186\u201388, with a heavy bias in favour of the Ibelin family.\n\n''Balian'' became a common name in the Ibelin family in the 13th century. Balian, lord of Beirut, son of John and grandson of the above Balian, succeeded his father as lord of Beirut in 1236. Balian of Beirut's brother, also named John, had a son named Balian; this Balian was lord of [[Arsuf]] and married [[Plaisance of Antioch]].\n\nThe name also passed into the family of the Greniers of Sidon, since Balian's daughter Helvis and Reginald of Sidon named their son Balian.\n\n==Balian in Fiction and Games==\nOne notable mention of Balian can be found in the 1904 novel ''[[The Brethren (Haggard novel)|The Brethren]]'' by [[H. Rider Haggard]], in which he was portrayed as the defender of Jerusalem in a not so historically accurate scenario.\n\nBalian appears in [[Ronald Welch]]'s children's novel ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' (1954) as a fat, middle-aged baron.\n\nHe is a sympathetic major character in British author [[Graham Shelby]]'s two novels of [[Outremer]], ''The Knights of Dark Renown'' (1969) and its sequel ''The Kings of Vain Intent'' (1970). However, the first is based on now-outdated research. In the sequel, Balian and Maria are depicted as manipulated by Conrad, whom Shelby (without any historical evidence) portrays as an evil sadist, and they become his enemies. Shelby even depicts Balian telling Conrad he wishes he could kill him, although all the historical evidence indicates they were close friends and allies.\n\nBalian is also portrayed in [[Alan Gordon (author)|Alan Gordon]]'s fourth work in the Fool's Guild Mysteries, ''The Widow of Jerusalem'' (2003), as the wise adviser of Conrad and Isabella.\n\nIn [[Catherine Jinks]]' book ''Pagan's Crusade'', Balian is portrayed a 'growing older' yet is admired as an efficient military commander and a sensible man.\n\nBalian d'Ibelin is the main character of a historical fiction trilogy by Helena P. Schrader, named ''Knight of Jerusalem'' (2014), ''Defender of Jerusalem'' (2015), and ''Envoy of Jerusalem'' (2016), respectively. The novels attempt to paint a more historically accurate vision of Balian.\n\nBalian also appears in [[Jan Guillou]]'s book ''[[The Knight Templar]]'', the second book in the [[Crusades trilogy]].\n\nA highly fictionalized version of Balian is the main character of the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', played by [[Orlando Bloom]] as a young man with a questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by [[Liam Neeson]]), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a [[blacksmith]] in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] (this is possibly derived from the ''Old French Continuation of William of Tyre''{{'}}s claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]], Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets [[Richard I of England]], who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.\n\n''Balian'' is also a general of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in ''[[Medieval II: Total War]], Crusade Campaign''.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus|De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum]]'', translated by [[James A.

He was [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Lordship of Ibelin|lord of Ibelin]] from 1170-1193.  As the leader of the defense of the city during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 1187, he surrendered Jerusalem to [[Saladin]] on October 2, 1187. \n\n==Early years==\n\nBalian was the youngest son of [[Barisan of Ibelin]], and brother of [[Hugh of Ibelin|Hugh]] and [[Baldwin of Ibelin|Baldwin]]. His father, a knight in the [[County of Jaffa]], had been rewarded with the [[lordship of Ibelin]] after the revolt of [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]]. Barisan married [[Helvis of Ramla]], heiress of the wealthy [[lordship of Ramla]]. Balian's name was also Barisan, but he seems to have adapted the name to the [[Old French language|Old French]] \"Balian\" c. 1175\u201376; he is sometimes known as Balian the Younger or Balian II when his father is also referred to as Balian. He is also called Balian of [[Ramla]] or Balian of [[Nablus]]. In [[Latin]] his name appears variously as Balian, Barisan, Barisanus, Balianus, Balisan, and Balisanus. Arabic sources call him ''Balian ibn Barzan'' which translates \"Balian, son of Barzan (or Barisan). His precise year of birth is unknown, but he was of the age of majority (usually 15) by 1158, when he first appears in [[charter]]s, having been described as under-age (\"''infra annos''\") in 1156.\n\nAfter the death of Balian's eldest brother Hugh c. 1169, the [[Ibelin (castle)|castle of Ibelin]] passed to the next brother, Baldwin. Baldwin, preferring to remain lord of Ramla, gave it to Balian. Balian held Ibelin as a [[vassal]] of his brother, and indirectly as a [[vavasour|rear-vassal]] of the king, from whom Baldwin held Ramla.\n\n==Succession disputes==\nBaldwin supported [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] over [[Miles of Plancy]] as regent for [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV]] in 1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the [[Battle of Montgisard]], leading the vanguard victoriously against the strongest point of the Muslim line. That year Balian also married [[Maria Komnene, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]], becoming stepfather to Amalric's younger daughter [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]]. He received the lordship of [[Nablus]], which had been a [[dower]] gift to Maria following her marriage to Amalric. In 1179, Baldwin of Ramla was captured by [[Saladin]] after the [[Battle of Jacob's Ford]], and Balian helped arrange for his ransom and release the next year; the ransom was eventually paid by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], Maria's great-uncle.\n\nIn 1183 Balian and Baldwin supported Raymond against [[Guy of Lusignan]], husband of Amalric's elder daughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] and by now regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of [[leprosy]]. The king had his 5-year-old nephew [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Montferrat]] crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, in an attempt to prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. It was Balian himself\u2014a notably tall man\u2014who carried the child Baldwin V on his shoulder at the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to [[Antioch]]. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.\n\n==Dispute between Raymond and Guy==\nBalian remained in the kingdom, as an advisor to Guy. At the end of 1186, [[Saladin]], the sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Damascus]], threatened the borders of the kingdom after Guy's ally [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], [[Lord of Oultrejordain]], had attacked a Muslim caravan. Saladin was allied with the garrison of [[Tiberias]] in the north of the kingdom, a territory held by Raymond III. Guy gathered his army at [[Nazareth]], planning to besiege Tiberias, but Balian disagreed with this, and instead suggested that Guy send an emissary to Raymond in Tripoli, hoping the two could be reconciled before Guy made a foolish attack on Saladin's larger army. The first embassy was a failure and the situation remained unchanged throughout the early months of 1187. After [[Easter]] of that year, Balian, [[Gerard of Ridefort]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]]), [[Roger de Moulins]] (Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]), [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre]] were sent on a new embassy to Tripoli. During the journey they stopped at Balian's fief of Nablus, and Balian planned to remain behind briefly while the others went ahead. On May 1, the Templars and Hospitallers were defeated by Saladin's son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah al-din|al-Afdal]] at the [[Battle of Cresson]]; Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at [[Samaria|Sebastea]] to celebrate a [[feast day]]. After reaching the castle of La F\u00e8ve, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted, and soon heard news of the disastrous battle from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem.\n\n==The Battle of Hattin==\nSince al-Afdal's army had been allowed to enter the kingdom through their alliance with Raymond, the count now regretted his actions and reconciled with Guy. Guy marched north and camped at [[Sephoria]], but insisted on marching the army across a dry and barren plain to relieve Tiberias. The army had no water and was constantly harassed by Saladin's troops, and was finally surrounded at the Horns of [[Hattin]] outside Tiberias early in July. In the [[Battle of Hattin]] that followed on July 4, Balian and [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] commanded the rearguard, but the crusader army was completely defeated. The anonymous text, ''[[De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus]]'' claims that Balian, Raymond and Reginald of Sidon fled the field in the middle of the battle, trampling \"''the Christians, the Turks and the Cross''\" in the process\u2014but this is not corroborated by other accounts, and likely reflects the author's hostility to the ''Poleins'' (a European born in the [[Levant]]).\n\nThe defeat led to a changing of the guard in Jerusalem: King Guy was taken prisoner, and nearly every town and castle soon fell to Saladin. Balian, Raymond, Reginald, and Payen of Haifa were among the few leading nobles who managed to escape to [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Raymond and Reginald soon left to attend to the defence of their own territories, and Tyre came under the leadership of [[Conrad of Montferrat]], Baldwin V's paternal uncle, who had arrived not long after Hattin. Balian was to become one of his closest allies. Leaving Tyre, Balian asked Saladin for permission to return through the lines to Jerusalem to escort his wife and their children to Tripoli. Saladin allowed this, provided that Balian leave the city and take an oath to never raise arms against him.\n\n==Defense of Jerusalem==\n[[File:BalianofIbelin1490.jpg|right|frame|Balian of Ibelin surrendering the city of [[Jerusalem]] to [[Saladin]], from ''Les Passages faits Outremer par les Fran\u00e7ais contre les Turcs et autres Sarrasins et Maures outremarins'', c. 1490.]]\nWhen Balian and his small group of knights arrived in the city, the inhabitants begged them to stay, and Balian was absolved of his oath to Saladin by [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]], who argued that the greater need of Christendom was stronger than his oath to a non-Christian. Balian was recruited to lead the defense of the city, but he found that there were under fourteen, possibly as few as two, other knights there, so he created 60 new knights from the ranks of the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es. [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Queen Sibylla]] seems to have played little part in the defence, and oaths were taken to Balian as lord. With Eraclius, he prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. Saladin indeed began the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of Jerusalem]] on September 20, 1187, after he had conquered almost all of the rest of the kingdom, including Ibelin, Nablus, Ramla, and Ascalon. The sultan felt no ill-will to Balian for breaking his oath, and arranged for an escort to accompany Maria and their children to Tripoli. As the highest ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, Balian, as [[Ibn al-Athir]] wrote, was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank \"more or less equal to that of a king.\"\n\nSaladin was able to knock down portions of the walls, but was unable to gain entrance to the city. Balian then rode out to meet with the sultan, to report to him that the defenders would rather kill each other and destroy the city than see it taken by force. After negotiations, it was decided that the city would be handed over peacefully, and that Saladin would free seven thousand men for 30,000 [[bezants]]; two women or ten children would be permitted to take the place of one man for the same price. Balian handed over the keys to the [[Tower of David]] (the citadel) on October 2. There was a 50-day period for the payment of ransoms. Those who could not pay for their freedom were forced into slavery; Saladin freed some of them, however, and allowed for an orderly march away from Jerusalem, preventing the sort of massacre that had occurred when the Crusaders captured the city in 1099. Balian and Patriarch Eraclius had offered themselves as hostages for the ransoming of the remaining Frankish citizens, but Saladin had refused. The ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns. Balian and the Patriarch led the third, which was the last to leave the city, probably around November 20. Balian joined his wife and children in [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]].\n\n==Balian as king-maker, and the Third Crusade==\nThe fall of Jerusalem, and the death of Sibylla at the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]] in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's stepdaughter Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey\u2014who had let her cause down in 1186\u2014remained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being [[Conrad of Montferrat]], who also had some claim as [[Baldwin V]]'s paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.\n\nIsabella's marriage was annulled by [[Ubaldo Lanfranchi]], [[Archbishopric of Pisa|Archbishop of Pisa]], who was [[Papal legate]], and [[Philip of Dreux]], [[Bishop of Beauvais-Noyons-Senlis#Bishops of Beauvais|Bishop of Beauvais]]. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since his brother had been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had been divorced by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged by the arrival of [[Richard I of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] on the [[Third Crusade]]: Richard supported Guy, as a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin.\n\nBalian and Maria's role in Isabella's divorce and their support for Conrad as king earned them the bitter hatred of Richard and his supporters. [[Ambroise]], who wrote a poetic account of the crusade, called Balian \"more false than a goblin\" and said he \"should be hunted with dogs\". The anonymous author of the ''[[Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi]]'' wrote that Balian was a member of a \"council of consummate iniquity\" around Conrad, accused him of taking Conrad's bribes, and said of Maria and Balian as a couple:\n:''Steeped in Greek filth from the cradle, she had a husband whose morals matched her own: he was cruel, she was godless; he was fickle, she was pliable; he was faithless, she was fraudulent.''\n\nOn 28 April 1192, only days after his kingship was confirmed by election, Conrad was [[assassination|assassinated]] in Tyre. It is said that one of the two [[Assassination|assassins]] responsible had entered Balian's household in Tyre some months previously, pretending to be a servant, in order to stalk his victim; the other may have similarly infiltrated Reginald of Sidon's or Conrad's own household. Richard was widely suspected of involvement in the murder. Isabella, who was expecting her first child ([[Maria of Montferrat]]), married [[Henry II of Champagne]] only a week later.\n\nBalian became one of Henry's advisors, and later that year (along with William of Tiberias), he commanded the rearguard of Richard's army at the [[Battle of Jaffa (1192)|Battle of Jaffa]] of 1192.   Later, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Jaffa]] in 1192 between Richard and Saladin, essentially ending the crusade.

In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by [[Liam Neeson]]), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a [[blacksmith]] in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] (this is possibly derived from the ''Old French Continuation of William of Tyre''{{'}}s claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]], Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets [[Richard I of England]], who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.\n\n''Balian'' is also a general of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in ''[[Medieval II: Total War]], Crusade Campaign''.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum Libellus|De Expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum]]'', translated by [[James A.

It was founded in 2006 by [[Mark Healey]], Alex Evans, David Smith, and Kareem Ettouney;{{Efn|name=Founders}} It was acquired by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 2010, becoming a part of [[SIE Worldwide Studios]]. The company is best-known for developing the ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' series, 2013's [[Tearaway (video game)|''Tearaway'']], and 2020's ''[[Dreams (video game)|Dreams]]'' for [[PlayStation]] consoles.\n\nBefore the company's formation, the co-founders, led by Healey, developed ''[[Rag Doll Kung Fu]]'', whilst working at [[Lionhead Studios]]. They left Lionhead in 2005 and presented an early precursor of ''[[LittleBigPlanet (2008 video game)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' to [[Sony]]. Sony was interested, so in January 2006 they secured their funding from Sony for six months and Media Molecule was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. The studio signed a deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment Europe]] in June which allowed Media Molecule to create ''LittleBigPlanet'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], with Sony owning the [[intellectual property]]. Soon after, ''[[LittleBigPlanet (2008 video game)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' started production; it was released in October 2008 to critical acclaim. Sony acquired Media Molecule for an undisclosed sum two years later.\n\nIn 2011, the developer released a sequel, ''[[LittleBigPlanet 2]]''. ''LittleBigPlanet'' spawned a [[LittleBigPlanet|series]] of games developed by other studios often in collaboration with Media Molecule. The studio has developed 2013's ''[[Tearaway (video game)|Tearaway]]'' in addition to its extended remake, ''[[Tearaway Unfolded]]''. In 2016, they opened a small studio in [[Brighton|Brighton, East Sussex]]. ''[[Dreams (video game)|Dreams]]'' was released in February 2020. The studio has won numerous awards including Studio of the Year from the [[2008 Spike Video Game Awards]]. Media Molecule's philosophy is to have as few employees as achievable.\n\n== History ==\n=== Background (2005\u20132006) ===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 450\n| image1 = Alex Evans Cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = Alex Evans\n| alt1 = A bald middle-aged man looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| image2 = Kareem Ettouney cropped 1.jpg\n| caption2 = Kareem Ettouney\n| alt2 = A middle-aged man with a ponytail looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| image3 = Mark Healey 2 Cropped 1.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Mark Healey]]\n| alt3 = A middle-aged man with a long hair looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| footer = Evans, Ettouney, Healey, and David Smith (not pictured) founded Media Molecule\n}}\nMedia Molecule was founded by four former [[Lionhead Studios]]' employees\u2014Alex Evans, Kareem Ettouney, [[Mark Healey]], and David Smith\u2014being [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on 4 January 2006.<ref name=\"Incorporation\" /><ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"Poly Tearaway\" /><ref name=\"Formation\" /> Chris Lee and Mags Hardwick are also among the founding team.<ref name=\"History\" />{{Efn|Alex Evans, Kareem Ettouney, Mark Healey, and David Smith are the principal founders of the company, while Chris Lee (entitled the \"man with the business plan\") and accountant Mags Hardwick were also part of the founding team.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"Poly Tearaway\" /><ref name=\"Formation\" /><ref name=\"IGD\" /><ref name=\"MCV\" /><ref name=\"ExclusiveDeal1\" /><ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /><ref name=\"Director\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra 2008\" /><ref name=\"LBP-F2P\" /><ref name=\"EG Expansion\" /><ref name=\"EG-Italy\" /><ref name=\"Waters 2008a\" /><ref name=\"Lewis 2011\" /> Smith stated in an interview that \"I am one of the original four or five or six [co-founders], it depends on how you count us\".<ref name=\"Guardian Interviews\" /> Some sources erroneously name Siobhan Reddy as a co-founder,<ref name=\"SMH\" /><ref name=\"Techradar\" /><ref name=\"10 year anniversary\" /> though she joined a few months after the company's incorporation.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"MCV\" />|name=Founders}} Evans and Smith are the [[technical director]]s;<ref name=\"Guardian Interviews\" /><ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /> Healey is the [[creative director]] whilst Ettouney is the [[art director]].<ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /><ref name=\"Ettouney Dreams\" />\n\nBefore the founding of Media Molecule, Evans and Healey worked at [[Bullfrog Productions]], working for its co-founder, [[Peter Molyneux]].<ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /><ref name=\"Alex Evans Interview\" /><ref name=\"Bullfrog Info\" /> Molyneux later went on to co-found [[Lionhead Studios]], with Evans and Healey being some of their first employees.<ref name=\"Bullfrog Info\" /><ref name=\"Lionhead Info\" /> Soon after, the co-founders, led primarily by Healey, developed ''[[Rag Doll Kung Fu]]'' in their spare time whilst working at Lionhead Studios.<ref name=\"IGD\" /><ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /><ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /> Healey demonstrated the game at [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC) 2005 and [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] employees were in the audience.<ref name=\"Portal2\" /><ref name=\"Valve\" /> Valve was interested in the game, they were looking for a \"low risk, low cost\" third-party game to test on [[Steam (service)|Steam]];

Everyone at Media Molecule matters.\"<ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /> Healey further noted that there are always tensions between people in development, even with two or more people,<ref name=\"Paris

employees.<ref name=\"Jobcount\" />\n\nThis philosophy has been modelled by other game developers, most notably by [[Hideo Kojima]] of [[Kojima Productions]].<ref name=\"Kojima IGN 1\" /><ref name=\"Kojima Push Square\" /> After visiting Media Molecule in 2016, when Kojima was re-establishing the company he modelled the new studio around Media Molecule, wanting \"a small, intimate type of

It was founded in 2006 by [[Mark Healey]], Alex Evans, David Smith, and Kareem Ettouney;{{Efn|name=Founders}} It was acquired by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 2010, becoming a part of [[SIE Worldwide Studios]]. The company is best-known for developing the ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' series, 2013's [[Tearaway (video game)|''Tearaway'']], and 2020's ''[[Dreams (video game)|Dreams]]'' for [[PlayStation]] consoles.\n\nBefore the company's formation, the co-founders, led by Healey, developed ''[[Rag Doll Kung Fu]]'', whilst working at [[Lionhead Studios]]. They left Lionhead in 2005 and presented an early precursor of ''[[LittleBigPlanet (2008 video game)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' to [[Sony]]. Sony was interested, so in January 2006 they secured their funding from Sony for six months and Media Molecule was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. The studio signed a deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment Europe]] in June which allowed Media Molecule to create ''LittleBigPlanet'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], with Sony owning the [[intellectual property]]. Soon after, ''[[LittleBigPlanet (2008 video game)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' started production; it was released in October 2008 to critical acclaim. Sony acquired Media Molecule for an undisclosed sum two years later.\n\nIn 2011, the developer released a sequel, ''[[LittleBigPlanet 2]]''. ''LittleBigPlanet'' spawned a [[LittleBigPlanet|series]] of games developed by other studios often in collaboration with Media Molecule. The studio has developed 2013's ''[[Tearaway (video game)|Tearaway]]'' in addition to its extended remake, ''[[Tearaway Unfolded]]''. In 2016, they opened a small studio in [[Brighton|Brighton, East Sussex]]. ''[[Dreams (video game)|Dreams]]'' was released in February 2020. The studio has won numerous awards including Studio of the Year from the [[2008 Spike Video Game Awards]]. Media Molecule's philosophy is to have as few employees as achievable.\n\n== History ==\n=== Background (2005\u20132006) ===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 450\n| image1 = Alex Evans Cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = Alex Evans\n| alt1 = A bald middle-aged man looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| image2 = Kareem Ettouney cropped 1.jpg\n| caption2 = Kareem Ettouney\n| alt2 = A middle-aged man with a ponytail looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| image3 = Mark Healey 2 Cropped 1.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Mark Healey]]\n| alt3 = A middle-aged man with a long hair looking towards something to the left of the camera\n| footer = Evans, Ettouney, Healey, and David Smith (not pictured) founded Media Molecule\n}}\nMedia Molecule was founded by four former [[Lionhead Studios]]' employees\u2014Alex Evans, Kareem Ettouney, [[Mark Healey]], and David Smith\u2014being [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on 4 January 2006.<ref name=\"Incorporation\" /><ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"Poly Tearaway\" /><ref name=\"Formation\" /> Chris Lee and Mags Hardwick are also among the founding team.<ref name=\"History\" />{{Efn|Alex Evans, Kareem Ettouney, Mark Healey, and David Smith are the principal founders of the company, while Chris Lee (entitled the \"man with the business plan\") and accountant Mags Hardwick were also part of the founding team.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"Poly Tearaway\" /><ref name=\"Formation\" /><ref name=\"IGD\" /><ref name=\"MCV\" /><ref name=\"ExclusiveDeal1\" /><ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /><ref name=\"Director\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra 2008\" /><ref name=\"LBP-F2P\" /><ref name=\"EG Expansion\" /><ref name=\"EG-Italy\" /><ref name=\"Waters 2008a\" /><ref name=\"Lewis 2011\" /> Smith stated in an interview that \"I am one of the original four or five or six [co-founders], it depends on how you count us\".<ref name=\"Guardian Interviews\" /> Some sources erroneously name Siobhan Reddy as a co-founder,<ref name=\"SMH\" /><ref name=\"Techradar\" /><ref name=\"10 year anniversary\" /> though she joined a few months after the company's incorporation.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"MCV\" />|name=Founders}} Evans and Smith are the [[technical director]]s;<ref name=\"Guardian Interviews\" /><ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /> Healey is the [[creative director]] whilst Ettouney is the [[art director]].<ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /><ref name=\"Ettouney Dreams\" />\n\nBefore the founding of Media Molecule, Evans and Healey worked at [[Bullfrog Productions]], working for its co-founder, [[Peter Molyneux]].<ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /><ref name=\"Alex Evans Interview\" /><ref name=\"Bullfrog Info\" /> Molyneux later went on to co-found [[Lionhead Studios]], with Evans and Healey being some of their first employees.<ref name=\"Bullfrog Info\" /><ref name=\"Lionhead Info\" /> Soon after, the co-founders, led primarily by Healey, developed ''[[Rag Doll Kung Fu]]'' in their spare time whilst working at Lionhead Studios.<ref name=\"IGD\" /><ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /><ref name=\"MCV Media Molecule summary\" /> Healey demonstrated the game at [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC) 2005 and [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] employees were in the audience.<ref name=\"Portal2\" /><ref name=\"Valve\" /> Valve was interested in the game, they were looking for a \"low risk, low cost\" third-party game to test on [[Steam (service)|Steam]];

In 2006, Evans stated that Media Molecule wants to stay as small as possible whilst being able to produce a [[AAA game]], aiming to keep the number employees below thirty.<ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /> Healey stated \"I am really intent on keeping us a small focused team I've had enough of working on big, bloated teams, you get too much deadwood in those situations. Everyone at Media Molecule matters.\"<ref name=\"Founders Q&A\" /> Healey further noted that there are always tensions between people in development, even with two or more people,<ref name=\"Paris GDC\" /> however, once there are a large number of people it can cause too many tensions and compared it to being in a [[soap opera]].<ref name=\"Paris GDC\" /> Media Molecule now has around 50 employees.<ref name=\"Jobcount\" />\n\nThis philosophy has been modelled by other game developers, most notably by [[Hideo Kojima]] of [[Kojima Productions]].<ref name=\"Kojima IGN 1\" /><ref name=\"Kojima Push Square\" /> After visiting Media Molecule in 2016, when Kojima was re-establishing the company he modelled the new studio around Media Molecule, wanting \"a small, intimate type of

and relaxed atmosphere comparing it to a family.<ref name=\"Kojima Push Square\" /><ref name=\"Kojima GamesRadar\" /><ref name=\"Kojima IGN 2\" /><ref name=\"Kojima MCV\" /> He set a limit of one

Teaching himself to play the guitar,<ref name=\"guitar\" /> he found that one way to get unruly pupils to take an interest in their studies was through his songs. This and performing in folk clubs led to appearances on local [[BBC]] radio programmes, which brought him to the attention of producer [[Norman Newell]]. Thackray recorded thirty songs with Newell, eleven of which were released as his debut album, ''[[The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray]]'', in 1967. Its title track exhorted his friends to mark his death with a party, and then forget him. The album also included \"Lah-Di-Dah\", in which a prospective bridegroom assures his bride he loves her so much that he will try to be nice to her dreadful family.<ref name=\"LWT\" />\n\nThis in turn led to a BBC television slot, composing a weekly topical song for [[Bernard Braden]]'s consumer magazine programme ''Braden's Week''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144656/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jake Thackray biography |website=AllMusic.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> He was not immediately popular &ndash; his first appearance in late 1968 provoked letters demanding his dismissal &ndash; but he eventually won over the audience.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Bernard |last=Braden |authorlink=Bernard Braden |url=http://www.jakethackray.com/content/view/19/32/ |title=UK sleeve notes to 'Jake's Progress' (1968) |website=jakethackray.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> After ''Braden's Week'' was cancelled in 1972, Thackray took up the same role on its successor show, ''[[That's Life!]]''.

A compilation album, ''[[The Very Best of Jake Thackray]]'', was released in 1975. His final studio album, ''[[On Again! On Again!]]'', appeared in 1977. Its title track, a long-winded tirade about women who talk too much, would see Thackray accused of misogyny,<ref name=\"hickey\" /> but the album also included \"The Hair of the Widow of Bridlington\", a song of female self-determination in the face of social disapproval. It also featured two more Brassens adaptations, \"Isabella\" (based on Brassens' \"''Marinette''\") and \"Over to Isobel\" (based on \"''Je rejoindrai ma belle''\"). The same year he published a book of lyrics, ''Jake's Progress'', illustrated by [[Bill Tidy]].<ref name=\"progress\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s he had made most of his living on the live circuit, touring in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Far East]],<ref name=\"guardian\" /> but in 1981 he returned to television with ''[[Jake Thackray and Songs]]'', a six-part series on BBC2 featuring Thackray and guests, including [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard]] and [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]] and [[Ralph McTell]], performing in a variety of venues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jakethackray.com/content/view/48/41/ |title='Jake Thackray and Songs' programme listings |website=jakethackray.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> An album of the same name, recorded live at the [[The Stables|Stables Theatre]], [[Wavendon]], [[Milton Keynes]], as part of the recordings for the TV show, followed in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jake |last=Thackray |url=http://www.jakethackray.com/content/view/24/32/ |title=Sleeve notes to 'Jake Thackray and Songs' (1983) |website=jakethackray.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> A BBC-licensed DVD of Jake Thackray and Songs was released in 2014.<ref name=le>{{Cite web |url=http://liberalengland.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/new-dvd-jake-thackray-and-songs.html |title=New DVD: Jake Thackray and Songs |website=Liberal England |date=24 November 2014}}</ref> Thackray's last release during his life was a compilation, ''[[Lah-Di-Dah]]'', released in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r921404|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of 'Lah Di Dah' |website=AllMusic.com |accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he gave up teaching for [[show business]], Thackray did not really like being what he called \"a performing dick\".<ref name=\"progress\" /> He was uncomfortable with big audiences, and favoured pubs and community halls as performance venues in preference to grander ones such as the [[London Palladium]] (although he appeared there in a [[Royal Variety Performance]]).<ref name=\"independent\" /> He became disillusioned with stage life &ndash; he is recorded as saying \"I'd never liked the stage much and I was turning into a performing man, a real Archie Rice [the hack music hall comic in [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]''], so I cancelled gigs and pulled out\"<ref name=\"guardian\" /> &ndash; and he was plagued by a self-doubt and a breakdown in confidence that Ralph McTell describes as \"catastrophic\".<ref name=\"mctell\" /> His style of work was also falling out of fashion: his literate, witty lyrics and tales of rural Yorkshire had little resonance in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] years, folk audiences had lost interest in contemporary song and, in the days of [[alternative comedy]], his bawdy humour was deemed sexist and outdated.<ref name=\"hickey\" /><ref name=\"DNB\" /> He ultimately gave up performing in the early 1990s and turned to journalism &ndash; for four years he wrote a weekly column for the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]''.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{Cite web |first=Isabel |last=Taylor |url=http://www.zyworld.com/albionmagazineonline/music4.htm |title=Jake Thackray: a Retrospective |website=Albion Music |year=2005 |accessdate=4 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and death==\nIn the 1990s Thackray withdrew to his home in [[Monmouth]], [[South Wales]]<ref name=\"guardian\" /> &ndash; where he had settled with his family in the late 1960s<ref name=\"swargus\">{{Cite news |url=http://archive.southwalesargus.co.uk/2002/12/27/69349.html |title=Satirical singer-songwriter dies at 62 |newspaper=[[South Wales Argus]] |date=27 December 2002 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815081029/http://archive.southwalesargus.co.uk/2002/12/27/69349.html |archivedate=15 August 2009}}</ref> &ndash; beset by health and financial problems: he had become an alcoholic,<ref name=\"newell\" /><ref name=\"franks\" /> and was declared bankrupt in 2000.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> He had always been an observant Roman Catholic,<ref name=\"taylor\" /> and became increasingly religious in his later years, limiting his musical activities to performing the [[Angelus]] at his local church.<ref>{{cite video |people=John Warburton (director) |date=6 October 2006 |title=Jake on the Box |medium=Television documentary |publisher=BBC4}}</ref> He died of heart failure<ref name=\"DNB\" /> on 24 December 2002 at the age of 64, leaving his widow, Sheila, from whom he was separated, and three sons, Bill, Sam and Tom.<ref name=\"times\" />\n\n==Revival in interest==\nIn May 2002 a group of fans formed the Jake Thackray Project with the intention of making more of Thackray's work available to the public.

Teaching himself to play the guitar,<ref name=\"guitar\" /> he found that one way to get unruly pupils to take an interest in their studies was through his songs. This and performing in folk clubs led to appearances on local [[BBC]] radio programmes, which brought him to the attention of producer [[Norman Newell]]. Thackray recorded thirty songs with Newell, eleven of which were released as his debut album, ''[[The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray]]'', in 1967. Its title track exhorted his friends to mark his death with a party, and then forget him.

Phil stipulates that [[Johnny Sack|Johnny]] be left out of the transaction. \n\n[[Christopher Moltisanti|Chris]] is tremulously told by his girlfriend, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti|Kelli]], that she is pregnant. He is thrilled; they get married and buy a large house.\n\nOn their way home from a trip to [[Pennsylvania]], Chris and Tony stop for a pee outside a town. They see two [[outlaw motorcycle club]] bikers stealing vintage wine from a liquor store. As the two bikers go back into the store, Chris and Tony plunder their wine. As they speed away, Chris exchanges gunfire with one of the bikers, who is wounded. Exhilarated, they celebrate at a restaurant. Chris decides to break his abstinence when Tony toasts his wedding. Later, as they drink more wine from the bottle in the parking lot, they reminisce about good and bad times, including the day when Chris told Tony about Adriana and the Feds. They say they love each other.\n\nOn a later night, during the Feast of [[Elz\u00e9ar of Sabran]], Chris pays [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Corky Caporale|Corky]] for the hit on [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Lupertazzi crime family#Rusty Millio|Rusty]], partly in [[heroin]]. Chris ends up using heroin with Corky, spending the night in a stupor.  \n\nDuring the annual Feast, Tony's crew have always managed a 5-day street festival for the benefit, [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]] says, of a non-profit foundation. But a new priest has looked into the finances and tells Paulie and [[Patsy Parisi|Patsy]] that their donation to the church should be raised from $10,000 to $50,000. When Paulie refuses to pay, he tells them they will not be permitted to display the traditional golden hat which adorns the statue of the saint. Several parishioners notice that the hat is missing, and word begins to spread that Paulie scrimped on the festival. His penny-pinching is blamed for an accident on a teacup ride that leaves several people injured. [[Little Paulie Germani|Little Paulie]] is left to deal with the police investigation. [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] and her daughter [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Domenica .22Nica.22 Baccalieri|Domenica]] are on the ride and unhurt, but Janice pretends to develop a neck injury after hearing [[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]]'s suggestion that the injured should be compensated monetarily. Janice presses [[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby]] to get the money. Threatening the ride operator, Bobby learns from him that Paulie refused to pay for a repair crew, or for newer, safer rides. In a public confrontation at the feast, Paulie refuses to compensate Bobby. Tension lingers; Tony instructs Paulie to work things out with him.\n\nAt the festival Paulie meets [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Marianucci Gualtieri|Nucci]], who says his low spending was not only wrong but sinful; Paulie swears at her and departs, leaving his adoptive mother in tears. At home, he is sleepless. Another source of stress is his fear that he has prostate cancer. Very early the next morning, at the Bada Bing where he has gone for a meeting, he sees a vision of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. A shaken Paulie visits Nucci at Green Grove that night. He sits quietly next to her on the sofa and they watch ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' together.\n\n{{wikiquote|The_Sopranos:_Season_6#The_Ride|\"The Ride\"}}\n\n==First appearance==\n* '''[[List of characters from The Sopranos \u2013 friends and family#Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti|Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti]]''': Christopher's girlfriend who also becomes his wife and is pregnant with their child.\n\n==Title reference==\n* The episode's title most directly refers to a faulty [[amusement ride]] at the feast, on which Janice, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Robert \"Bobby\" Baccalieri III|Bobby III]], and Domenica were all riding.\n* Tony spins Domenica around as in a ride.\n* The title may also refer to the ride to Pennsylvania Tony and Christopher were taking when they stole the wine and bonded.\n* It may refer to the philosophical \"thrill ride\" discussed by Tony and Dr. Melfi - something people are ready to pay their money for and actively seek to temporarily escape their mundane lives.\n\n==Production==\n* The episode includes a flashback scene of Christopher's emotional revelation to Tony that Adriana had been working for the FBI. That scene was originally shot as part of episode 5.12, \"[[Long Term Parking]]\" (directed by [[Tim Van Patten]] and photographed by Alik Sakharov), but had been cut to heighten the suspense surrounding Adriana's murder.\n* The feast depicted in the episode and named as the Feast of St. Elz\u00e9ar is based on the annual Feast of [[Gerard Majella|St. Gerard]], organized every October around [[St. Lucy's Church (Newark, New Jersey)|the church of St. Lucy's]] in the [[Seventh Avenue, Newark, New Jersey|Seventh Avenue of Newark]], a historical neighborhood of Italian-Americans, which used to be known as the First Ward. In addition to the street procession with the dollar-bill-covered statue of the saint, the feast features light shows, street decorations with colors of the Italian flag, food stands, and music (including an orchestra). [[David Chase]] said that he wanted to create an episode about the feast ever since the first season.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter=Welcome to New Jersey: A Sense of Place |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saintlucy.net/saintgerard.html |title=Saint Gerard Maiella at St. Lucy's Church website |accessdate=Oct 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060050/http://www.saintlucy.net/saintgerard.html |archivedate=October 23, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saintlucy.net/Saint%20Gerard%20Feast.htm |title=Photos from the Feast of St. Gerard at St. Lucy's Church website |accessdate=Oct 22, 2013}}</ref>\n* Actor [[Tony Sirico]], who plays Paulie, cited the final scene as probably his character's favorite thing to do with his mother as a child, going on to explain that he really has no one else who loves him, which explains Nucci's sudden change in mood and silence.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==References to prior episodes==\n* Paulie is not able to sleep and anxiously calls his doctor to learn the results of the prostate biopsy at 3 AM. In \"[[From Where to Eternity]]\" Christopher, awoken from coma, told Paulie a message from what he claimed to have been the afterlife he visited - \"three o'clock.\" Paulie disavowed the Church in that episode. This time, Paulie curses at the statue of Saint Elz\u00e9ar, refuses to pay for its hat to be carried on it during the procession and insults his adoptive mother mentioning sinful deeds until he has a disturbing vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!.\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* Christopher is watching the movie ''[[Saw II]]'' at the start of the episode.\n* During the first scene of The Feast of San Elzear, the music playing is from the opera ''[[Cavelleria Rusticana]]''.\n* Upon arriving at a house that he is looking at for a potential purchase, Christopher says, \"This is what I'm talking about, stately [[Wayne Manor]]\" (the residence of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]).\n* Following Tony and Christopher's heist of the wine (and again when Tony unloads the wine in his basement), Christopher comments that one of the bikers, with scraggly hair and a full mustache and beard, looked like \"[[James \"Grizzly\" Adams|Grizzly Adams]]\", a famed 19th Century mountaineer, later made popular as the title character in the 1977\u20131978 [[NBC]] television series ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]''.\n* The episode uses a reference to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Tony runs into Paulie in the bathroom and says \"you're doing a heck of a job there, Brownie\", a reference to a similar statement made by [[George W. Bush]] to then-[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] director [[Michael D. Brown#Hurricane Katrina|Michael Brown]]. Bush's comment is often used to sarcastically praise someone who is doing a poor job. \n* Christopher calls Tony \"The Bad Lieutenant\". The [[Bad Lieutenant|film of that name]] is a 1992 [[Abel Ferrara]] tale full of religious undertones and [[Catholic]] [[iconography]] similar to this episode. In the film, the unnamed Lieutenant sees a vision of [[Christ]] just as Paulie sees a vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!.\n* When Tony denies Christopher killed Adriana, he mentions [[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Scott Peterson]] to Carmela as examples of a lethal domestic violence case.\n\n==Music==\n* The song playing in the background at the Bada Bing! while Christopher announces his marriage is \"Flash and Crash\" by 1960s [[Seattle]] [[garage rock]] band [[Rocky & The Riddlers]].\n* The music playing while Christopher and Tony are driving and stealing wine is \"[[All Right Now]]\" by [[Great Britain|British]] rock band [[Free (band)|Free]].\n* The song briefly heard while Christopher and Tony are driving home is \"[[Midnight Rider]]\" by [[The Allman Brothers Band]].\n* The song playing throughout Christopher's high is \"The Dolphins\" by folk artist [[Fred Neil]].\n* The song played when Tony Soprano and Phil Leotardo meet at the feast is \"A Chi\" by [[Italian people|Italian]] singer [[Fausto Leali]]. The song is played again at the end of the episode when Tony and Carmela join the Baccalieris at the feast.\n* The song played when Tony Soprano lifts his niece and spins her around is \"[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Rock]]\" by [[Johnny & The Hurricanes]].\n* The polka played on accordion by [[Myron Floren]] on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' during Paulie's visit to Nucci is the [[Norway|Norwegian]] children's song \"Hompetitten\" (presented as \"Johnny Oslo Schottische\"). The music was written by Gunnar Wahlberg and originally had lyrics by [[Alf Pr\u00f8ysen]].\n* A live cover version of \"[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]\", performed by [[Johnny Thunders]], plays over the episode credits.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/index.html#/the-sopranos/episodes/6/74-the-ride/index.html \"The Ride\"] at [[HBO]]\n*{{IMDb episode|0705281|The Ride}}\n*{{tv.com episode|the-sopranos/the-ride-610262|The Ride}}\n\n{{The Sopranos}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ride, The}}\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:The Sopranos (season 6) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:The Ride (''The Sopranos'')}}\n{{Infobox Television episode\n| title = The Ride\n| series = [[The Sopranos]]\n| season = 6\n| episode = 9\n| guests= ''see below''\n| airdate = May 7, 2006\n| length = 54 minutes\n| production = 609\n| writer = [[Terence Winter]]\n| director = [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]]\n| photographer = [[Phil Abraham]]\n| episode_list = List of The Sopranos episodes\n| season_article = The Sopranos (season 6)\n| image = ep74_04.jpg\n| image_size = 300px\n| prev = [[Johnny Cakes (The Sopranos)|Johnny Cakes]]\n| next = [[Moe n' Joe]]\n}}\n\"'''The Ride'''\" is the 74th episode of the [[HBO]] original series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and the ninth of the show's sixth season.

He sits quietly next to her on the sofa and they watch ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' together.\n\n{{wikiquote|The_Sopranos:_Season_6#The_Ride|\"The Ride\"}}\n\n==First appearance==\n* '''[[List of characters from The Sopranos \u2013 friends and family#Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti|Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti]]''': Christopher's girlfriend who also becomes his wife and is pregnant with their child.\n\n==Title reference==\n* The episode's title most directly refers to a faulty [[amusement ride]] at the feast, on which Janice, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Robert \"Bobby\" Baccalieri III|Bobby III]], and Domenica were all riding.\n* Tony spins Domenica around as in a ride.\n* The title may also refer to the ride to Pennsylvania Tony and Christopher were taking when they stole the wine and bonded.\n* It may refer to the philosophical \"thrill ride\" discussed by Tony and Dr. Melfi - something people are ready to pay their money for and actively seek to temporarily escape their mundane lives.\n\n==Production==\n* The episode includes a flashback scene of Christopher's emotional revelation to Tony that Adriana had been working for the FBI. That scene was originally shot as part of episode 5.12, \"[[Long Term Parking]]\" (directed by [[Tim Van Patten]] and photographed by Alik Sakharov), but had been cut to heighten the suspense surrounding Adriana's murder.\n* The feast depicted in the episode and named as the Feast of St. Elz\u00e9ar is based on the annual Feast of [[Gerard Majella|St. Gerard]], organized every October around [[St. Lucy's Church (Newark, New Jersey)|the church of St. Lucy's]] in the [[Seventh Avenue, Newark, New Jersey|Seventh Avenue of Newark]], a historical neighborhood of Italian-Americans, which used to be known as the First Ward. In addition to the street procession with the dollar-bill-covered statue of the saint, the feast features light shows, street decorations with colors of the Italian flag, food stands, and music (including an orchestra). [[David Chase]] said that he wanted to create an episode about the feast ever since the first season.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter=Welcome to New Jersey: A Sense of Place |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saintlucy.net/saintgerard.html |title=Saint Gerard Maiella at St. Lucy's Church website |accessdate=Oct 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060050/http://www.saintlucy.net/saintgerard.html |archivedate=October 23, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saintlucy.net/Saint%20Gerard%20Feast.htm |title=Photos from the Feast of St. Gerard at St. Lucy's Church website |accessdate=Oct 22, 2013}}</ref>\n* Actor [[Tony Sirico]], who plays Paulie, cited the final scene as probably his character's favorite thing to do with his mother as a child, going on to explain that he really has no one else who loves him, which explains Nucci's sudden change in mood and silence.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==References to prior episodes==\n* Paulie is not able to sleep and anxiously calls his doctor to learn the results of the prostate biopsy at 3 AM. In \"[[From Where to Eternity]]\" Christopher, awoken from coma, told Paulie a message from what he claimed to have been the afterlife he visited - \"three o'clock.\" Paulie disavowed the Church in that episode. This time, Paulie curses at the statue of Saint Elz\u00e9ar, refuses to pay for its hat to be carried on it during the procession and insults his adoptive mother mentioning sinful deeds until he has a disturbing vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!.\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* Christopher is watching the movie ''[[Saw II]]'' at the start of the episode.\n* During the first scene of The Feast of San Elzear, the music playing is from the opera ''[[Cavelleria Rusticana]]''.\n* Upon arriving at a house that he is looking at for a potential purchase, Christopher says, \"This is what I'm talking about, stately [[Wayne Manor]]\" (the residence of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]).\n* Following Tony and Christopher's heist of the wine (and again when Tony unloads the wine in his basement), Christopher comments that one of the bikers, with scraggly hair and a full mustache and beard, looked like \"[[James \"Grizzly\" Adams|Grizzly Adams]]\", a famed 19th Century mountaineer, later made popular as the title character in the 1977\u20131978 [[NBC]] television series ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]''.\n* The episode uses a reference to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Tony runs into Paulie in the bathroom and says \"you're doing a heck of a job there, Brownie\", a reference to a similar statement made by [[George W. Bush]] to then-[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] director [[Michael D. Brown#Hurricane Katrina|Michael Brown]]. Bush's comment is often used to sarcastically praise someone who is doing a poor job. \n* Christopher calls Tony \"The Bad Lieutenant\". The [[Bad Lieutenant|film of that name]] is a 1992 [[Abel Ferrara]] tale full of religious undertones and [[Catholic]] [[iconography]] similar to this episode. In the film, the unnamed Lieutenant sees a vision of [[Christ]] just as Paulie sees a vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!.\n* When Tony denies Christopher killed Adriana, he mentions [[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Scott Peterson]] to Carmela as examples of a lethal domestic violence case.\n\n==Music==\n* The song playing in the background at the Bada Bing! while Christopher announces his marriage is \"Flash and Crash\" by 1960s [[Seattle]] [[garage rock]] band [[Rocky & The Riddlers]].\n* The music playing while Christopher and Tony are driving and stealing wine is \"[[All Right Now]]\" by [[Great Britain|British]] rock band [[Free (band)|Free]].\n* The song briefly heard while Christopher and Tony are driving home is \"[[Midnight Rider]]\" by [[The Allman Brothers Band]].\n* The song playing throughout Christopher's high is \"The Dolphins\" by folk artist [[Fred Neil]].\n* The song played when Tony Soprano and Phil Leotardo meet at the feast is \"A Chi\" by [[Italian people|Italian]] singer [[Fausto Leali]]. The song is played again at the end of the episode when Tony and Carmela join the Baccalieris at the feast.\n* The song played when Tony Soprano lifts his niece and spins her around is \"[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Rock]]\" by [[Johnny & The Hurricanes]].\n* The polka played on accordion by [[Myron Floren]] on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' during Paulie's visit to Nucci is the [[Norway|Norwegian]] children's song \"Hompetitten\" (presented as \"Johnny Oslo Schottische\"). The music was written by Gunnar Wahlberg and originally had lyrics by [[Alf Pr\u00f8ysen]].\n* A live cover version of \"[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]\", performed by [[Johnny Thunders]], plays over the episode credits.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/index.html#/the-sopranos/episodes/6/74-the-ride/index.html \"The Ride\"] at [[HBO]]\n*{{IMDb episode|0705281|The Ride}}\n*{{tv.com episode|the-sopranos/the-ride-610262|The Ride}}\n\n{{The Sopranos}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ride, The}}\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:The Sopranos (season 6) episodes]]\n", "name_user": "April 31st", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSynopsis", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ride_(The_Sopranos)"}
