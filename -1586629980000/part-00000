They are the largest linguistic group in Singapore. They come from the Minnan or [[Hoklo people]] who originated in the southern parts of the [[Fujian]] province, including [[Xiamen]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Zhangzhou]].\n\nThey speak [[Singaporean Hokkien]], the standard of which is based on the [[Amoy dialect]] of [[Xiamen]], which is partially comprehensible with [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] although less so with [[Qiongwen|Hainanese]].<ref>\"[http://www.glossika.com/en/dict/research/mutint/minnan.php Minnan]\".</ref> Hokkien Chinese was a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among coastal Chinese and was also used by other ethnic groups such as the [[Malay people|Malays]] and the [[demographics of India|Indians]] to communicate with Chinese before Mandarin came to dominance during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nJust as in [[Taiwan]], [[Hokkien people]], speakers of [[Hokkien]], refers not to people originating from all parts of Fujian. \"Hokkien\" refers only to the Minnan (Southern Min) region of southern coastal Fujian. Singaporean Hokkien does not include northern Fujianese such as those arriving from [[Fuzhou]], [[Putian]], and so on. Early Hokkien migrants settled around Amoy Street and Telok Ayer Street, forming enclaves around the [[Thian Hock Kheng Temple]]. They subsequently set up clan headquarters (''Hokkien Huey Kuan'') there and later expanded to Hokkien Street and the vicinity of China Street. The Hokkien were the most active in early trading that centred along the [[Singapore River]].\n\nAs early settlers came from the southern coast of China, they were active in sea trade and worshipped one of the patron-deities of [[Taoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], the Heavenly Mother [[Matsu (goddess)|Ma Zhu]], a protectress of sailors. In Singapore, her idol was at the Thian Hock Kheng Temple, which was thus also known as the Ma Zhor Kheng. Other popular deities are the [[Nine Emperor Gods]] and the [[Jade Emperor]], who is celebrated on his birthday on the 9th day of [[Chinese New Year]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA traditional Taoist practice by a spiritual medium (\u4e69\u7ae5, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''j\u012bt\u00f3ng'', <small>Hokkien</small> ''tangki''\uff0c\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u6b63\u5b57\uff1a\u7ae5\u4e69) is also popular. The ''tangki'' goes into a trance and purportedly channels a chosen deity for the petitioner. The deity then provides a wide range of help ranging from religious rituals to answering queries to providing protective talismans.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n;Teochew\n[[File:Teochew Building, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Ngee Ann Kongsi]] is based at the Teochew Building on Tank Road.]]\n\nThe [[Teochew people|Teochew]]-speaking group in Singapore constitutes about a fifth of the Singaporean Chinese population, making them the second largest Southern Min dialect-speaking group in Singapore. The Teochew speakers form a separate division of Hoklo (Min Nan/Hokkien) people. They originated from [[Chaoshan]] region in eastern [[Guangdong]], in cities like [[Chaozhou]], [[Jieyang]] and [[Shantou]]. Many trace their origins from different Northern cities, but were settled there to maintain as county authorities within the south of China.\n \nDespite similarities, the Teochew and Hokkien speakers consider themselves distinct and did not get along during their early settlement in Singapore, especially during the British colonial era. The Teochew were dominant for a period of time during the 19th century. Mass immigration from Fujian changed this, although the majority of the Chinese along the banks of the [[Straits of Johor]] were Teochew until the [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] initiated redevelopment in the 1980s. ''[[The Straits Times]]'' reports that [[Hougang]] still has a relatively high concentration of Teochew residents.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMost Teochew settled along the [[Singapore River]] in [[Chinatown]] during the 19th and early 20th century. Teochew who settled in Chinatown worked in many commercial sectors as well as the fisheries. Commercial sectors once dominated by Teochews include Circular Road and South Bridge Road. Other Teochew businessmen set up [[Uncaria|gambier]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] plantations in the dense forests of north Singapore and [[Johor Bahru]]. The Chinese first started their plantations with the approval of the [[Sultan of Johor]] and then developed the ''kangchu'' (\u6c5f\u539d, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''ji\u0101ngcu\u00f2'', <small>lit.</small> \"river house\") system. ''Chu'' was the clan name of the first headman of the plantations in the area. These ''kangchus'' gave rise to modern place names such as [[Choa Chu Kang]], [[Lim Chu Kang]] and [[Yio Chu Kang]], all of which were plantation areas prior to urban redevelopment.\n\nEarly Chinese immigrants clustered themselves to form clan and language associations. These clan associations (''kongsi'') served as unions for the mostly illiterate Chinese labourers and represented them when dealing with their colonial administrators or employers. One of the more prominent associations for the Teochew was the ''[[Ngee Ann Kongsi]]'', formed in 1845 and still in operation.\n\n;Cantonese\n\nThe [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] make up 15% of the Singaporean Chinese population. They originated from Hong Kong and the southern region of [[Guangdong]] province in (mainland) China, including [[Guangzhou]], [[Foshan]], [[Zhaoqing]], [[Jiangmen]], [[Maoming]] and [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]].\n\nThe Cantonese speak several dialects belonging to the [[Yue Chinese|Yue family]]. ''Yue Hai'' is considered the [[prestige dialect]] from its occurrence in [[Guangzhou]]. Other variants include ''Luoguang'', ''[[Siyi dialect|Siyi]]'' and ''Gouyeung''. The ''Gwainaam'' is spoken by immigrants from [[Guangxi]] and shares close affinity with ''[[Pinghua Chinese|Pinghua]]''.\n\nThe Cantonese worked mainly as professionals and tradesmen during the early and mid 20th centuries, and their businesses dominated the shop houses along Temple Street, Pagoda Street, and Mosque Street. Cantonese women from the [[Sanshui District|Samsui]] district worked at construction sites and contributed greatly toward Singapore's development. These [[Samsui women]] left their families behind in China and came to Singapore to work at construction sites for a living during the early 20th century. Cantonese women from the [[Siyi]] district of [[Jiangmen]] wore black headgear similar to the Samsui women and mainly worked at [[Keppel Harbour]] and the shipyards at the old harbour along the [[Singapore River]]. Many Cantonese women also worked as majie in rich people's households. More Cantonese immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nToday, the Cantonese dialect is still preserved amongst ethnic Chinese of Cantonese descent, although most younger generations tend to speak more Mandarin and English due to language reforms, but still widely used as the main lingua franca for connecting both the older and the younger generations when communicating to one another as well.\n\nAs of 2010, Singaporeans recognise [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] for having a large number of Cantonese people.\n\n;Hakka\n\n[[File:Ying Fo Fui Kun, Oct 06.JPG|thumb|[[Ying Fo Fui Kun]] is the first [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[clan]] [[Voluntary association|association]] in Singapore.]]\n\nThe [[Hakka people|Hakka]] constitute 11.4% of the Singaporean Chinese population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview Singapore|year=2006|url=http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/overview-apercu-eng.asp?iso=sg|accessdate=18 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919181532/http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/overview-apercu-eng.asp?iso=sg|archivedate=19 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They originated mainly from the northeastern part of [[Guangdong]], from such areas mostly in the villages of [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] and [[Dabu County|Dapu]] in [[Meizhou]] prefecture.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 Hakkas here and they are the fourth-largest dialect group after the Hokkiens, Teochews and Cantonese. The Hakkas are known for running pawnshops, traditional Chinese medicine shops and optical shops.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nMany Hakka women who came to Singapore during the early 20th century worked in construction sites and wore headgear similar to the Samsui women. However, unlike the Samsui, the Hakka women wore black headgear.\n\nYing He Hui Guan (\u5e94\u548c\u4f1a\u9986), a Hakka clan association, is the oldest clan association in Singapore. Its clan house is located at Telok Ayer Street in the Outram Planning Area, within the Central Area, Singapore's central business district.\n\nIn 2015 a Hakka ''[[tulou]]'' (\u571f\u697c) replica was built. The replica in Singapore was built by the Fong Yun Thai Association, an umbrella body for three Hakka clans \u2013 Char Yong (Dabu) Association, Eng Teng Association and Foong Shoon Fui Kuan. This is the only tulou replica outside of proper China till date.\n\nSingapore's founding father [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and his son, current Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] were fourth and fifth generation Singaporean Chinese of Hakka descent, respectively. Apart from Lee Kuan Yew, numerous first generation of leaders of independent Singapore were of Hakka descent, such as [[Chor Yeok Eng]], [[Hon Sui Sen]], [[Howe Yoon Chong]] and [[Yong Nyuk Lin]].\n\n;Others\n\nThis group constitutes about 5% of the Singaporean Chinese population. Of them, the majority are from [[Hainan]] and speak [[Hainanese]]. The [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]] in Singapore originated mainly from north-east part of the island, from cities such as [[Wenchang]] and [[Haikou]].\n\nAs relative late-comers to Singapore in the late 19th century, most of them worked as shop assistants, chefs, and waiters in the hospitality sector. [[Hainanese chicken rice]] became a famous dish. They were also known for their Western cooking, as many of the early Hainanese migrants worked as cooks on European ships.\n\nThe [[Hockchew]] and [[Hockchia]] originated from northeastern [[Fujian]], particularly [[Fuzhou]] city, [[Changle District]], [[Gutian county]] and [[Fuqing]]. They speak [[Eastern Min]].\n\nThe Puxian or [[Hinghwa]]s originated from Central Fujian{{spaced ndash}}[[Putian]] and [[Xianyou]]{{spaced ndash}}and speak [[Puxian Min]].\n\nTaiwan born Chinese Singaporeans are predominantly of Hokkien, Hakka or Taiwanese aborigines ethnicity. They number around 30,000 (2012) and constitutes less than 2% of Singaporean population.<ref>{{cite web | title = overseas Taiwanese population (Overseas Communities Affair Council, Republic of China)| year = 2012 | url = http://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/File/Attach/10/File_55.pdf| accessdate= 3 June 2014}}</ref> In Singapore, due to their small population, the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] are often grouped into larger populations, such as the Hokkien and Hakka, according to their dialect or ancestral origin.

The book also indicated that according to Japanese statistics of 1932, there were around 105 Taiwanese living in Malaya (including Singapore). According to verbal accounts by Singaporeans, many of the \"Japanese\" soldiers involved in the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupation of Singapore]] during World War II were in fact [[Taiwanese Imperial Japan Serviceman|Taiwanese serving in the Imperial Japanese Army]]. Similar accounts relate that many teachers of Chinese in the 1950s and 1960s came from Taiwan. After 1965, military ties led to the immigration of some Taiwanese military personnel as high-ranking officers in [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. More immigration began during the 1970s and 1980s from investors, businessmen, and students. Most of these were highly educated and employed in professions such as engineering, business, investment, research and education. Intermarriages between Chinese and Taiwanese Singaporeans often resulted in the Taiwanese partner moving to Singapore and obtaining citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaobao.com/xhd/pages/xhd090504c.shtml|title=\u4ed6\u5011\u4f86\u81ea\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5cf6\u5dbc (They come from another island)|author=\u9648\u80fd\u7aef (Chen Nengduan)|publisher=zaobao.com|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Peranakan\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|[[Peranakan]]s in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]\n\nThe [[Peranakan]] or ''Baba-Nyonya'' are early mixed Chinese-Malay immigrants from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]] who later migrated to Singapore.

A few notable Peranakans have classified themselves as a separate ethnic group and have a distinct identity from either separate group while the vast majority have self-classified as Chinese Singaporeans after re-assimilation.

Many Peranakans and Hokkien Chinese moved out of the congested town of Singapore{{spaced ndash}}today's Central Business District{{spaced ndash}}and built seaside mansions and villas along the East Coast in Tanjong Katong for their families. After Singapore's independence, Peranankan people have moved throughout the island.\n\nMany Peranankans converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] during the 17th and 18th century Dutch, Portuguese, British and Spanish colonisation of southeast Asia, which saw missionaries set up posts in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (today's [[Jakarta]]) and along the [[Malay peninsula]].\n\n;New Chinese immigrants\n\nPrior to 1990, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers from Beijing and northern China and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] speakers from Shanghai and the central Pacific coast of China constituted less than 2% of the Chinese Singaporean population. Most of the current population of native [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers immigrated to Singapore much later than the other groups, after the Singaporean government relaxed immigration laws in 1989. Because of this, the members of this third wave are called the \"New Immigrants\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u65b0|\u79fb|\u6c11}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''X\u012bny\u00edm\u00edn'').

Since the 1990s, the number of mainland Chinese who come to Singapore to study or work has steadily increased every year. Many stayed only for a short time and then returned to China, but eventually many settled down permanently and became permanent residents or citizens of Singapore.\n\nNew Immigrants tend to be highly paid white-collar workers in multinational corporations or academics in research and educational institutes. There is also an increasing number of teachers of Chinese from the PRC working in primary and secondary schools and junior colleges in Singapore.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Singaporean Mandarin|Singdarin|Singlish|Singaporean Hokkien}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Junction of Pekin Street and China Street, Singapore, photographed February 1969 \u00d7 July 1971.jpg|thumb|Bilingual signage at the junction of Pekin Street and China Street, Singapore, photographed February 1969 \u00d7 July 1971.]]\n\n;Overview\n\nTraditionally, Chinese-Singaporeans used their respective mother tongues as their main avenue of communication. Although that led to communication difficulties amongst speakers of more drastically different dialects, it has nevertheless forged strong dialectal bonds amongst the Chinese community.\n\nBut today, the speech of Chinese in Singapore exhibits a great amount of linguistic diversity and includes [[Singapore English|English]], [[Singlish]], [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Singdarin]] ([[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]]), [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]], [[Hainanese]], as well as other varieties. Most Chinese Singaporeans are generally bilingual, whereby they can speak both English and a variety of Chinese.\n\n;Before the 1980s\n\nBefore the 1980s, Singaporean Chinese were either English-educated or Chinese-educated. The English-educated Chinese were educated with English as the medium of instruction and learnt little or no Mandarin in school (in such cases, Mandarin became an optional language). As a result, they became affianced to English-speaking and inevitably distanced from the Chinese language and their respective mother tongues. On the other hand, the Chinese-educated were educated with Mandarin as the medium of instruction but learnt little or no English. They usually speak Mandarin and their respective mother tongues with little or no English. There were of course a portion of Chinese Singaporeans who were bilingual, i.e. simultaneously educated with English and Mandarin as the medium of instruction, or who attended Chinese-based primary schools and subsequently transferred to English-based schools for their secondary education.\n\n;After the 1980s\n\nAfter the 1980s, all schools (including former Chinese-based schools) in Singapore began to use English as the primary medium of instruction with Mandarin as a secondary language. Thus, Chinese Singaporeans educated in the post-80s are theoretically bilingual.\n\nEnglish is supposedly the first language and therefore presumably spoken by all residents of Singapore. This was partly due to the policy of Singapore's government to make English the medium of instruction in all schools in the 1980s (including former Chinese-based schools), as well as making English the working language for administration and business in Singapore (in short making English the [[lingua franca]] among all Singaporean). The presence of the English language in Singapore has its roots originating from Singapore's colonial past, when Singapore was a British colony. As a result of the government's policy, English or Singlish has become widespread among the residents of Singapore, including but not limited to the Chinese Singaporeans, and this especially the case among the younger generations. As of 2010, it was estimated that 32.6% of Singapore Chinese speak English at home.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\">{{cite book|format=PDF|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/C2010sr1/cop2010sr1.pdf|title=Table 4 Resident Population Aged 5 Years and Over by Language Most Frequently Spoken at Home|work=Singapore Department of Statistics, Social Statistics Section|page=26|accessdate=12 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303155259/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/C2010sr1/cop2010sr1.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2011|df=dmy}}</ref> But at work or in the city and business district, English is the official [[lingua franca]], but ironically the [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien dialect]] remains extant amongst Singaporeans, not limiting to the Chinese, and operates as an unofficial common language.\n\n[[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]] is another widely spoken language among Chinese Singaporeans. As of 2010, it was estimated that 47.7% of Chinese Singaporeans speak Mandarin at home.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\"/> Evidently, Singapore government's [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] was launched in the 1980s with the intention of making Mandarin the [[lingua franca]] among the Chinese in Singapore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iasdr2009.org/ap/Papers/Orally%20Presented%20Papers/Society%20in%20Design/Envisioning%20Chinese%20Identity%20and%20Managing%20Multiracialism%20in%20Singapore.pdf|title=Envisioning Chinese Identity and Multiracialism in Singapore|author=Leong Koon Chan|accessdate=14 February 2011}}</ref> It was intentionally a way to unify the Chinese from different dialect groups. In the 1990s, this campaign began to target the English-speaking Chinese Singaporeans. As a result of this campaign, Mandarin became widespread in places such as residential areas, neighbourhood markets and even business districts. Mandarin is also often spoken in most \"traditional Chinese-based\" schools, despite the fact that English is their medium of instruction. Colloquially, as with all other languages spoken in Singapore, the Chinese Singaporeans prefer a localised flavour in mixing words from English, [[Hokkien]], [[Malaysian language|Malay]], and some other varieties, into their Mandarin speech. Most young Chinese Singaporeans are capable of conversational Mandarin, but are weaker in their ability to write Chinese.\n\n;Variations according to age group\n\nThe linguistic diversity among Singaporean Chinese varies according to age group. Most young Singaporean Chinese speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as [[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hakka]], or [[Hainanese]]. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain upward social mobility. Many of the young Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently. This applies equally even to the more westernised Singaporean Chinese Christian community, who prefers the English language over any other.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n;Debate over preferred language\n\nThe question of which language is preferred in Singapore seem to have caused a debate among Singaporeans recently. The question of declining standards in the command of the Chinese language amongst Singaporean Chinese seems to cause several revisions in the government's education policies towards the Chinese language. The government of Singapore's continued policy towards bilingualism for all Singaporean Chinese, which is to continue to pursue English as the first language while making Mandarin the [[lingua franca]] (or at least the 2nd language or home language) amongst all Chinese has drawn mixed responses. The more English-speaking Singaporean Chinese generally prefer English as the [[lingua franca]] or their home language, while the Mandarin-speakers worry that English will replace Mandarin as the [[lingua franca]], which would eliminate the thin thread of [[Chinese identity]] altogether. With the rising economy of China in the 21st century, which has led to more Singaporean companies requiring fluency in Mandarin, Mandarin has been viewed with greater importance amongst the Singaporean Chinese than before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/16/singapore-china-idUSSIN36618920090916| title=Rpt-Feature-Eyeing China, Singapore sees Mandarin as its future|author=Reuters| accessdate=14 February 2011|date=16 September 2009}}</ref> Both English and Mandarin will continue to dominate the language scene among Singaporean Chinese.\n\n;Preservation of other Chinese varieties\n\nThere also exists a strong urge and need in preserving the many non-Mandarin topolects existing Singapore. The decline of the Chinese indigenous religion, [[Taoism]], has also indirectly contributed to the deterioration of Chinese cultural heritage. Unless the government and Singaporean Chinese take their own initiative in preserving non-Mandarin varieties, there is worry that they may disappear from Singapore in the near future. There is thus a strong desire to restore the [[Chinese identity]] or risk it falling into extinction one day. This exigency is translated into recent renewed efforts by [[Chinese clan associations]] in Singapore to impart and revive their respective Chinese mother tongues, which are met with warm receptions, including by the younger generations. Therefore, there lies a greater challenge for the Chinese community in Singapore \u2013 the preservation of the Chinese identity \u2013 than just the satisfaction of linguistic domination and material gains.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Language Most Frequently Spoken at Home Among Chinese Resident Population Aged 5 and Over.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\"/><ref name=\"howardscott.net\">{{citation| url=http://www.howardscott.net/4/Swatow_A_Colonial_Heritage/Files/Documentation/Lee%20Eu%20Fah.pdf| work=Singapore Department of Statistics, Social Statistics Section| title=Profile of the Singapore Chinese Dialects| author=Lee, Edmund E.

These schools predominantly used various southern Chinese varieties (such as [[Hokkien]]) as its medium to teach [[Chinese classics]]. In the 1920s, as influenced by China's [[New Cultural Movement]], many [[Chinese schools]] in Singapore began to change its medium of instruction to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. During the British colonial times, the colonial government generally allowed the Chinese community in Singapore to organise and develop its own system of Chinese education. By the 1930s and 1940s, with donations and fundings from the public, more Chinese organisations began to set up more Chinese schools. In 1953, the chairman of [[Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan]], Mr.[[Tan Lark Sye]] organised and helped to establish the first overseas Chinese-medium university ([[Nanyang University]]) in Singapore, leading to the establishing of a well-structured Chinese-medium education system (from primary school to university) in Singapore.\n\nHowever, after the 1960s, the left-wing communist ideology of People's Republic of China and the [[cultural revolution]] was in conflict with the capitalist policy of Singapore. To attract western investments, Singapore decided to adopt the fundamental policy of making English its main [[lingua franca]] and working language. To prevent the Singaporean Chinese from being influenced by left-wing political thoughts, Singapore greatly promoted English and placed less emphasis on Chinese education. On the one hand, it encouraged Chinese Singaporeans to attend English-medium schools for economic reasons; on the other hand, it initiated a public effort in denouncing communism. Due to a lesser proficiency in English, Chinese-educated Singaporeans often encountered difficulties in finding jobs in Singapore. Thus, the majority of Chinese Singaporeans sent their children to English-medium schools for better job prospects, causing the number of registered students at Chinese-medium schools to drop annually. All these factors (including that of government policy) eventually caused the Chinese-medium education system to perish in Singapore.\n\n{{Main|Education in Singapore|Special Assistance Plan}}\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Singapore government gradually abolished the Chinese-medium education system in Singapore. Apart from Chinese language and moral education subjects, all subjects are taught in English. However, to make sure that Singaporean Chinese still maintain and preserve their mother tongue (Chinese) culture, the Singapore government implemented the teaching of Chinese language in all schools: All Chinese Singaporeans had to learn [[Mandarin Chinese]] as a \"second language\". Singapore also established the [[Special Assistance Plan|Special Assistance Plan Schools]]. These were formerly traditional Chinese-medium schools and were tasked with the nurturing of Chinese language and cultural talents. The Chinese subject in Singapore did not just involve the teaching of Chinese; it was also tasked with the mission of transmitting [[Chinese Culture|Chinese cultural]] values to Chinese Singaporeans. Because of the continuation of Chinese education in Singapore, the Chinese Singaporeans are generally able to speak, read, and write Mandarin Chinese. Chinese Singaporeans are thus one of the few [[overseas Chinese]] communities (the other being [[Malaysian Chinese]]) which still preserved the Chinese language and [[Chinese Culture|culture]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{Main|Chinese culture|Culture of Singapore}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\nSince most Singaporean Chinese trace their ancestral origins to southern China, their culture generally has a closer affinity with southern Chinese culture (predominantly that of [[Fujian]], Guangdong and [[Hainan]]) This is especially true in terms of various southern Chinese dialects, customs, cultural, and religious practices in Singapore.\n\nAlthough Singaporean culture is diverse in nature, Singapore is one of the few countries outside [[Greater China]] with a vibrant Chinese-speaking presence. On one glance, Singapore's infrastructure and environment might seem Western, but on closer observation, certain aspects of Chinese culture is generally present across all corners of Singapore. This includes the widespread use of different [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], various Chinese writings across Singapore, various Chinese press and entertainment media, a thriving Chinese pop culture, various Chinese organisations, Chinese cultural festivals, Chinese opera, Chinese religious activities, Chinese bookshops etc.\n\n===Values===\n\nChinese colonists and immigrants to Singapore brought many of their ideas and values with them. Although they were influenced by western culture, many continue to uphold southern Chinese values such as [[Confucian]] respect for elders, [[filial piety]], [[meritocracy]], emphasis on education, courtesy etc. The Chinese taught in Singapore was also critical in propagating traditional Chinese values such as [[filial piety]], respect and care for elders, social harmony and meritocracy etc. to the Chinese Singaporean.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Thian Hock Keng Temple 14, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Thian Hock Keng]] temple courtyard and front of main temple]]\n\n===Linguistics influence===\n\nMandarin and other Chinese varieties are spoken by the Chinese Singaporeans. They influence the way other Non-Chinese languages are spoken in Singapore. For instance, [[Singlish]] is known to be greatly influenced by [[Singaporean Hokkien]] and [[Singaporean Mandarin]] in terms of grammar, syntax and lexicon.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Singaporean Chinese religion}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion of Chinese Singaporeans (2015)<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2015\">Statistics Singapore: [http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content 2015 General Household Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505143054/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content |date=5 May 2017 }}.

In Singapore, [[Chinese folk religion]]s such as ancestor worship and praying to certain deities are often classified under Taoism.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010 religion\"/>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Chinese cuisine|Cuisine of Singapore}}\nMany Singaporean Chinese dishes were adapted by early Chinese immigrants to suit local circumstances (such as available ingredients) and cannot strictly be considered mainstream [[Chinese cuisine]]. Nevertheless, these dishes exhibited local Singaporean Chinese flavours and tastes. Most local Singaporean Chinese dishes such as [[Bak kut teh]], [[Mee pok]], [[Ban mian]], [[Char kway teow]], [[Chee cheong fun]], [[Hokkien mee]], [[Hainanese chicken rice]], [[Wan ton mee]], and [[Popiah]] can still be easily found in food centres throughout Singapore. Some Singaporean Chinese are vegetarians, as they may be devoted followers of [[Buddhism]]. With the influx of new migrants from all parts of China in the 21st century, Chinese cuisine of a variety of regional flavours and tastes can be found across Chinese restaurants in [[Chinatown, Singapore]] or in other regions of Singapore, such as [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuanese cuisine]], northeastern Chinese cuisine etc.\n\n===Chinese-language media===\nIn [[Singapore]], [[Mandarin Chinese]] is generally propagated through various [[Mandarin Chinese]] national [[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television|television broadcast terrestrial]] [[media (communication)|media station]] ([[MediaCorp TV Channel 8]] and [[MediaCorp TV Channel U]]), [[cable television]] ([[StarHub TV]] and [[Singtel TV]]) and [[radio channel]]s (including [[Capital 95.8FM|MediaCorp Radio Capital 95.8FM]]). Most media in other [[China|Chinese]] varieties (such as those of [[Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese]]) are [[general]]ly [[Censorship|censored]] in the mainstream [[Chinese language|Chinese]] media of [[Singapore]], except for some [[broadcasting]] on [[Mediacorp Channel 8|Channel 8]] and [[Mediacorp OKTO|Okto]] (Such as Soap opera and government-funded mini Chinese dialect show that caters for older generation), and in [[radio channel]] [[Capital 95.8FM]]. [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] media from [[Taiwan]] and [[Cantonese]] media from [[Hong Kong]] are however easily available for sale in [[Retail shop|shop]]s of [[Singapore]] and also present in [[Karaoke]] [[Bar (establishment)|lounges]]. Some [[cable television|cable television channels]] in [[Singapore]] (e.g. [[StarHub TV]]) also have begun to have [[Chinese language|Chinese]] media from [[China]] (e.g. [[CCTV-4|CCTV-4 Chinese International Channel (Asia)]]) and [[Cantonese]] media from [[Hong Kong]] (e.g. [[TVB Jade#Singapore, Australia and Indonesia|TVB Jade Satellite Channel (Southeast Asia)]]).\n\n;Chinese press\nThe major [[Chinese-language]] [[newspaper]] in Singapore is ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u65e9\u62a5), which was formed by a merger of two of the country's oldest Chinese-language newspaper. ''Lianhe Zaobao'' was critical in maintaining the [[China|Chinese]] literary scene in [[Singapore]]. In addition to this are other [[newspaper]]s such as ''[[Lianhe Zaobao Sunday]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u65e9\u5831\u661f\u671f\u65e5), ''[[Lianhe Wanbao]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u665a\u5831), ''[[Shin Min Daily News]]'' (\u65b0\u660e\u65e5\u5831), ''[[My Paper]]'' (\u6211\u5831) (prints in both English and Mandarin), ''[[zbCOMMA]]'' (\u65e9\u62a5\u9017\u53f7), ''Thumbs Up'' (\u5927\u62c7\u6307) and ''[[Thumbs Up Junior]]'' (\u5c0f\u62c7\u6307).\n\n===Literature in Chinese===\n\nSingapore has a thriving literary scene in Chinese. The [[Singapore Association of Writers]] (\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u4f5c\u5bb6\u534f\u4f1a) regularly publish [[Singapore Chinese Literature Journal]] (\u65b0\u534e\u6587\u5b66), an anthology of literary works by Chinese Singaporeans. A number of writers (or poets) including [[You Jin]] (\u5c24\u4eca), [[Wang Runhua]] (\u738b\u6da6\u534e), [[Liu Duanjin]] (\u5218\u745e\u91d1), [[Rongzi]] (\u84c9\u5b50) etc. had contributed to the Singapore Chinese literary scene.\n\nThe Singapore Chinese literature reflected the immigration and social-historical changes of Singapore. Singapore Chinese literature had its roots from Malaysian Chinese literature, as Singapore was part of Malaya before independence. Early Chinese immigrants started off with the establishment of Chinese schools and Chinese press and as such began to create works of literature.\n\nEarly Chinese literary magazines such as ''New Citizens'' (\u65b0\u570b\u6c11\u96dc\u5fd7), ''Southern Wind'' (\u5357\u98a8), and ''Singapore Light'' (\u661f\u5149) in Singapore portrayed the lifestyle of immigrants in the pre-war period.\n\nDuring the 1950s, most of the writers in Singapore had literary works portraying the lifestyle of all social spheres of Singapore. These literary works contain large use of local Chinese slang, creating unique localised literary works. The active writers at that time include [[Miao Xiu]] (\u82d7\u79c0), [[Yaozhi]] (\u59da\u7d2b), [[Zhaorong (Singapore)|Zhaorong]] (\u8d75\u620e) and [[Shushu]] (\u7d6e\u7d6e).\n\nAfter Singapore's independence in 1965, the Chinese literature in Singapore began to separate from the Malaysia Chinese literature and continued to develop on its own.\n\n===Festivals===\n\nTraditional Chinese festivals are celebrated in Singapore including [[Chinese New Year]], [[Mooncake Festival]], [[Qingming Festival]] (also known as Tomb Sweeping Festival). Certain traditional Chinese festivals are made public holiday of Singapore, such as [[Chinese New Year]]. There existed some differences in the Singapore Chinese festival customs as compared to that from mainland China and Taiwan. For instance, it was common to carry lantern during mooncake festivals, but mainland China and Taiwan only practised the carrying of lantern on 15 January lunar calendar.\n\n===Pop music===\nSingapore features a thriving Chinese pop music scene and are known for producing Mandopop artists such as [[JJ Lin]], [[Stefanie Sun]], [[Tanya Chua]] etc. Singapore is also known for holding Chinese music concerts and festivals, including the Taiwanese-originated Spring Wave Singapore Music Festival in 2013.\n\n===Cultural comparison===\n\nThere exists, however, some degree of differences between the Singaporean Chinese and mainland Chinese in terms of mindset, culture, and languages. While mainland Chinese are largely Sino-centric in their outlook of the world, Singaporean Chinese are educated in English medium schools (but also are taught the Chinese language) and are exposed to western influences due to its long history as a British constituent colony of the [[Straits Settlements]]. As such, the local Singaporean Chinese culture is a blend and mix of southern Chinese culture, local Singaporean culture (with various influences from cultures of other ethnicity) and western culture.\n\nThere are also some differences in the Singaporean Chinese culture compared to that of China. Some traditional Chinese religious and folks custom are preserved by the Chinese community in Singapore, but are no longer practised or seen in China after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. This is especially true of regional rites and rituals practised by Singaporean descendants of immigrants from southern China.\n\nThere are also distinctive recognisable differences between the [[Singaporean Mandarin]] and [[Standard Mandarin|mainland Chinese Mandarin]] accents. Colloquially, many Singaporean Chinese also speak a creole of [[Singlish]] and [[Singdarin]] or [[Code switching|code switch]] between English and Mandarin or a dialect.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Code-switching in the Classroom: A Taboo Norm|url=http://singteach.nie.edu.sg/issue09-ideas01/|publisher=[[National Institute of Education]]|journal=SingTeach|issue=9|date=October 2007|first1=Goh|last1=Hock Huan|first2=Zhao|last2=Chunsheng}}</ref> Many of the local Chinese dialects in Singapore, such as [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]], Teochew, or Cantonese, have also been largely acculturated and differ from what is spoken in China.\n\n;Relation with current Northern Chinese\nSingaporean Chinese and Mainland Northern Chinese have had a testy relationship in recent years.

After Singapore became a British trading post as part of the [[Straits Settlement]], the first batch of Chinese came from Malaysia, predominantly from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]].  Amongst these Chinese from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]], many were Peranakans or descendants of Chinese in Malaysia for several generations. Most of them were traders who could speak Chinese and Malay, though many were also English-educated and could communicate with the British. In the'' Manners and customs of the Chinese of the Straits Settlements, Singapore'', it was described that the Straits-born Chinese regarded themselves as British subjects instead of Chinese subjects; their lifestyle was more westernised.<ref>Vaughan, Jonas Daniel. \"[http://sgebooks.nl.sg/opendoc.aspx?doc=shc/nlbhb/020000022.pdf The manners and customs of the Chinese of the Straits Settlements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827024244/http://sgebooks.nl.sg/opendoc.aspx?doc=shc%2Fnlbhb%2F020000022.pdf |date=27 August 2011 }}\" .

Many also came to work in the plantations, with 11,000 migrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n227/mode/2up |editor=Wright, Arnold |editor2=Cartwright, H.A. |author=Mrs Reginald Sanderson|date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |pages=220\u2013221 }}</ref> Because of a booming commerce which required large number of labour force, Chinese [[coolie]] trade also appeared in Singapore. Indentured Chinese labourers (known as [[coolie]]) were contracted by coolie traders and brought to Singapore to work.  Because China banned the travelling of Chinese overseas before the [[Opium War]], any form of coolie trade was conducted mainly through the Portuguese-controlled [[Macau]]. Thus any form of large migration of Chinese labourers overseas in the beginning of the 19th century is quite unlikely. It was only after the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on 1842 (due to [[Opium War]]) that large migration of Chinese [[coolie]] began to appear. In 1860 under the 2nd Opium War, Chinese coolie trade became legalised and reached a high peak. The large influx of coolies into Singapore only stopped after [[William A. Pickering|William Pickering]] became the Protector of Chinese. In 1914, the coolie trade was abolished and banned in Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe large influx of Chinese to Singapore led to the establishment of a large number of Chinese associations, schools, and temples in Singapore and, within a century, the Chinese immigrant population exceeded that of the Malays. During this period, Christian [[missionaries]] from Europe began evangelising to the Asians, especially the Chinese.\n\nPeranakans or those English-educated Chinese who had descended for many generations in Singapore were typically known as \"'''Laokuh'''\" (\u8001\u5ba2 \u2013 Old Guest) or \"'''Straits Chinese'''\". Most of them paid loyalty to the [[British Empire]] and did not regard themselves as \"Huaqiao\".  From the 19th till the mid 20th century, migrants from China were known as \"'''Sinkuh'''\" (\u65b0\u5ba2 \u2013 New Guest).  Out of these Sinkuh, a majority of them were coolies, workers on steamboats etc. Some of them came to Singapore for work, in search of better living or to escape from poverty in China. However, most of Sinkuh who came mostly from [[Fujian]], Guangdong, [[Hainan]] province paid loyalty to China and regarded themselves as \"[[Overseas Chinese|Huaqiao]]\".\n\n===1937\u20131945 (World War II)===\n[[File:Lim Bo Seng Memorial, Aug 06.JPG|thumb|The Lim Bo Seng Memorial at [[Esplanade Park]] commemorates [[Lim Bo Seng]], a [[World War II]] anti-Japanese Resistance fighter who was based in Singapore and [[British Malaya]].]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], started in 1937, revived a perceived sense of patriotism in the local Chinese to China and soon patriotic Singaporean Chinese imposed an embargo against Japanese goods and products in Singapore. During the war, out of patriotic feelings for China, many of the immigrants returned to China to fight the Japanese, while established entrepreneurs sent economic aid or military equipment to China. After the Japanese [[Battle of Singapore|took Singapore]] in 1942, the [[Kempeitai]] tracked down many Chinese who aided the Chinese war effort against Japan. However, the Kempeitai's [[Sook Ching Operation]] was simply a massacre designed to drive fear into the local populace, so the Kempeitai simply picked out people based on accounts of masked informers, which in many cases were false accounts based on personal vendettas. The Kempetai policemen also killed about 150,000 Tamil Indians in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-real-kwai-killed-over-150-lakh-tamils/article9037199.ece | title = The real Kwai killed over 1.50 lakh Tamils | publisher = The Hindu | accessdate = Sep 21, 2016 | date = Aug 27, 2016 }}</ref> There were also active anti-Japanese resistance during the war, such as [[Force 136]], headed by [[Lim Bo Seng]].\n\n===After 1945===\n[[Race riots]] were common during the early post-war period, predominantly in the period between self-governance and independence in 1965. \nOne [[1964 race riots in Singapore|major riot]] took place during birthday celebrations in honour of [[Muhammad]], on 21 July 1964. There were records of high casualties (23 killed and 454 injured), as well as claims that the riot was politically motivated to oust the then Prime Minister ([[Lee Kuan Yew]]) and his cabinet as well as to prevent the promotion of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]] concept in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].\n\nAfter the independence of Singapore in 1965, Singapore began to foster a more racially harmonious society in Singapore. Following the construction of Singapore national identity and nationhood, the Chinese in Singapore began to change their mindset from temporary stay to permanent settlements in Singapore, thus taking roots in Singapore. Following this transformation, the Chinese in Singapore gradually began to recognise nationally as \"Singaporeans\", while racially as \"[[Huaren]]\" instead of \"[[Overseas Chinese|Huaqiao]]\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nChinese migrants from China during the late 20th century and early 21st century were generally known as \"Xinyimin \u65b0\u79fb\u6c11\" (new immigrants). They came from various parts of China.\n\n==Chinese associations or institutions in Singapore==\n\n===Historical Background===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\nWhen the Chinese migrants first arrived in Singapore in the 19th and early 20th century, they settled in an enclave such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]. They tended to group themselves according to dialectal similarity, with those from nearby Chinese regions grouping together. This led the Chinese to form 5 dialectal Cohorts (known as ''Bangqun,'' \u5e6b\u7fa4), namely the ''Hokkien Bang'', ''Teochew Bang'','' Cantonese Bang'', ''Hakka Bang'' and ''Hainanese Bang''.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, the colonial government basically adopted the approach of using \"the Chinese to govern the Chinese\". They appointed Chinese leaders to govern the Chinese community. Effectively, the Chinese community existed in a half-autonomy state. Most Chinese leaders used the Chinese civil societies (small organisations) to help govern the Chinese community and to help new Chinese immigrants settled into Singapore, including finding jobs and lodgings for them.\n\nAs most of these Chinese civil societies were involved in Chinese family religious activities such as funerals or ancestral worship, they were in fact religious-oriented. This gradually evolved into the development of [[Chinese Temple]]s or [[Chinese clan associations]] in Singapore. As time passed by, the Chinese had grown to have more achievements in the business and education in Singapore. Some rich and powerful Chinese businessmen began to establish Clubs, such as the [[Ee Ho Hean Club]] (\u6021\u548c\u8ed2) in 1895,<ref>{{cite web|author=\u4e2d\u56fd\u4fa8\u7f51 (zhonguo qiaowang)|title=\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6021\u548c\u8f69\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8(Singapore Ee Ho Hean Club)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-01/18/content_2477406.htm|accessdate=12 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202074142/http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-01/18/content_2477406.htm|archivedate=2 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Chamber of Commerce]], such as the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]], to broaden the Chinese social circle. Established in 1906, the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] was the highest body of organisation within the Chinese community in Singapore. It was responsible for fighting the rights of the Chinese in Singapore during the British colonial period. During the [[World War II]], the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] had managed to help raise funds and resources to help relieve the sufferings in war-torn China.\n\nAfter Singapore gained independence and autonomy in the 1960s, the Singapore government undertook measures to help foster racial harmony in Singapore. It encouraged various races of different languages and religious backgrounds to intermingle and to live side by side. Following the growth of Singaporean nationhood and national identity, the Chinese immigrants began to change their mindset from temporary migration to permanent settlements, thus soiling their roots in Singapore. With the strengthening of Singaporean national identity, the Chinese clans association gradually declined in terms of importance. Their role of organising and governing the Chinese community was soon taken over by the Singapore government.\n\n===Today===\nToday, all Singapore's clans associations came under the flagship of [[Singapore Federation of Chinese Clans Association]] (SFCCA). They function as the cultural role for connecting Chinese Singaporeans to their Chinese roots or Ancestral home. In addition, the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) continued to look after the interests of the Chinese business community as well as sourcing business opportunities in China. The [[Chinese Development Assistance Council]] was founded out of these two organisations (SFCCA and SCCCI) to help nurture and develop the potential of the Chinese community in contributing to the continued success of multiracial Singapore. There are also various Chinese cultural organisations such as [[Singapore Chinese Calligraphy Society]], [[Singapore Chinese Orchestra]], [[Nanyang Confucian Association]], [[Singapore Chinese Opera Institute]] etc. In addition, there are also major Chinese religious Associations such as [[Singapore Taoist Federation]], [[Singapore Buddhist Federation]] to look after the religious affairs of Chinese Singaporeans.\n\nAll these Chinese organisations continue to play an important role in the economical, cultural and religious activities of Chinese Singaporeans.\n\n==Notable Chinese Singaporeans==\n===Science and technology===\n*[[Handong Sun]], physicist currently at Nanyang Technological University and an Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society\n*[[Peng Tsu Ann]], mathematician and the first University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore, Abbreviation: NUS) graduate to obtain a PhD in mathematics.

They are the largest linguistic group in Singapore. They come from the Minnan or [[Hoklo people]] who originated in the southern parts of the [[Fujian]] province, including [[Xiamen]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Zhangzhou]].\n\nThey speak [[Singaporean Hokkien]], the standard of which is based on the [[Amoy dialect]] of [[Xiamen]], which is partially comprehensible with [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] although less so with [[Qiongwen|Hainanese]].<ref>\"[http://www.glossika.com/en/dict/research/mutint/minnan.php Minnan]\".</ref> Hokkien Chinese was a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among coastal Chinese and was also used by other ethnic groups such as the [[Malay people|Malays]] and the [[demographics of India|Indians]] to communicate with Chinese before Mandarin came to dominance during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nJust as in [[Taiwan]], [[Hokkien people]], speakers of [[Hokkien]], refers not to people originating from all parts of Fujian. \"Hokkien\" refers only to the Minnan (Southern Min) region of southern coastal Fujian. Singaporean Hokkien does not include northern Fujianese such as those arriving from [[Fuzhou]], [[Putian]], and so on. Early Hokkien migrants settled around Amoy Street and Telok Ayer Street, forming enclaves around the [[Thian Hock Kheng Temple]]. They subsequently set up clan headquarters (''Hokkien Huey Kuan'') there and later expanded to Hokkien Street and the vicinity of China Street. The Hokkien were the most active in early trading that centred along the [[Singapore River]].\n\nAs early settlers came from the southern coast of China, they were active in sea trade and worshipped one of the patron-deities of [[Taoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], the Heavenly Mother [[Matsu (goddess)|Ma Zhu]], a protectress of sailors. In Singapore, her idol was at the Thian Hock Kheng Temple, which was thus also known as the Ma Zhor Kheng. Other popular deities are the [[Nine Emperor Gods]] and the [[Jade Emperor]], who is celebrated on his birthday on the 9th day of [[Chinese New Year]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA traditional Taoist practice by a spiritual medium (\u4e69\u7ae5, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''j\u012bt\u00f3ng'', <small>Hokkien</small> ''tangki''\uff0c\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u6b63\u5b57\uff1a\u7ae5\u4e69) is also popular. The ''tangki'' goes into a trance and purportedly channels a chosen deity for the petitioner. The deity then provides a wide range of help ranging from religious rituals to answering queries to providing protective talismans.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n;Teochew\n[[File:Teochew Building, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Ngee Ann Kongsi]] is based at the Teochew Building on Tank Road.]]\n\nThe [[Teochew people|Teochew]]-speaking group in Singapore constitutes about a fifth of the Singaporean Chinese population, making them the second largest Southern Min dialect-speaking group in Singapore. The Teochew speakers form a separate division of Hoklo (Min Nan/Hokkien) people. They originated from [[Chaoshan]] region in eastern [[Guangdong]], in cities like [[Chaozhou]], [[Jieyang]] and [[Shantou]]. Many trace their origins from different Northern cities, but were settled there to maintain as county authorities within the south of China.\n \nDespite similarities, the Teochew and Hokkien speakers consider themselves distinct and did not get along during their early settlement in Singapore, especially during the British colonial era. The Teochew were dominant for a period of time during the 19th century. Mass immigration from Fujian changed this, although the majority of the Chinese along the banks of the [[Straits of Johor]] were Teochew until the [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] initiated redevelopment in the 1980s. ''[[The Straits Times]]'' reports that [[Hougang]] still has a relatively high concentration of Teochew residents.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMost Teochew settled along the [[Singapore River]] in [[Chinatown]] during the 19th and early 20th century. Teochew who settled in Chinatown worked in many commercial sectors as well as the fisheries. Commercial sectors once dominated by Teochews include Circular Road and South Bridge Road. Other Teochew businessmen set up [[Uncaria|gambier]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] plantations in the dense forests of north Singapore and [[Johor Bahru]]. The Chinese first started their plantations with the approval of the [[Sultan of Johor]] and then developed the ''kangchu'' (\u6c5f\u539d, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''ji\u0101ngcu\u00f2'', <small>lit.</small> \"river house\") system. ''Chu'' was the clan name of the first headman of the plantations in the area. These ''kangchus'' gave rise to modern place names such as [[Choa Chu Kang]], [[Lim Chu Kang]] and [[Yio Chu Kang]], all of which were plantation areas prior to urban redevelopment.\n\nEarly Chinese immigrants clustered themselves to form clan and language associations. These clan associations (''kongsi'') served as unions for the mostly illiterate Chinese labourers and represented them when dealing with their colonial administrators or employers. One of the more prominent associations for the Teochew was the ''[[Ngee Ann Kongsi]]'', formed in 1845 and still in operation.\n\n;Cantonese\n\nThe [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] make up 15% of the Singaporean Chinese population. They originated from Hong Kong and the southern region of [[Guangdong]] province in (mainland) China, including [[Guangzhou]], [[Foshan]], [[Zhaoqing]], [[Jiangmen]], [[Maoming]] and [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]].\n\nThe Cantonese speak several dialects belonging to the [[Yue Chinese|Yue family]]. ''Yue Hai'' is considered the [[prestige dialect]] from its occurrence in [[Guangzhou]]. Other variants include ''Luoguang'', ''[[Siyi dialect|Siyi]]'' and ''Gouyeung''. The ''Gwainaam'' is spoken by immigrants from [[Guangxi]] and shares close affinity with ''[[Pinghua Chinese|Pinghua]]''.\n\nThe Cantonese worked mainly as professionals and tradesmen during the early and mid 20th centuries, and their businesses dominated the shop houses along Temple Street, Pagoda Street, and Mosque Street. Cantonese women from the [[Sanshui District|Samsui]] district worked at construction sites and contributed greatly toward Singapore's development. These [[Samsui women]] left their families behind in China and came to Singapore to work at construction sites for a living during the early 20th century. Cantonese women from the [[Siyi]] district of [[Jiangmen]] wore black headgear similar to the Samsui women and mainly worked at [[Keppel Harbour]] and the shipyards at the old harbour along the [[Singapore River]]. Many Cantonese women also worked as majie in rich people's households. More Cantonese immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nToday, the Cantonese dialect is still preserved amongst ethnic Chinese of Cantonese descent, although most younger generations tend to speak more Mandarin and English due to language reforms, but still widely used as the main lingua franca for connecting both the older and the younger generations when communicating to one another as well.\n\nAs of 2010, Singaporeans recognise [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] for having a large number of Cantonese people.\n\n;Hakka\n\n[[File:Ying Fo Fui Kun, Oct 06.JPG|thumb|[[Ying Fo Fui Kun]] is the first [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[clan]] [[Voluntary association|association]] in Singapore.]]\n\nThe [[Hakka people|Hakka]] constitute 11.4% of the Singaporean Chinese population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview Singapore|year=2006|url=http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/overview-apercu-eng.asp?iso=sg|accessdate=18 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919181532/http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/overview-apercu-eng.asp?iso=sg|archivedate=19 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They originated mainly from the northeastern part of [[Guangdong]], from such areas mostly in the villages of [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] and [[Dabu County|Dapu]] in [[Meizhou]] prefecture.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 Hakkas here and they are the fourth-largest dialect group after the Hokkiens, Teochews and Cantonese. The Hakkas are known for running pawnshops, traditional Chinese medicine shops and optical shops.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nMany Hakka women who came to Singapore during the early 20th century worked in construction sites and wore headgear similar to the Samsui women. However, unlike the Samsui, the Hakka women wore black headgear.\n\nYing He Hui Guan (\u5e94\u548c\u4f1a\u9986), a Hakka clan association, is the oldest clan association in Singapore. Its clan house is located at Telok Ayer Street in the Outram Planning Area, within the Central Area, Singapore's central business district.\n\nIn 2015 a Hakka ''[[tulou]]'' (\u571f\u697c) replica was built. The replica in Singapore was built by the Fong Yun Thai Association, an umbrella body for three Hakka clans \u2013 Char Yong (Dabu) Association, Eng Teng Association and Foong Shoon Fui Kuan. This is the only tulou replica outside of proper China till date.\n\nSingapore's founding father [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and his son, current Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] were fourth and fifth generation Singaporean Chinese of Hakka descent, respectively. Apart from Lee Kuan Yew, numerous first generation of leaders of independent Singapore were of Hakka descent, such as [[Chor Yeok Eng]], [[Hon Sui Sen]], [[Howe Yoon Chong]] and [[Yong Nyuk Lin]].\n\n;Others\n\nThis group constitutes about 5% of the Singaporean Chinese population. Of them, the majority are from [[Hainan]] and speak [[Hainanese]]. The [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]] in Singapore originated mainly from north-east part of the island, from cities such as [[Wenchang]] and [[Haikou]].\n\nAs relative late-comers to Singapore in the late 19th century, most of them worked as shop assistants, chefs, and waiters in the hospitality sector. [[Hainanese chicken rice]] became a famous dish. They were also known for their Western cooking, as many of the early Hainanese migrants worked as cooks on European ships.\n\nThe [[Hockchew]] and [[Hockchia]] originated from northeastern [[Fujian]], particularly [[Fuzhou]] city, [[Changle District]], [[Gutian county]] and [[Fuqing]]. They speak [[Eastern Min]].\n\nThe Puxian or [[Hinghwa]]s originated from Central Fujian{{spaced ndash}}[[Putian]] and [[Xianyou]]{{spaced ndash}}and speak [[Puxian Min]]. \n\nTaiwan born Chinese Singaporeans are predominantly of Hokkien, Hakka or Taiwanese aborigines ethnicity.

The book also indicated that according to Japanese statistics of 1932, there were around 105 Taiwanese living in Malaya (including Singapore). According to verbal accounts by Singaporeans, many of the \"Japanese\" soldiers involved in the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupation of Singapore]] during World War II were in fact [[Taiwanese Imperial Japan Serviceman|Taiwanese serving in the Imperial Japanese Army]]. Similar accounts relate that many teachers of Chinese in the 1950s and 1960s came from Taiwan. After 1965, military ties led to the immigration of some Taiwanese military personnel as high-ranking officers in [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. More immigration began during the 1970s and 1980s from investors, businessmen, and students. Most of these were highly educated and employed in professions such as engineering, business, investment, research and education. Intermarriages between Chinese and Taiwanese Singaporeans often resulted in the Taiwanese partner moving to Singapore and obtaining citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaobao.com/xhd/pages/xhd090504c.shtml|title=\u4ed6\u5011\u4f86\u81ea\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5cf6\u5dbc (They come from another island)|author=\u9648\u80fd\u7aef (Chen Nengduan)|publisher=zaobao.com|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Peranakan\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|[[Peranakan]]s in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]\n\nThe [[Peranakan]] or ''Baba-Nyonya'' are early mixed Chinese-Malay immigrants from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]] who later migrated to Singapore.

A few notable Peranakans have classified themselves as a separate ethnic group and have a distinct identity from either separate group while the vast majority have self-classified as Chinese Singaporeans after re-assimilation.

Many Peranakans and Hokkien Chinese moved out of the congested town of Singapore{{spaced ndash}}today's Central Business District{{spaced ndash}}and built seaside mansions and villas along the East Coast in Tanjong Katong for their families. After Singapore's independence, Peranankan people have moved throughout the island.\n\nMany Peranankans converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] during the 17th and 18th century Dutch, Portuguese, British and Spanish colonisation of southeast Asia, which saw missionaries set up posts in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (today's [[Jakarta]]) and along the [[Malay peninsula]].\n\n;New Chinese immigrants\n\nPrior to 1990, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers from Beijing and northern China and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] speakers from Shanghai and the central Pacific coast of China constituted less than 2% of the Chinese Singaporean population. Most of the current population of native [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers immigrated to Singapore much later than the other groups, after the Singaporean government relaxed immigration laws in 1989. Because of this, the members of this third wave are called the \"New Immigrants\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u65b0|\u79fb|\u6c11}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''X\u012bny\u00edm\u00edn'').

Since the 1990s, the number of mainland Chinese who come to Singapore to study or work has steadily increased every year. Many stayed only for a short time and then returned to China, but eventually many settled down permanently and became permanent residents or citizens of Singapore.\n\nNew Immigrants tend to be highly paid white-collar workers in multinational corporations or academics in research and educational institutes. There is also an increasing number of teachers of Chinese from the PRC working in primary and secondary schools and junior colleges in Singapore.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Singaporean Mandarin|Singdarin|Singlish|Singaporean Hokkien}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Junction of Pekin Street and China Street, Singapore, photographed February 1969 \u00d7 July 1971.jpg|thumb|Bilingual signage at the junction of Pekin Street and China Street, Singapore, photographed February 1969 \u00d7 July 1971.]]\n\n;Overview\n\nTraditionally, Chinese-Singaporeans used their respective mother tongues as their main avenue of communication. Although that led to communication difficulties amongst speakers of more drastically different dialects, it has nevertheless forged strong dialectal bonds amongst the Chinese community.\n\nBut today, the speech of Chinese in Singapore exhibits a great amount of linguistic diversity and includes [[Singapore English|English]], [[Singlish]], [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Singdarin]] ([[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]]), [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka]], [[Hainanese]], as well as other varieties. Most Chinese Singaporeans are generally bilingual, whereby they can speak both English and a variety of Chinese.\n\n;Before the 1980s\n\nBefore the 1980s, Singaporean Chinese were either English-educated or Chinese-educated. The English-educated Chinese were educated with English as the medium of instruction and learnt little or no Mandarin in school (in such cases, Mandarin became an optional language). As a result, they became affianced to English-speaking and inevitably distanced from the Chinese language and their respective mother tongues. On the other hand, the Chinese-educated were educated with Mandarin as the medium of instruction but learnt little or no English. They usually speak Mandarin and their respective mother tongues with little or no English. There were of course a portion of Chinese Singaporeans who were bilingual, i.e. simultaneously educated with English and Mandarin as the medium of instruction, or who attended Chinese-based primary schools and subsequently transferred to English-based schools for their secondary education.\n\n;After the 1980s\n\nAfter the 1980s, all schools (including former Chinese-based schools) in Singapore began to use English as the primary medium of instruction with Mandarin as a secondary language. Thus, Chinese Singaporeans educated in the post-80s are theoretically bilingual.\n\nEnglish is supposedly the first language and therefore presumably spoken by all residents of Singapore. This was partly due to the policy of Singapore's government to make English the medium of instruction in all schools in the 1980s (including former Chinese-based schools), as well as making English the working language for administration and business in Singapore (in short making English the [[lingua franca]] among all Singaporean). The presence of the English language in Singapore has its roots originating from Singapore's colonial past, when Singapore was a British colony. As a result of the government's policy, English or Singlish has become widespread among the residents of Singapore, including but not limited to the Chinese Singaporeans, and this especially the case among the younger generations. As of 2010, it was estimated that 32.6% of Singapore Chinese speak English at home.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\">{{cite book|format=PDF|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/C2010sr1/cop2010sr1.pdf|title=Table 4 Resident Population Aged 5 Years and Over by Language Most Frequently Spoken at Home|work=Singapore Department of Statistics, Social Statistics Section|page=26|accessdate=12 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303155259/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/popn/C2010sr1/cop2010sr1.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2011|df=dmy}}</ref> But at work or in the city and business district, English is the official [[lingua franca]], but ironically the [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien dialect]] remains extant amongst Singaporeans, not limiting to the Chinese, and operates as an unofficial common language.\n\n[[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]] is another widely spoken language among Chinese Singaporeans. As of 2010, it was estimated that 47.7% of Chinese Singaporeans speak Mandarin at home.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\"/> Evidently, Singapore government's [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] was launched in the 1980s with the intention of making Mandarin the [[lingua franca]] among the Chinese in Singapore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iasdr2009.org/ap/Papers/Orally%20Presented%20Papers/Society%20in%20Design/Envisioning%20Chinese%20Identity%20and%20Managing%20Multiracialism%20in%20Singapore.pdf|title=Envisioning Chinese Identity and Multiracialism in Singapore|author=Leong Koon Chan|accessdate=14 February 2011}}</ref> It was intentionally a way to unify the Chinese from different dialect groups. In the 1990s, this campaign began to target the English-speaking Chinese Singaporeans. As a result of this campaign, Mandarin became widespread in places such as residential areas, neighbourhood markets and even business districts. Mandarin is also often spoken in most \"traditional Chinese-based\" schools, despite the fact that English is their medium of instruction. Colloquially, as with all other languages spoken in Singapore, the Chinese Singaporeans prefer a localised flavour in mixing words from English, [[Hokkien]], [[Malaysian language|Malay]], and some other varieties, into their Mandarin speech. Most young Chinese Singaporeans are capable of conversational Mandarin, but are weaker in their ability to write Chinese.\n\n;Variations according to age group\n\nThe linguistic diversity among Singaporean Chinese varies according to age group. Most young Singaporean Chinese speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as [[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hakka]], or [[Hainanese]]. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain upward social mobility. Many of the young Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently. This applies equally even to the more westernised Singaporean Chinese Christian community, who prefers the English language over any other.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n;Debate over preferred language\n\nThe question of which language is preferred in Singapore seem to have caused a debate among Singaporeans recently. The question of declining standards in the command of the Chinese language amongst Singaporean Chinese seems to cause several revisions in the government's education policies towards the Chinese language. The government of Singapore's continued policy towards bilingualism for all Singaporean Chinese, which is to continue to pursue English as the first language while making Mandarin the [[lingua franca]] (or at least the 2nd language or home language) amongst all Chinese has drawn mixed responses. The more English-speaking Singaporean Chinese generally prefer English as the [[lingua franca]] or their home language, while the Mandarin-speakers worry that English will replace Mandarin as the [[lingua franca]], which would eliminate the thin thread of [[Chinese identity]] altogether. With the rising economy of China in the 21st century, which has led to more Singaporean companies requiring fluency in Mandarin, Mandarin has been viewed with greater importance amongst the Singaporean Chinese than before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/16/singapore-china-idUSSIN36618920090916| title=Rpt-Feature-Eyeing China, Singapore sees Mandarin as its future|author=Reuters| accessdate=14 February 2011|date=16 September 2009}}</ref> Both English and Mandarin will continue to dominate the language scene among Singaporean Chinese.\n\n;Preservation of other Chinese varieties\n\nThere also exists a strong urge and need in preserving the many non-Mandarin topolects existing Singapore. The decline of the Chinese indigenous religion, [[Taoism]], has also indirectly contributed to the deterioration of Chinese cultural heritage. Unless the government and Singaporean Chinese take their own initiative in preserving non-Mandarin varieties, there is worry that they may disappear from Singapore in the near future. There is thus a strong desire to restore the [[Chinese identity]] or risk it falling into extinction one day. This exigency is translated into recent renewed efforts by [[Chinese clan associations]] in Singapore to impart and revive their respective Chinese mother tongues, which are met with warm receptions, including by the younger generations. Therefore, there lies a greater challenge for the Chinese community in Singapore \u2013 the preservation of the Chinese identity \u2013 than just the satisfaction of linguistic domination and material gains.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Language Most Frequently Spoken at Home Among Chinese Resident Population Aged 5 and Over.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010\"/><ref name=\"howardscott.net\">{{citation| url=http://www.howardscott.net/4/Swatow_A_Colonial_Heritage/Files/Documentation/Lee%20Eu%20Fah.pdf| work=Singapore Department of Statistics, Social Statistics Section| title=Profile of the Singapore Chinese Dialects| author=Lee, Edmund E.

These schools predominantly used various southern Chinese varieties (such as [[Hokkien]]) as its medium to teach [[Chinese classics]]. In the 1920s, as influenced by China's [[New Cultural Movement]], many [[Chinese schools]] in Singapore began to change its medium of instruction to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. During the British colonial times, the colonial government generally allowed the Chinese community in Singapore to organise and develop its own system of Chinese education. By the 1930s and 1940s, with donations and fundings from the public, more Chinese organisations began to set up more Chinese schools. In 1953, the chairman of [[Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan]], Mr.[[Tan Lark Sye]] organised and helped to establish the first overseas Chinese-medium university ([[Nanyang University]]) in Singapore, leading to the establishing of a well-structured Chinese-medium education system (from primary school to university) in Singapore.\n\nHowever, after the 1960s, the left-wing communist ideology of People's Republic of China and the [[cultural revolution]] was in conflict with the capitalist policy of Singapore. To attract western investments, Singapore decided to adopt the fundamental policy of making English its main [[lingua franca]] and working language. To prevent the Singaporean Chinese from being influenced by left-wing political thoughts, Singapore greatly promoted English and placed less emphasis on Chinese education. On the one hand, it encouraged Chinese Singaporeans to attend English-medium schools for economic reasons; on the other hand, it initiated a public effort in denouncing communism. Due to a lesser proficiency in English, Chinese-educated Singaporeans often encountered difficulties in finding jobs in Singapore. Thus, the majority of Chinese Singaporeans sent their children to English-medium schools for better job prospects, causing the number of registered students at Chinese-medium schools to drop annually. All these factors (including that of government policy) eventually caused the Chinese-medium education system to perish in Singapore.\n\n{{Main|Education in Singapore|Special Assistance Plan}}\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Singapore government gradually abolished the Chinese-medium education system in Singapore. Apart from Chinese language and moral education subjects, all subjects are taught in English. However, to make sure that Singaporean Chinese still maintain and preserve their mother tongue (Chinese) culture, the Singapore government implemented the teaching of Chinese language in all schools: All Chinese Singaporeans had to learn [[Mandarin Chinese]] as a \"second language\". Singapore also established the [[Special Assistance Plan|Special Assistance Plan Schools]]. These were formerly traditional Chinese-medium schools and were tasked with the nurturing of Chinese language and cultural talents. The Chinese subject in Singapore did not just involve the teaching of Chinese; it was also tasked with the mission of transmitting [[Chinese Culture|Chinese cultural]] values to Chinese Singaporeans. Because of the continuation of Chinese education in Singapore, the Chinese Singaporeans are generally able to speak, read, and write Mandarin Chinese. Chinese Singaporeans are thus one of the few [[overseas Chinese]] communities (the other being [[Malaysian Chinese]]) which still preserved the Chinese language and [[Chinese Culture|culture]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{Main|Chinese culture|Culture of Singapore}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\nSince most Singaporean Chinese trace their ancestral origins to southern China, their culture generally has a closer affinity with southern Chinese culture (predominantly that of [[Fujian]], Guangdong and [[Hainan]]) This is especially true in terms of various southern Chinese dialects, customs, cultural, and religious practices in Singapore.\n\nAlthough Singaporean culture is diverse in nature, Singapore is one of the few countries outside [[Greater China]] with a vibrant Chinese-speaking presence. On one glance, Singapore's infrastructure and environment might seem Western, but on closer observation, certain aspects of Chinese culture is generally present across all corners of Singapore. This includes the widespread use of different [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], various Chinese writings across Singapore, various Chinese press and entertainment media, a thriving Chinese pop culture, various Chinese organisations, Chinese cultural festivals, Chinese opera, Chinese religious activities, Chinese bookshops etc.\n\n===Values===\n\nChinese colonists and immigrants to Singapore brought many of their ideas and values with them. Although they were influenced by western culture, many continue to uphold southern Chinese values such as [[Confucian]] respect for elders, [[filial piety]], [[meritocracy]], emphasis on education, courtesy etc. The Chinese taught in Singapore was also critical in propagating traditional Chinese values such as [[filial piety]], respect and care for elders, social harmony and meritocracy etc. to the Chinese Singaporean.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Thian Hock Keng Temple 14, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Thian Hock Keng]] temple courtyard and front of main temple]]\n<br>\n===Linguistics influence===\n\nMandarin and other Chinese varieties are spoken by the Chinese Singaporeans. They influence the way other Non-Chinese languages are spoken in Singapore. For instance, [[Singlish]] is known to be greatly influenced by [[Singaporean Hokkien]] and [[Singaporean Mandarin]] in terms of grammar, syntax and lexicon.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Singaporean Chinese religion}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion of Chinese Singaporeans (2015)<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2015\">Statistics Singapore: [http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content 2015 General Household Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505143054/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content |date=5 May 2017 }}.

In Singapore, [[Chinese folk religion]]s such as ancestor worship and praying to certain deities are often classified under Taoism.<ref name=\"Singapore Census 2010 religion\"/>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Chinese cuisine|Cuisine of Singapore}}\nMany Singaporean Chinese dishes were adapted by early Chinese immigrants to suit local circumstances (such as available ingredients) and cannot strictly be considered mainstream [[Chinese cuisine]]. Nevertheless, these dishes exhibited local Singaporean Chinese flavours and tastes. Most local Singaporean Chinese dishes such as [[Bak kut teh]], [[Mee pok]], [[Ban mian]], [[Char kway teow]], [[Chee cheong fun]], [[Hokkien mee]], [[Hainanese chicken rice]], [[Wan ton mee]], and [[Popiah]] can still be easily found in food centres throughout Singapore. Some Singaporean Chinese are vegetarians, as they may be devoted followers of [[Buddhism]]. With the influx of new migrants from all parts of China in the 21st century, Chinese cuisine of a variety of regional flavours and tastes can be found across Chinese restaurants in [[Chinatown, Singapore]] or in other regions of Singapore, such as [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuanese cuisine]], northeastern Chinese cuisine etc.\n\n===Chinese-language media===\nIn [[Singapore]], [[Mandarin Chinese]] is generally propagated through various [[Mandarin Chinese]] national [[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television|television broadcast terrestrial]] [[media (communication)|media station]] ([[MediaCorp TV Channel 8]] and [[MediaCorp TV Channel U]]), [[cable television]] ([[StarHub TV]] and [[Singtel TV]]) and [[radio channel]]s (including [[Capital 95.8FM|MediaCorp Radio Capital 95.8FM]]). Most media in other [[China|Chinese]] varieties (such as those of [[Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese]]) are [[general]]ly [[Censorship|censored]] in the mainstream [[Chinese language|Chinese]] media of [[Singapore]], except for some [[broadcasting]] on [[Mediacorp Channel 8|Channel 8]] and [[Mediacorp OKTO|Okto]] (Such as Soap opera and government-funded mini Chinese dialect show that caters for older generation), and in [[radio channel]] [[Capital 95.8FM]]. [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] media from [[Taiwan]] and [[Cantonese]] media from [[Hong Kong]] are however easily available for sale in [[Retail shop|shop]]s of [[Singapore]] and also present in [[Karaoke]] [[Bar (establishment)|lounges]]. Some [[cable television|cable television channels]] in [[Singapore]] (e.g. [[StarHub TV]]) also have begun to have [[Chinese language|Chinese]] media from [[China]] (e.g. [[CCTV-4|CCTV-4 Chinese International Channel (Asia)]]) and [[Cantonese]] media from [[Hong Kong]] (e.g. [[TVB Jade#Singapore, Australia and Indonesia|TVB Jade Satellite Channel (Southeast Asia)]]).\n\n;Chinese press\nThe major [[Chinese-language]] [[newspaper]] in Singapore is ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u65e9\u62a5), which was formed by a merger of two of the country's oldest Chinese-language newspaper. ''Lianhe Zaobao'' was critical in maintaining the [[China|Chinese]] literary scene in [[Singapore]]. In addition to this are other [[newspaper]]s such as ''[[Lianhe Zaobao Sunday]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u65e9\u5831\u661f\u671f\u65e5), ''[[Lianhe Wanbao]]'' (\u8054\u5408\u665a\u5831), ''[[Shin Min Daily News]]'' (\u65b0\u660e\u65e5\u5831), ''[[My Paper]]'' (\u6211\u5831) (prints in both English and Mandarin), ''[[zbCOMMA]]'' (\u65e9\u62a5\u9017\u53f7), ''Thumbs Up'' (\u5927\u62c7\u6307) and ''[[Thumbs Up Junior]]'' (\u5c0f\u62c7\u6307).\n\n===Literature in Chinese===\n\nSingapore has a thriving literary scene in Chinese. The [[Singapore Association of Writers]] (\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u4f5c\u5bb6\u534f\u4f1a) regularly publish [[Singapore Chinese Literature Journal]] (\u65b0\u534e\u6587\u5b66), an anthology of literary works by Chinese Singaporeans. A number of writers (or poets) including [[You Jin]] (\u5c24\u4eca), [[Wang Runhua]] (\u738b\u6da6\u534e), [[Liu Duanjin]] (\u5218\u745e\u91d1), [[Rongzi]] (\u84c9\u5b50) etc. had contributed to the Singapore Chinese literary scene.\n\nThe Singapore Chinese literature reflected the immigration and social-historical changes of Singapore. Singapore Chinese literature had its roots from Malaysian Chinese literature, as Singapore was part of Malaya before independence. Early Chinese immigrants started off with the establishment of Chinese schools and Chinese press and as such began to create works of literature.\n\nEarly Chinese literary magazines such as ''New Citizens'' (\u65b0\u570b\u6c11\u96dc\u5fd7), ''Southern Wind'' (\u5357\u98a8), and ''Singapore Light'' (\u661f\u5149) in Singapore portrayed the lifestyle of immigrants in the pre-war period.\n\nDuring the 1950s, most of the writers in Singapore had literary works portraying the lifestyle of all social spheres of Singapore. These literary works contain large use of local Chinese slang, creating unique localised literary works. The active writers at that time include [[Miao Xiu]] (\u82d7\u79c0), [[Yaozhi]] (\u59da\u7d2b), [[Zhaorong (Singapore)|Zhaorong]] (\u8d75\u620e) and [[Shushu]] (\u7d6e\u7d6e).\n\nAfter Singapore's independence in 1965, the Chinese literature in Singapore began to separate from the Malaysia Chinese literature and continued to develop on its own.\n\n===Festivals===\n\nTraditional Chinese festivals are celebrated in Singapore including [[Chinese New Year]], [[Mooncake Festival]], [[Qingming Festival]] (also known as Tomb Sweeping Festival). Certain traditional Chinese festivals are made public holiday of Singapore, such as [[Chinese New Year]]. There existed some differences in the Singapore Chinese festival customs as compared to that from mainland China and Taiwan. For instance, it was common to carry lantern during mooncake festivals, but mainland China and Taiwan only practised the carrying of lantern on 15 January lunar calendar.\n\n===Pop music===\nSingapore features a thriving Chinese pop music scene and are known for producing Mandopop artists such as [[JJ Lin]], [[Stefanie Sun]], [[Tanya Chua]] etc. Singapore is also known for holding Chinese music concerts and festivals, including the Taiwanese-originated Spring Wave Singapore Music Festival in 2013.\n\n===Cultural comparison===\n\nThere exists, however, some degree of differences between the Singaporean Chinese and mainland Chinese in terms of mindset, culture, and languages. While mainland Chinese are largely Sino-centric in their outlook of the world, Singaporean Chinese are educated in English medium schools (but also are taught the Chinese language) and are exposed to western influences due to its long history as a British constituent colony of the [[Straits Settlements]]. As such, the local Singaporean Chinese culture is a blend and mix of southern Chinese culture, local Singaporean culture (with various influences from cultures of other ethnicity) and western culture.\n\nThere are also some differences in the Singaporean Chinese culture compared to that of China. Some traditional Chinese religious and folks custom are preserved by the Chinese community in Singapore, but are no longer practised or seen in China after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. This is especially true of regional rites and rituals practised by Singaporean descendants of immigrants from southern China.\n\nThere are also distinctive recognisable differences between the [[Singaporean Mandarin]] and [[Standard Mandarin|mainland Chinese Mandarin]] accents. Colloquially, many Singaporean Chinese also speak a creole of [[Singlish]] and [[Singdarin]] or [[Code switching|code switch]] between English and Mandarin or a dialect.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Code-switching in the Classroom: A Taboo Norm|url=http://singteach.nie.edu.sg/issue09-ideas01/|publisher=[[National Institute of Education]]|journal=SingTeach|issue=9|date=October 2007|first1=Goh|last1=Hock Huan|first2=Zhao|last2=Chunsheng}}</ref> Many of the local Chinese dialects in Singapore, such as [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]], Teochew, or Cantonese, have also been largely acculturated and differ from what is spoken in China.\n\n;Relation with current Northern Chinese\nSingaporean Chinese and Mainland Northern Chinese have had a testy relationship in recent years.

After Singapore became a British trading post as part of the [[Straits Settlement]], the first batch of Chinese came from Malaysia, predominantly from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]].  Amongst these Chinese from [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]], many were Peranakans or descendants of Chinese in Malaysia for several generations. Most of them were traders who could speak Chinese and Malay, though many were also English-educated and could communicate with the British. In the'' Manners and customs of the Chinese of the Straits Settlements, Singapore'', it was described that the Straits-born Chinese regarded themselves as British subjects instead of Chinese subjects; their lifestyle was more westernised.<ref>Vaughan, Jonas Daniel. \"[http://sgebooks.nl.sg/opendoc.aspx?doc=shc/nlbhb/020000022.pdf The manners and customs of the Chinese of the Straits Settlements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827024244/http://sgebooks.nl.sg/opendoc.aspx?doc=shc%2Fnlbhb%2F020000022.pdf |date=27 August 2011 }}\" .

Many also came to work in the plantations, with 11,000 migrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n227/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A. |author=Mrs Reginald Sanderson|date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |pages=220\u2013221 }}</ref> Because of a booming commerce which required large number of labour force, Chinese [[coolie]] trade also appeared in Singapore. Indentured Chinese labourers (known as [[coolie]]) were contracted by coolie traders and brought to Singapore to work.  Because China banned the travelling of Chinese overseas before the [[Opium War]], any form of coolie trade was conducted mainly through the Portuguese-controlled [[Macau]]. Thus any form of large migration of Chinese labourers overseas in the beginning of the 19th century is quite unlikely. It was only after the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on 1842 (due to [[Opium War]]) that large migration of Chinese [[coolie]] began to appear. In 1860 under the 2nd Opium War, Chinese coolie trade became legalised and reached a high peak. The large influx of coolies into Singapore only stopped after [[William A. Pickering|William Pickering]] became the Protector of Chinese. In 1914, the coolie trade was abolished and banned in Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe large influx of Chinese to Singapore led to the establishment of a large number of Chinese associations, schools, and temples in Singapore and, within a century, the Chinese immigrant population exceeded that of the Malays. During this period, Christian [[missionaries]] from Europe began evangelising to the Asians, especially the Chinese.\n\nPeranakans or those English-educated Chinese who had descended for many generations in Singapore were typically known as \"'''Laokuh'''\" (\u8001\u5ba2 \u2013 Old Guest) or \"'''Straits Chinese'''\". Most of them paid loyalty to the [[British Empire]] and did not regard themselves as \"Huaqiao\".  From the 19th till the mid 20th century, migrants from China were known as \"'''Sinkuh'''\" (\u65b0\u5ba2 \u2013 New Guest).  Out of these Sinkuh, a majority of them were coolies, workers on steamboats etc. Some of them came to Singapore for work, in search of better living or to escape from poverty in China. However, most of Sinkuh who came mostly from [[Fujian]], Guangdong, [[Hainan]] province paid loyalty to China and regarded themselves as \"[[Overseas Chinese|Huaqiao]]\".\n\n===1937\u20131945 (World War II)===\n[[File:Lim Bo Seng Memorial, Aug 06.JPG|thumb|The Lim Bo Seng Memorial at [[Esplanade Park]] commemorates [[Lim Bo Seng]], a [[World War II]] anti-Japanese Resistance fighter who was based in Singapore and [[British Malaya]].]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], started in 1937, revived a perceived sense of patriotism in the local Chinese to China and soon patriotic Singaporean Chinese imposed an embargo against Japanese goods and products in Singapore. During the war, out of patriotic feelings for China, many of the immigrants returned to China to fight the Japanese, while established entrepreneurs sent economic aid or military equipment to China. After the Japanese [[Battle of Singapore|took Singapore]] in 1942, the [[Kempeitai]] tracked down many Chinese who aided the Chinese war effort against Japan. However, the Kempeitai's [[Sook Ching Operation]] was simply a massacre designed to drive fear into the local populace, so the Kempeitai simply picked out people based on accounts of masked informers, which in many cases were false accounts based on personal vendettas. The Kempetai policemen also killed about 150,000 Tamil Indians in Thailand.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-real-kwai-killed-over-150-lakh-tamils/article9037199.ece | title = The real Kwai killed over 1.50 lakh Tamils | publisher = The Hindu | accessdate = Sep 21, 2016 | date = Aug 27, 2016 }}</ref> There were also active anti-Japanese resistance during the war, such as [[Force 136]], headed by [[Lim Bo Seng]].\n\n===After 1945===\n[[Race riots]] were common during the early post-war period, predominantly in the period between self-governance and independence in 1965. \nOne [[1964 race riots in Singapore|major riot]] took place during birthday celebrations in honour of [[Muhammad]], on 21 July 1964. There were records of high casualties (23 killed and 454 injured), as well as claims that the riot was politically motivated to oust the then Prime Minister ([[Lee Kuan Yew]]) and his cabinet as well as to prevent the promotion of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]] concept in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].\n\nAfter the independence of Singapore in 1965, Singapore began to foster a more racially harmonious society in Singapore. Following the construction of Singapore national identity and nationhood, the Chinese in Singapore began to change their mindset from temporary stay to permanent settlements in Singapore, thus taking roots in Singapore. Following this transformation, the Chinese in Singapore gradually began to recognise nationally as \"Singaporeans\", while racially as \"[[Huaren]]\" instead of \"[[Overseas Chinese|Huaqiao]]\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nChinese migrants from China during the late 20th century and early 21st century were generally known as \"Xinyimin \u65b0\u79fb\u6c11\" (new immigrants). They came from various parts of China.\n\n==Chinese associations or institutions in Singapore==\n\n===Historical Background===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\nWhen the Chinese migrants first arrived in Singapore in the 19th and early 20th century, they settled in an enclave such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]. They tended to group themselves according to dialectal similarity, with those from nearby Chinese regions grouping together. This led the Chinese to form 5 dialectal Cohorts (known as ''Bangqun,'' \u5e6b\u7fa4), namely the ''Hokkien Bang'', ''Teochew Bang'','' Cantonese Bang'', ''Hakka Bang'' and ''Hainanese Bang''.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, the colonial government basically adopted the approach of using \"the Chinese to govern the Chinese\". They appointed Chinese leaders to govern the Chinese community. Effectively, the Chinese community existed in a half-autonomy state. Most Chinese leaders used the Chinese civil societies (small organisations) to help govern the Chinese community and to help new Chinese immigrants settled into Singapore, including finding jobs and lodgings for them.\n\nAs most of these Chinese civil societies were involved in Chinese family religious activities such as funerals or ancestral worship, they were in fact religious-oriented. This gradually evolved into the development of [[Chinese Temple]]s or [[Chinese clan associations]] in Singapore. As time passed by, the Chinese had grown to have more achievements in the business and education in Singapore. Some rich and powerful Chinese businessmen began to establish Clubs, such as the [[Ee Ho Hean Club]] (\u6021\u548c\u8ed2) in 1895,<ref>{{cite web|author=\u4e2d\u56fd\u4fa8\u7f51 (zhonguo qiaowang)|title=\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6021\u548c\u8f69\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8(Singapore Ee Ho Hean Club)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-01/18/content_2477406.htm|accessdate=12 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202074142/http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-01/18/content_2477406.htm|archivedate=2 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Chamber of Commerce]], such as the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]], to broaden the Chinese social circle. Established in 1906, the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] was the highest body of organisation within the Chinese community in Singapore. It was responsible for fighting the rights of the Chinese in Singapore during the British colonial period. During the [[World War II]], the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] had managed to help raise funds and resources to help relieve the sufferings in war-torn China.\n\nAfter Singapore gained independence and autonomy in the 1960s, the Singapore government undertook measures to help foster racial harmony in Singapore. It encouraged various races of different languages and religious backgrounds to intermingle and to live side by side. Following the growth of Singaporean nationhood and national identity, the Chinese immigrants began to change their mindset from temporary migration to permanent settlements, thus soiling their roots in Singapore. With the strengthening of Singaporean national identity, the Chinese clans association gradually declined in terms of importance. Their role of organising and governing the Chinese community was soon taken over by the Singapore government.\n\n===Today===\nToday, all Singapore's clans associations came under the flagship of [[Singapore Federation of Chinese Clans Association]] (SFCCA). They function as the cultural role for connecting Chinese Singaporeans to their Chinese roots or Ancestral home. In addition, the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) continued to look after the interests of the Chinese business community as well as sourcing business opportunities in China. The [[Chinese Development Assistance Council]] was founded out of these two organisations (SFCCA and SCCCI) to help nurture and develop the potential of the Chinese community in contributing to the continued success of multiracial Singapore. There are also various Chinese cultural organisations such as [[Singapore Chinese Calligraphy Society]], [[Singapore Chinese Orchestra]], [[Nanyang Confucian Association]], [[Singapore Chinese Opera Institute]] etc. In addition, there are also major Chinese religious Associations such as [[Singapore Taoist Federation]], [[Singapore Buddhist Federation]] to look after the religious affairs of Chinese Singaporeans.\n\nAll these Chinese organisations continue to play an important role in the economical, cultural and religious activities of Chinese Singaporeans.\n\n==Notable Chinese Singaporeans==\n===Science and technology===\n*[[Handong Sun]], physicist currently at Nanyang Technological University and an Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society\n*[[Peng Tsu Ann]], mathematician and the first University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore, Abbreviation: NUS) graduate to obtain a PhD in mathematics.
