The Romans were commanded by [[Gaius Marius]], the Numidians by an unknown commander. The Romans main objective was to capture one of king [[Jugurtha]]'s treasuries which was reported to be inside the fortress. Marius besieged the fortress town and finally took it by trickery.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 82\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\nKing [[Masinissa]] of Numidia, who was a steadfast ally of Rome, died in 149, he was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the [[siege of Numantia]], where he had formed a friendship with Roman aristocrats and learned about Roman society and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that after his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the [[Roman Senate]] for arbitration.\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants in 116 BC. Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission and was alloted the more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Romans and Italians who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC.\n\nIn 111 BC the consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]] commanded a Roman army against Jugurtha, but he allowed himself to be bribed. The following year the consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] succeeded the command against the Numidian king, but he let himself be bribed too. Spurius's brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.\n\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, men like [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]]. Metellus arrived in Africa as consul in 109 BC and dedicated the remainder of the year to a serious disciplinary reform of his demoralised forces.\nIn spring of 108, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated. Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul where the Numidians ambushed them. Through the capable leadership of Metellus, Marius and Rutilius Rufus the Romans won an indecisive victory at the [[Battle of the Muthul]]. Later that year Metellus surprised Jugurtha by capturing the treasury fortresses at [[Siege of Thala|Thala]]. \n\nThe following year (107 BC) one of the new consuls, Gaius Marius, took over command of the war against Jugurtha. Marius marched west plundering the Numidian countryside, seizing minor Numidian towns and fortresses trying to provoke Jugurtha into a set-piece battle, but the Numidian king refused to engage. Marius destroyed the Numidian city of Capsa; after which town after town fell, most without military action. By the beginning of 106 BC, Marius had carved a path of destruction through the Numidian heartland, and subdued most of Jugurtha's kingdom in the process. He now reached one of Jugurtha's primary treasuries, which was kept in a fortress town near the River Muluccha.<ref>Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 78\u201382.</ref>\n\n==The Siege==\nMarius was determined to capture the town and its treasury, but because of the landscape and the location of fortress he was unable to employ the necessary siege engines.

Apparantly, he was in the mood for snails and went climbing to look for them. As he sought his dinner he found a way onto the plateau and into the town. He returned to the camp and reported what he had discovered. Marius assigned five horn players and four centurions to accompany the Ligurian and infiltrate the town. The Romans created a diversion to draw the defenders attention to the front so the infiltration party could enter the town via the rear. When the infiltration party was in place Marius ordered a full assault on the town. He sent a [[Testudo formation|testudo]] towards the gate.

Unfortunately for Jugurtha, Marius and his subordinate [[Sulla]] were able to convince king Bocchus, Jugurtha's ally and father-in-law, it was in his best interest to abandon his son-in-law. Bocchus conspired with Sulla, who had traveled to Mauretania on a special mission to capture Jugurtha. It was a dangerous operation from the beginning, with King Bocchus weighing up the advantages of handing Jugurtha over to Sulla or Sulla over to Jugurtha. In the end Bocchus decided his future lay with Rome and he helped capture Jugurtha.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sulla'', 3.</ref> Although Sulla had engineered the capture of Jugurtha, as Sulla was serving under Marius at the time, Marius took credit for this feat.

Island]] in the [[Aleutians East Borough, Alaska|Aleutians East Borough]] of the [[Aleutian Islands]] in [[Alaska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,027 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 713 in 2000. '''Akutan Harbor''' is adjacent.\n\n==Geography==\nAkutan is located at {{coord|54|7|57|N|165|46|30|W|type:city}}. Akutan is located in the [[Aleutian Islands]] [[Recording District (Alaska)|Recording District]].\n\nAkutan is located on [[Akutan Island]] in the eastern Aleutians, one of the [[Krenitzin Islands]] in the [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox Islands]] group. It is {{convert|35|mi}} east of [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], and {{convert|766|mi|km}} southwest of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].  Akutan lies in the [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] zone, resulting in mild winters and cool summers. Mean temperatures range from {{convert|22|to|55|F|C}}, and precipitation averages {{convert|28|inch|mm}} per year. High winds and storms are frequent in the winter, and fog is common in the summer.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|14.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi|km2}} of it (25.69%) is water.\n\n==History and culture==\n\nAkutan began in 1878 as a fur storage and trading port for the Western Fur & Trading Company. The company's agent established a commercial cod fishing and processing business that quickly attracted nearby [[Unangan]] to the community. A [[Russian Orthodox]] church and a school were built in 1878, but was replaced by the [[St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel]], built in 1918.\n\nThe Pacific Whaling Company built a whale processing station across the bay from Akutan in 1912. It was the only whaling station in the Aleutians, and operated until 1939.\n\n[[File:St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel]]]]\nAfter the Japanese attacked Unalaska in June 1942, the U.S. government evacuated Akutan residents to the Ketchikan area. In June 1942, a Japanese [[A6M Zero]] fighter piloted by Tadayoshi Koga crashed on Akutan Island. It was recovered in July by the United States Army Air Force. This plane, dubbed the [[Akutan Zero]], significantly aided American tacticians in devising [[dog fighting]] techniques to defeat the Zero, and helped change the course of the war.\n\nThe village was re-established in 1944, although many villagers chose not to return. This exposure to the outside world brought many changes to the traditional lifestyle and attitudes of the community. The City was incorporated in 1979.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Native Village of Akutan. The population of the community consists of 16.4% Alaska Native or part Native. Akutan is a fishing community, and is the site of a traditional Unangan village. Approximately 75 persons are year-round residents; the majority of the population are transient [[fish processing]] workers that live in group quarters.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Whaling station showing buildings and harbor, Akutan, Alaska, ca 1915 (COBB 79).jpeg|Whaling station along the harbor at Akutan ca. 1915\nFile:American Pacific Sea Products Co's whaler UNIMAK, Akutan Harbor, Alaska, 1914 (COBB 46).jpeg|Whaler ''Unimak'' in Akutan Harbor, 1914.

Trident Seafoods operates a large processing plant west of the City for cod, crab, pollock and fish meal. The population of Akutan can quadruple or quintuple during processing months. Seven residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for halibut and other groundfish. Subsistence foods include seal, salmon, herring, halibut, clams, wild cattle, and game birds.\n\n===Transportation===\n\nBoats and amphibious aircraft, hovercraft, or helicopter are the only means of transportation into and out of Akutan. A {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} dock and a small boat mooring basin are available. Plans are underway to develop a practical way to get to a large boat harbor that has been built at the head of the bay. The State Ferry operates from Kodiak bi-monthly between May and October. Cargo is delivered weekly by freighter from Seattle; the City owns and operates a landing craft, the M/V Akutan. Akutan has no airstrip due to the steep terrain, however, a [[Akutan Seaplane Base|seaplane base]] is available and open to the public.  Helicopter service between Akutan and [[Akun Island]], the location of [[Akutan Airport]], began in February 2014. The only airline company serving the airport is [[Grant Aviation]], flying to nearby Dutch Harbor. The airport was expected to cost $77 million of which nearly $60 million came from the U.S. federal government. Trident paid $1 million towards the cost of the airport.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/10/07/tuchman-alaska-airport.cnn Alaska's 'airport to nowhere'], CNN, Gary Tuchman, October 7,

A [[Russian Orthodox]] church and a school were built in 1878, but was replaced by the [[St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel]], built in 1918.\n\nThe Pacific Whaling Company built a whale processing station across the bay from Akutan in 1912. It was the only whaling station in the Aleutians, and operated until 1939.\n\n[[File:St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel]]]]\nAfter the Japanese attacked Unalaska in June 1942, the U.S. government evacuated Akutan residents to the Ketchikan area. In June 1942, a Japanese [[A6M Zero]] fighter piloted by Tadayoshi Koga crashed on Akutan Island. It was recovered in July by the United States Army Air Force. This plane, dubbed the [[Akutan Zero]], significantly aided American tacticians in devising [[dog fighting]] techniques to defeat the Zero, and helped change the course of the war.\n\nThe village was re-established in 1944, although many villagers chose not to return. This exposure to the outside world brought many changes to the traditional lifestyle and attitudes of the community. The City was incorporated in 1979.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Native Village of Akutan. The population of the community consists of 16.4% Alaska Native or part Native. Akutan is a fishing community, and is the site of a traditional Unangan village. Approximately 75 persons are year-round residents; the majority of the population are transient [[fish processing]] workers that live in group quarters.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Whaling station showing buildings and harbor, Akutan, Alaska, ca 1915 (COBB 79).jpeg|Whaling station along the harbor at Akutan ca. 1915\nFile:American Pacific Sea Products Co's whaler UNIMAK, Akutan Harbor, Alaska, 1914 (COBB 46).jpeg|Whaler ''Unimak'' in Akutan Harbor, 1914.

Water is treated and piped into all homes. Funds have been requested to develop two new water catchment dams, and construct a new 125,000-gal. water storage tank and treatment plant. Sewage is piped to a community septic tank, with effluent discharge through an ocean outfall. Refuse is collected three times a week; a new landfill site and incinerator were recently completed. The City recycles aluminum. [[Trident Seafoods]] operates its own water, sewer and electric facilities. Electricity is provided by Akutan Electric Utility.\n\nThere is one school located in the community, Akutan School of the [[Aleutians East Borough School District]] (AEBSD),<ref>\"[http://www.aebsd.org/schools Schools].\" [[Aleutians East Borough School District]].

The clinic is a qualified Emergency Care Center. Akutan is classified as an isolated town/Sub-Regional Center, it is found in EMS Region 2H in the Aleutian/Pribilof Region. Emergency Services have coastal and helicopter access. Emergency service is provided by volunteers and a health aide.

Auxiliary health care is provided by Akutan First Responders (907-698-2208/2315);  or by flight to Unalaska or Anchorage.\n\nTransportation is provided by seaplane, by private or fleet fishing vessels,  and the State Ferry makes monthly visits in summer weather.\n\n[[Image:PenAir Grumman Goose.jpg|right|thumb|275px|A [[Grumman Goose]] operated by [[Pen Air]] at Akutan]]\n\n== Economy and transportation ==\nCommercial fish processing dominates Akutan's cash-based economy, and not many locals are seasonally employed. Trident Seafoods operates a large processing plant west of the City for cod, crab, pollock and fish meal. The population of Akutan can quadruple or quintuple during processing months. Seven residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for halibut and other groundfish. Subsistence foods include seal, salmon, herring, halibut, clams, wild cattle, and game birds.\n\n===Transportation===\n\nBoats and amphibious aircraft, hovercraft, or helicopter are the only means of transportation into and out of Akutan. A {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} dock and a small boat mooring basin are available. Plans are underway to develop a practical way to get to a large boat harbor that has been built at the head of the bay. The State Ferry operates from Kodiak bi-monthly between May and October. Cargo is delivered weekly by freighter from Seattle; the City owns and operates a landing craft, the M/V Akutan. Akutan has no airstrip due to the steep terrain, however, a [[Akutan Seaplane Base|seaplane base]] is available and open to the public.  Helicopter service between Akutan and [[Akun Island]], the location of [[Akutan Airport]], began in February 2014. The only airline company serving the airport is [[Grant Aviation]], flying to nearby Dutch Harbor. The airport was expected to cost $77 million of which nearly $60 million came from the U.S. federal government. Trident paid $1 million towards the cost of the airport.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/10/07/tuchman-alaska-airport.cnn Alaska's 'airport to nowhere'], CNN, Gary Tuchman, October 7, 2011</ref>\n\n===Taxes===\nSales: None, Property: None, Special: 1% Raw Fish Tax (City); 2% Raw Fish Tax (Borough)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/e569dafa-a01c-4f00-92c2-b27d9ee32ea8 Akutan] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193052/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_1_5map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121646/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/01090.pdf 2010], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222085638/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/maps/place/2014/01090.pdf 2014]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090526012344/http://dot.alaska.gov/creg/akutan/assets/AkutanEA_report.pdf Akutan report]\n* {{HABS |survey=AK-96 |id=ak0315 |title=Village of Akutan, Akutan, Aleutians East Borough, AK}}\n\n{{Aleutians East Borough, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Aleutians East Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1878]]\n", "name_user": "Lam-ang", "label": "safe", "comment": "+{{GNIS 4}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akutan,_Alaska"}

In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in [[Country music]] cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin.<ref name=\"decline\"/><ref name=\"place\"/> However, there are many exceptions, for example: [[Lady Antebellum]]'s song \u2018This City\u2019, [[Danielle Bradbery]]'s \u2018[[Young in America]]\u2019, and many others.\n\nLyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|first = Sheila|last = Davis\n|title=The Songwriter's Idea

In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in [[Country music]] cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin.<ref name=\"decline\"/><ref name=\"place\"/> However, there are many exceptions, for example: [[Lady Antebellum]]'s song \u2018This City\u2019, [[Danielle Bradbery]]'s \u2018[[Young in America]]\u2019, and many others.\n\nLyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|first = Sheila|last = Davis\n|title=The Songwriter's Idea

{"title_page": "Fore River Bridge", "text_new": "[[File:New Fore River Bridge and temp.agr.jpg|thumb|New Fore River Bridge and its temporary replacement]]\n[[File:Fore River Bridge, Quincy, Mass (61577).jpg|thumb|Postcard view c. 1940s]]\n\nThe '''Fore River Bridge''' spans the [[Weymouth Fore River]] between [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]].  The new bridge replaced a bascule bridge that was built in 1936.  The bascule bridge was demolished in the early 2000s as it was considered structurally deficient and unsafe.  The Mass DOT then erected a temporary vertical lift bridge rising to 200\u2019 which stayed in place until the new bridge was completed in 2018.  The replacement Fore River vertical lift bridge has an increased vertical clearance of 60\u2019 in the closed position and over 220\u2019 in the open position.  This will help reduce the number of openings during the busy summer months.  The navigable channel horizontal clearance increased the previous width of 175\u2019 to 250\u2019 and can now accommodate larger marine freighters providing better access to the Fore River\u2019s Designated Port Area.  In addition, dolphins and fenders were installed to protect the new bridge structure from ship collision.  The total length of the bridge including the approaches is 2,216\u2019.  The bridge architecture of the new vertical lift bridge is inspired in the Art Deco features on the demolished 1936 previous bridge but has been interpreted for modern times.

The new bridge replaced a bascule bridge that was built in 1936.  The bascule bridge was demolished in the early 2000\u2019s as it was considered structurally deficient and unsafe.  The Mass DOT then erected a temporary vertical lift bridge rising to 200\u2019 which stayed in place until the new bridge was completed in 2018.  The replacement Fore River vertical lift bridge has an increased vertical clearance of 60\u2019 in the closed position and over 220\u2019 in the open position.  This will help reduce the number of openings during the busy summer months.  The navigable channel horizontal clearance increased the previous width of 175\u2019 to 250\u2019 and can now accommodate larger marine freighters providing better access to the Fore River\u2019s Designated Port Area.  In addition, dolphins and fenders were installed to protect the new bridge structure from ship collision.  The total length of the bridge including the approaches is 2,216\u2019.  The bridge architecture of the new vertical lift bridge is inspired in the Art Deco features on the demolished 1936 previous bridge but has been interpreted for modern times.  The bridge includes a signature light grey color, a stainless steel mesh enclosure that wraps around the access stairs, elevators, and other ancillary bridge components, textured concrete and aesthetic LED blue lighting.\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe Fore River Bridge was built at an approximate cost of $272 million and construction lasted 6 years with final completion in 2018.
