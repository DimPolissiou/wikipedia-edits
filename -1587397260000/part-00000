Si, avant cette p\u00e9riode, les jeunes sont les laiss\u00e9s-pour-compte de la litt\u00e9rature romanesque, cette entr\u00e9e tardive est compens\u00e9e par la place centrale qu\u2019ils occupent dans le roman de formation.

In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he or she is ultimately accepted into society\u2014the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\n[[Franco Moretti]] \"argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''\".<ref>Lazzaro-Weis, Carol, \"The Female 'Bildungsroman': Calling It into Question\", ''NWSA Journal'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16\u201334.</ref>\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' (\"development novel\") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation.

In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\n[[Franco Moretti]] \"argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''\".<ref>Lazzaro-Weis, Carol, \"The Female 'Bildungsroman': Calling It into Question\", ''NWSA Journal'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16\u201334.</ref>\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed.

He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Two people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested.<ref name=\"ramaswamy2210\">[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 1997]], p. 226</ref>\n\n===Rise to power===\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the [[Kulithalai]] seat in the 1957 election.

He has held various positions in the party and government during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.\n\n====70's and Emergency====\nDuring the [[Emergency]], the DMK was the only ruling party across India that opposed the Emergency,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} for which his government was summarily dismissed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government and many of his party leaders were arrested and jailed till the Emergency was lifted. Later, the D.M.K teamed up with the [[Janata Party]] post-Emergency, but suffered defeat at the assembly elections under accusations of corruption .\n\nHis one time friend [[M. G. Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK then suffered multiple electoral defeats against his primary opponent M.G.Ramachandran's AIADMK, until the latter's death in 1987.\n[[File:The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalaignar M.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too.

Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains.

If sufficient water for irrigation is at hand, any hot, cold{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}, sandy or rocky desert can be greened. Water can be made available through saving, reuse, rainwater harvesting, desalination, or direct use of seawater for [[Halotolerance|salt-loving]] plants. These different paths have unique features, i.e.: conserving water is a cheap solution. Reuse of treated water and the closing of cycles is the most efficient because closed cycles stand for unlimited and sustainable supply - rainwater management is a decentralized solution and applicable for inland areas<ref name=\"May\"/> - desalination is very secure as long as the primary energy for the operation of the desalination plant is available - Direct use of seawater for seawater agriculture is the most potent, only limited by the need for pumping up the water from sea-level.\n\nNovel type of desalination is done with the [[Sahara Forest Project]]. This project uses [[solar still]]s for the generation of the freshwater.\nAnother novel technique is [[cloud seeding]], either by  artificial means or through the action of cloud-seeding bacteria that live on vegetation (e.g. ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]''). \nAnother, \"atmospheric water generation\" or air to water, uses [[dehumidification]] and is used by the military for potable water generation. However this technology uses 200 times more energy than desalination, making it unsuitable for large scale desert greening.\n\n==Water distribution==\n\nOnce the fresh water or seawater has been attained in centralized systems it must be distributed. This can be done using dug canals or in some instances [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s (which are both the least attractive option since they allow much water to be evaporated), troughs (as used in the [[Keita Integrated Development Project|Keita Project]]<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=11 March 2012 }}</ref>), earthenware piping (semi-open or closed) or even underground systems i.e. [[Qanat|qan\u0101t]].\n\nDepending on the method of distribution of the water, it can then be provided on different methods to the plants. A costly solution (used only on pipes) is [[drip irrigation]]. Other methods are the use of [[wadi]]s (basically V-shaped ponds dug in the earth) or by simply planting the trees in holes inside/over the water pipe itself. The tree's roots can then suck the water straight from the water pipe (used in qan\u0101t, hydroponics, ...) A similar technique can be done with semi-open pipes (i.e. dug throughs in the Keita Project).\n\n==Side effects==\n\nThe use of water is, however, not always without problems. Desert greening by the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority]] irrigation scheme in [[Afghanistan]] significantly reduced the water flowing from the [[Helmand River]] into [[Hamun Lake|Lake Hamun]] and this, together with drought, was cited as a key reason for the severe damage to the ecology of Lake Hamun, much of which has degenerated since 1999 from a [[Ramsar Convention|wetland of international importance]] into [[Dry lake|salt flats]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/hamoun/ |last=Weier |first=John |title=From Wetland to Wasteland; Destruction of the Hamoun Oasis |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |date={{date|2002-12-03}} |accessdate={{date|2012-05-11}} }}</ref>\n\n==Trees==\nA main component of desert greening is the planting of trees.

High speed winds blow soil from the desert, depositing some on neighboring fertile lands, and causing shifting sand dunes within the desert, which buries fences and blocks roads and railway tracks. A permanent solution to this problem of shifting sand dunes can be provided by planting appropriate species on the dunes to prevent further shifting and planting [[windbreak]]s and [[shelterbelts]]. These solutions also provide protection from hot or cold and desiccating winds and the invasion of sand. The [[Rajasthan Canal]] system in India is the major irrigation scheme of the Thar Desert and is intended to reclaim it and to check spreading of the desert to fertile areas.\n\nPrevention of shifting sand dunes is accomplished through plantations of ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' near [[Laxmangarh]] town. There are few local tree species suitable for planting in the desert region and these are slow growing. The introduction of exotic tree species in the desert for plantation has become necessary. Many species of [[Eucalyptus]], [[Acacia]], [[Cassia (legume)|Cassia]] and other genera from [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[United States|US]], [[Russia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], and [[Sudan]] have been tried in the Thar Desert. ''Acacia tortilis'' has proved to be the most promising species for desert greening. The [[jojoba]] is another promising species of economic value which has been found suitable for planting in these areas.\n\n[[Sundrop Farms]] launched a greenhouse in 2016 to produce 15,000 tonnes of tomatoes using only desert soil and desalinated water piped from [[Spencer Gulf]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2108296-first-farm-to-grow-veg-in-a-desert-using-only-sun-and-seawater/ |title=First farm to grow veg in a desert using only sun and seawater |date=6 October 2016 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Al Baydha Project]]\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]]\n* [[Conquest of the desert exhibition]]\n* [[Desert farming]]\n* [[Fertilizer tree]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Oasification]]\n* [[Thar Desert]]\n* [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]\n* [[Wadi Rum Consultancy]]\n* [[Water crisis]]\n* [[Groasis Waterboxx]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change.html \"How to green the desert and reverse climate change\"]  [[Allan Savory]],  ''[[TED (conference)|TED talk]]'', February 2013.\n*[http://www.greeningthedesert.com/ Greening the Desert] \n*[https://www.upsidedownblogger.space/2020/04/is-it-possible-to-make-sahara-green-is.html \"https://www.upsidedownblogger.space/2020/04/is-it-possible-to-make-sahara-green-is.html\" ] \n*[http://permaculture.org.au/2009/12/11/greening-the-desert-ii-final/ Greening the Desert II \u2013 Final] \n*[http://www.prototype-creation.de TS Prototype-Creation]\n\n{{deforestation and desertification}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Deserts|Greening]]\n[[Category:Desert greening]]\n[[Category:Ecosystems]]\n[[Category:Land reclamation]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Sahara satellite hires.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of the [[Sahara]], the world's largest hot desert and third largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic.]]\n\n'''Desert greening''' is the process of man-made reclamation of deserts for ecological reasons ([[biodiversity]]), [[farming]] and [[forestry]], but also for reclamation of natural water systems and other ecological systems that support life.

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane. The musical went on to win the most Tony Awards in history with 12 wins.<ref>https://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/facts/index.html</ref> Broderick and Lane reprised their roles in the 2005 film adaptation of [[The Producers (2005 film)|the same name]].\n\nBroderick was reunited with his co-star from ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', [[Nathan Lane]], in ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', which opened on Broadway in October 2005.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

Grey received minor injuries, including whiplash.\n\nBroderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he was in the wrong lane: \"I don't remember the day.

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983). His first big hit film was ''[[WarGames]]'', a summer hit in [[1983 in film|1983]],<ref name=tstbhl>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eeIhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JGMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6966%2C1801595|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title=Matthew Broderick toast of Broadway, Hollywood|date=July 19, 1983|page=A7}}</ref> in which he played the main role of David Lightman, a [[Seattle]] teen [[Hacker (term)|hacker]].

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

Most [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] stories agree he was an older half-brother of [[Paikea]] and 69 other sons, while traditions recorded from the [[Cook Islands]] sometimes state he was [[Uenuku#Other characters|Uanuku Rakeiora]]'s only son.\n\nIn the oral traditions of the Cook Islands, Ruatapu travels around central Polynesia; from the [[Society Islands]], to the Cook Islands, and lastly to [[Tonga]] before coming back to the Cook Islands to live out the rest of his days and eventually die at [[Aitutaki]]. Most traditions record him as a prominent ancestor, gaining three wives between the last two groups of islands.\n\n==Cook Island traditions==\nThe stories relating to Ruatapu's life are fairly consistent with each other.

For this he crafted the canoe ''Te Kareroaitai'' out of a [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tamanu tree]] before setting out to the ocean upon reaching adulthood. Eight or nine days later, he arrived at [[Rarotonga#Subdivisions|Avarua]] Harbour at [[Rarotonga|Rarotonga]] and met local Chief Potikitaua of Avananui village who told him the island's ariki was Chief Tangiia. He decided to settle here, and found a wife out of Uanukukaiatia,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Uanukutapu, with whom he had a son with named Tamaiva.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nFour years later, Ruatapu left Rarotonga alone in search of a new island, leaving Tamaiva to grow up and become the island's ariki.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> After many days and nights at sea, Ruatapu arrived at [[Tongatapu|Tongatapu]] where the first person he met was Tapotuki Tonga, who informed him that the island's ariki was Chief Kaukura. Ruatapu stayed with Tapotuki Tonga, growing fond of her, and ended up having another son with her named Moenau.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nWhile the child was still young, Ruatapu decided to leave again, but first instructing Tapotuki Tonga's father Rangiura to take Moenau back to Rarotonga to be with Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva, to share share chiefly authority.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Rangiura being another noted canoe voyager, constructed a new canoe for this voyage and named it ''Pouara''. On this trip, the canoe capsized on a reef. The spot where this happened was called ''Vaenga'', the place where they landed is today called ''Pouara'' after the canoe. A man named Anga brought them to Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva. Upon the two families meeting, Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva were jealous of Moenau and did not wish to take him in. They instructed that he should be taken to the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru islands]] ([[Atiu]], [[Mauke|Ma'uke]], and [[Mitiaro]]) where he could become ariki. After five days of rest and repairing the canoe ''Pouara'', Rangiura and Moenau set out to Ngaputoru. On this voyage they struck bad weather and Rangiura was killed on the reef of Ma'uke. Moenau survived and was taken in by the local people.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nOnce he had grown into a strong young man, Moenau married a native Ma'uke woman named Te Kaumarokura,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Te Raumarokura, with whom he had a son named Te Aukura (sometimes ''-arikiki Mauketau'' is added, meaning 'Ariki of Mauketau').<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Due to Moenau's greed in taking all the fishermans' catchments for himself, the people of Ma\u2018uke devised a plan to kill him. Two warriors named Taratekui and Taratekurapo were chosen to kill Moenau using a fine cord made out of coconut-fibre (''kaa natipui''). After luring him out of his house, they caught him by the testicles with the cord and overpowered him, killing him with spears before throwing the body into a cave in the [[Makatea (district)|Makatea]]. While the people of Ma'uke were joyed that he was gone, Te Kaumarokura grieved over her loss, and feared she would be killed along with their now four year old son Te Aukura. Instead, Taratekui and Taratekurapo pitied them, and would bring fish to them every week.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Return to the Cook Islands===\nAll this time, Ruatapu had been on Tongatapu waiting for Rangiura to return with news of a safe arrival to Rarotonga. Due to the amount of time that had passed, he feared the worst, and tracked down his eldest son Tamaiva to ask where Moenau and Rangiura were. Tamaiva, now an adult, told Ruatapu that he had indeed met Moenau long ago as a child, but sent him to Ngaputoru. This angered Ruatapu, who at once set out for Ma'uke Island where he found a group of children playing by the beach. One child was his grandson, Te Aukura, who told him that Moenau had been killed. Te Aukura brought Ruatapu to his mother Te Kaumarokura, who was with Taratekui and Taratekurapo. She told Ruatapu they were her relatives, not her husbands, and that they were looking after her and the child.\n\nAfter Ruatapu had fallen asleep in their house, the warriors confessed to Te Kaumarokura that they feared him - surely he must be a great ariki, or even an [[atua]], and begged her to not tell him what they did to his son, to which she agreed, so he could not avenge his son's death. The next morning, Ruatapu enquired about his son's death and whether he could take the child with him. Te Kaumarokura told him a half-truth; Moenau had 'fallen' into a cave at Makatea, and had not been slain. Te Aukura did not wish to go with him, which Ruatapu respected, saying that if he left the island, Moenau's name and lineage would be forgotten there.\n\nThree days after leaving the island, Ruatapu finally met a fisherman who told him the truth of Moenau's death, as every other person on the island had been afraid of him. Ruatapu, though, said it was too late to turn around and kill them, for he had already left in peace.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> Alternatively, Te Aukura had told him on their first meeting what had happened to Moenau, and so he killed a large number of the island's inhabitants by rolling the logs of coconut trees atop of them from a higher place.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nThe next evening he arrived at Atiu Island and went ashore, meeting the ariki Chief Renga, who asked him to help improve a natural passage through a reef called Taunganui, and make it fit for canoes. Ruatapu agreed, but had to cut his time on Atiu short when he found there wasn't enough food for everybody on the island. Chief Renga gave him food and gifts for his next voyage; some coconuts, a [[Kuhl's lorikeet|kura]] bird, a moo bird, and the roots of the [[Gardenia taitensis|tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] which grows sweet-smelling flowers.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> He also renamed his then-canoe from ''Te Kareroakite Enuamanu'', to ''Tueumoana''.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n[[File:Starr 070221-4646 Gardenia sp..jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|[[Gardenia taitensis|Tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] at the [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] Aquatic Center. A specific tree that Ruatapu planted, ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'', is said to still be the largest of its species in the Cook Islands.]]\nAfter three days of travel, Ruatapu found two large uninhabited islands sharing a lagoon, collectively naming the area [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuenua]] because of the large groups of [[Red-billed tropicbird|tavake]] that were nesting there. He spent four days resting on the island, freeing the birds he was given, planting some of the tiar\u00e9 maori roots and the coconut to grow a tree which he named ''Te Tuia Rongo'',<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> or ''Tuiorongo'', and naming the planted tiar\u00e9 maori roots ''(Te) Aravaine''.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Settling at Aitutaki===\nNext, traveling west-north-west, he arrived at a [[Aitutaki#Minor islands of Aitutaki|lagoon with a number of small islands]] and one large island, where he passed through a small reef passage named Kopuaonu and stayed on Oaka Island, at the shingle spit called ''Te Okaokaanga-i-te niu-a Ruatapu''. The next morning he found and ate a large ''[[Hermit crab|unga]]'' slightly further inland, naming the spot ''Kaiunga''. Next he planted the last of his tiar\u00e9 maori root, naming it ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'' after his second wife Tapotuki Tonga,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or sometimes known as ''Te tiar\u00e9 a Ruatapu''. He then moved onto the mainland of this lagoon, naming the place where he landed ''Maitai'', and moving slightly further inland he named ''Paengamanuiri'' after erecting an altar for the worship of [[atua|'evil' spirits]], where the appellation of ''Vai-tiar\u00e9'' made out of tiar\u00e9 flowers may still be seen today,<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> and then moving even further in he built his marae called ''Aumatangi''. This was all very near to a small settlement called Vaitupa, on the island of [[Aitutaki|Ututakienuao Ru]], today called Aitutaki. The ariki was Chief Taruia.\n\nFinally he settled among the people of Vaitupa, taking Tutunoa as his wife, by whom he had four children. Two boys; Kirikava and Te Urutupui, a girl named Tongirau, and a boy named Touketa. When Kirikava had grown old enough, he asked his father to teach him fishing practices. So Ruatapu gathered the bark of an [[Hibiscus|au tree]] and treated it with ''kiriau'' - a process of leaving it in the sea for a few days before bringing it to land, to keep it from rotting for about a year. He called the people of Vaitupa to help make the nets, as they had never had nets on the island before. Together they completed a small net called a ''tuturua'', which Ruatapu gave to his son Te Urutupui. After completing a bigger net for Kirikava, the villagers were divided into two groups, one for each net.\n\nBoth nets caught great catches of fish each. Kirikava divided the big fish (and two turtles) amongst the men in his party, but forgetting to give some to his father, while Te Urutupui gave Ruatapu the finest fish of his catchment of small fish. By showing gratitude to his father in this action, he ensured his net would always catch lots of fish. The next time the nets were left and pulled out, the brothers did the same as before, Kirikava's actions only making Ruatapu angry for not following [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] traditions. Kirikava replied that because Ruatapu was an ariki, so too must he, and that since he was the master of his own net, he could decide what to do with it. This being the last straw, Ruatapu banished Kirikava from his house and disowned him, stating he would not be an ariki for very long. At this Kirikava left the home, and settled his own marae called Aputu and married Te Nonoioiva, with whom he had a son named Maevarangi. Te Urutupui also took Vainepuarangi as his own wife, both wives were brought to the island by one Ru. Tongirau married a man named Te Araroa, and had a child named Te Aunuio-ota, who Ruatapu would train in wrestling and spear-fighting.\n\nRuatapu grew older, and instructed Te Urutupui to take his wife to Manuenua where he could live as ariki. He gave them the canoe Tueumoana, and it took three days for them to arrive at the smaller island where Ruatapu had earlier planted the flowers and coconuts. They moved over to the bigger island and named it Te Auo Tepui.\n\nTwo years later, Rongovei arrived to Manuenua in his canoe, the ''Tanemaitai'', and became very good friends with Te Urutupui, who told him to go back to the island of his father and bring back a wife and rule as ariki. This he did, landing at a passage called Ruaikakau near the settlement of Reureutematao Te Erui, where he took Tiapara and Punanga-atua as his wives before visiting Ruatapu to deliver news of his son. They returned back to Manuenua and lived on the smaller island.\n\n===Becoming Ariki===\nOne day, Ruatapu went up to the highest point of [[Aitutaki]] where he rested under an utu tree, out of anger towards his son Kirikava, in search of a new home. He rested under this tree at a spot which he called ''Teutumarama'', before venturing further. Kirikava ran to catch up with him upon finding out he was gone, and begged Ruatapu not to leave. Ruatapu told him to leave, threatening to kill him with his spear and axe if he did not. Kirikava replied: \u201cAll right, my father, if it pleases you to kill your son, do so. I won\u2019t try to stop you.\u201d to which Ruatapu broke down and wept. He asked him to sit down so they could talk to each other, and they arranged two lines of black stones as they resolved their differences, calling the spot ''Te Ruatoke''. Ruatapu instructed him to return home to Vaitupa where his brother and sister still lived, promising not to forget them if he became the ariki. This Kirikava did and Ruatapu continued on to a settlement called Anainga, where he found the people bringing food to the ariki, Chief Taruia. Ruatapu decided to take Taruia's place as ariki, and created a small model canoe called a kopae out of coconut leaves. He set it in the lagoon where one of Taruia's warriors caught it, and ran to show him, amazed and having never seen anything like it. Taruia said this was an ''akairo'' (sign) that another ariki was present on the island and that his people should find this ariki somewhere at a place called Te Upokoenua, where indeed Ruatapu was found sitting in the sand, and was brought back to Taruia, who insisted Ruatapu stay with him and accept food.\n\nSome days later Ruatapu suggested they dam a small creek named Vaireirei from running into the ocean, wasting fresh water. This was a contest of skill, which Ruatapu completed under two days, successfully damming the creek. A second challenge which Ruatapu suggested, was to see who could build a canoe the fastest before traveling to other islands. Taruia asked what purpose there would be in traveling, as all islands were about the same anyway, and no more exciting than Aitutaki. At this Ruatapu laughed, saying there were many bigger islands, and some with beautiful women of much lighter complexion - some almost white - and with a brighter hair tone, all of this sounded much better to Taruia than what his island already offered. Once again, Ruatapu proved to be the more skilled ariki, completing his canoe first and calling it ''Te Atua-apaipai''.\n\nRuatapu brought the canoe down to the lagoon, and said he'd venture out in the morning. Taruia asked him not to go as his own canoe was almost finished, and they could go together. Ruatapu wouldn't agree to this at first, saying he would go first and call back out to Taruia from Rarotonga. Afterwards, he said he would wait until the day after to give Taruia time to finish the canoe.\n\nOn the day they were ready, Ruatapu set out his canoe two hours ahead of Taruia, and intentionally capsized it knowing Taruia would find him in the water. This happened near a small island named Mainainara, and the exact spot where it happened was named ''Raukuruvaka''. It was not long before Taruia found him and Ruatapu pleaded for his help. Taruia laughed at him, telling him that he instead would wait in Rarotonga and call back out to Ruatapu, just as he said he would to Taruia. He laughed again before sailing away out of sight. Ruatapu quickly righted his canoe and headed back for Aitutaki, calling all the [[Mataiapo|mataipo]] together and telling the people that he did not know whether Taruia was alive. The people agreed that Ruatapu should become Aitutaki's new ariki.\n\nTaruia, having safely landed in Rarotonga, slowly began to realise what Ruatapu had done, and feared he had stolen the title of ariki from him. He gathered some strong men from amongst his new friends at Rarotonga and sailed back to reclaim his position. The people Aitutaki saw Taruia's war party heading back, and Ruatapu decided to engage them in a fight, so they battled at the Ruaikakau passage, in the water. Taruia and his people withdrew and traveled for three weeks to another island, [[Penrhyn atoll|M\u0101ngarongaro]], where Taruia's descendants still live today.\n\nRuatapu, now an old man with death closing in on him, sent for his son Kirikava to come live with him in the chief's house - Paepaeoronga - and become the new ariki upon his death. Soon, news came from Ruatapu's home village Taputapuatea that a new warrior named Tuotakura had become known amongst many islands as talented in martial arts skills such as wrestling and spear-fighting. He lived on the island of [[Tahiti]]. Since Kirikava had disobeyed his father when he was younger, he could not take on this warrior. However after much convincing, Ruatapu allowed for his people to build Kirikava a canoe to take him to Tahiti.\n\nIn a few days after arriving at Tahiti, he had watched other young warriors duel with Tuotakura, and knew he would be no match. Indeed, he proved to be no match in a contest of wrestling, and went home ashamed. This defeat, which Ruatapu could not correct himself as he was too old, depressed him so much that it sent him into bad health, and before long he had passed away, making Kirikava the new ariki of Aitutaki.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori traditions==\n[[File:Comb, Maori people, whalebone, collected during James Cook's second circumnavigation 1772-75 by Anders Sparrman - Etnografiska museet - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC00816.JPG|thumb|right|350x350px|A M\u0101ori whalebone comb at Etnografiska museet, collected by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] - so often, the denial of a sacred comb is the catalyst for Ruatapu's revenge.]]\nIn the M\u0101ori traditions of Ruatapu's life, he is always a son of Chief Uenuku, ariki of [[Hawaiki]], and is belittled by him for being his only son born of a slave wife, and therefore being unable to use a sacred comb in his hair. With the exception of [[Paikea]], Ruatapu kills Hawaiki's nobility aboard a canoe in every telling. The story is particularly well-known to tribes that originated in the [[Gisborne District]] such as [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]], [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]], and [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]], and especially Ng\u0101ti Porou's [[hap\u016b]] Ng\u0101ti Konohi.\n\nIn one telling of the legend, Ruatapu had been belittled by Uenuku for using the sacred comb of his elder brother, [[Paikea|Kahutiaterangi]]. As revenge, Ruatapu enticed most of Uenuku's children into his canoe, sailed them to the ocean, and then sank it in an event called ''Te Huripureiata''. Kahutiaterangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as Paikea. Meanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants.

When Ruatapu asked why his father had not treated his hair, Uenuku told him he could not because he was the only son of a slave woman, and his hair was not tapu like his brothers'. This put Ruatapu to shame, and so he refused to eat dinner that night, instead going down to the canoe and putting a hole in its bottom, before filling it with wood chips and hiding the canoe's bailer. In the morning when they launched the canoe, Ruatapu hid the hole with his heel. When they were far out at sea he released the hole and removed the chips. The water rushed in, and nobody could find the bailer as Ruatapu had hidden it on shore. Everybody drowned, except Paikea, who was saved through his mother's ancestor [[Tangaroa]] who summoned the whale. Ruatapu's last attempt at killing Paikea was to use an incantation to hurl waves at him. This backfired as Paikea was too far away now, and the waves just rolled back onto Ruatapu thus drowning him.<ref name=\"TeAo\">{{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao40TeA/c5.html|title=The Story of Paikea and Ruatapu|publisher=Te Puna M\u0101tauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ng\u0101ti Porou tradition===\nIn a tradition of Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutiaterangi ahead of him in status.

For this he crafted the canoe ''Te Kareroaitai'' out of a [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tamanu tree]] before setting out to the ocean upon reaching adulthood. Eight or nine days later, he arrived at [[Rarotonga#Subdivisions|Avarua]] Harbour at [[Rarotonga|Rarotonga]] and met local Chief Potikitaua of Avananui village who told him the island's ariki was Chief Tangiia. He decided to settle here, and found a wife out of Uanukukaiatia,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Uanukutapu, with whom he had a son with named Tamaiva.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nFour years later, Ruatapu left Rarotonga alone in search of a new island, leaving Tamaiva to grow up and become the island's ariki.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> After many days and nights at sea, Ruatapu arrived at [[Tongatapu|Tongatapu]] where the first person he met was Tapotuki Tonga, who informed him that the island's ariki was Chief Kaukura. Ruatapu stayed with Tapotuki Tonga, growing fond of her, and ended up having another son with her named Moenau.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nWhile the child was still young, Ruatapu decided to leave again, but first instructing Tapotuki Tonga's father Rangiura to take Moenau back to Rarotonga to be with Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva, to share share chiefly authority.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Rangiura being another noted canoe voyager, constructed a new canoe for this voyage and named it ''Pouara''. On this trip, the canoe capsized on a reef. The spot where this happened was called ''Vaenga'', the place where they landed is today called ''Pouara'' after the canoe. A man named Anga brought them to Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva. Upon the two families meeting, Uanukukaiatia and Tamaiva were jealous of Moenau and did not wish to take him in. They instructed that he should be taken to the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru islands]] ([[Atiu]], [[Mauke|Ma'uke]], and [[Mitiaro]]) where he could become ariki. After five days of rest and repairing the canoe ''Pouara'', Rangiura and Moenau set out to Ngaputoru. On this voyage they struck bad weather and Rangiura was killed on the reef of Ma'uke. Moenau survived and was taken in by the local people.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\nOnce he had grown into a strong young man, Moenau married a native Ma'uke woman named Te Kaumarokura,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or Te Raumarokura, with whom he had a son named Te Aukura (sometimes ''-arikiki Mauketau'' is added, meaning 'Ariki of Mauketau').<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> Due to Moenau's greed in taking all the fishermans' catchments for himself, the people of Ma\u2018uke devised a plan to kill him. Two warriors named Taratekui and Taratekurapo were chosen to kill Moenau using a fine cord made out of coconut-fibre (''kaa natipui''). After luring him out of his house, they caught him by the testicles with the cord and overpowered him, killing him with spears before throwing the body into a cave in the [[Makatea (district)|Makatea]]. While the people of Ma'uke were joyed that he was gone, Te Kaumarokura grieved over her loss, and feared she would be killed along with their now four year old son Te Aukura. Instead, Taratekui and Taratekurapo pitied them, and would bring fish to them every week.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Return to the Cook Islands===\nAll this time, Ruatapu had been on Tongatapu waiting for Rangiura to return with news of a safe arrival to Rarotonga. Due to the amount of time that had passed, he feared the worst, and tracked down his eldest son Tamaiva to ask where Moenau and Rangiura were. Tamaiva, now an adult, told Ruatapu that he had indeed met Moenau long ago as a child, but sent him to Ngaputoru. This angered Ruatapu, who at once set out for Ma'uke Island where he found a group of children playing by the beach. One child was his grandson, Te Aukura, who told him that Moenau had been killed. Te Aukura brought Ruatapu to his mother Te Kaumarokura, who was with Taratekui and Taratekurapo. She told Ruatapu they were her relatives, not her husbands, and that they were looking after her and the child.\n\nAfter Ruatapu had fallen asleep in their house, the warriors confessed to Te Kaumarokura that they feared him - surely he must be a great ariki, or even an [[atua]], and begged her to not tell him what they did to his son, to which she agreed, so he could not avenge his son's death. The next morning, Ruatapu enquired about his son's death and whether he could take the child with him. Te Kaumarokura told him a half-truth; Moenau had 'fallen' into a cave at Makatea, and had not been slain. Te Aukura did not wish to go with him, which Ruatapu respected, saying that if he left the island, Moenau's name and lineage would be forgotten there.\n\nThree days after leaving the island, Ruatapu finally met a fisherman who told him the truth of Moenau's death, as every other person on the island had been afraid of him. Ruatapu, though, said it was too late to turn around and kill them, for he had already left in peace.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> Alternatively, Te Aukura had told him on their first meeting what had happened to Moenau, and so he killed a large number of the island's inhabitants by rolling the logs of coconut trees atop of them from a higher place.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n\nThe next evening he arrived at Atiu Island and went ashore, meeting the ariki Chief Renga, who asked him to help improve a natural passage through a reef called Taunganui, and make it fit for canoes. Ruatapu agreed, but had to cut his time on Atiu short when he found there wasn't enough food for everybody on the island. Chief Renga gave him food and gifts for his next voyage; some coconuts, a [[Kuhl's lorikeet|kura]] bird, a moo bird, and the roots of the [[Gardenia taitensis|tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] which grows sweet-smelling flowers.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> He also renamed his then-canoe from ''Te Kareroakite Enuamanu'', to ''Tueumoana''.<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/>\n[[File:Starr 070221-4646 Gardenia sp..jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|[[Gardenia taitensis|Tiar\u00e9 maori tree]] at the [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] Aquatic Center. A specific tree that Ruatapu planted, ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'', is said to still be the largest of its species in the Cook Islands.]]\nAfter three days of travel, Ruatapu found two large uninhabited islands sharing a lagoon, collectively naming the area [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuenua]] because of the large groups of [[Red-billed tropicbird|tavake]] that were nesting there. He spent four days resting on the island, freeing the birds he was given, planting some of the tiar\u00e9 maori roots and the coconut to grow a tree which he named ''Te Tuia Rongo'',<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> or ''Tuiorongo'', and naming the planted tiar\u00e9 maori roots ''(Te) Aravaine''.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n===Settling at Aitutaki===\nNext, traveling west-north-west, he arrived at a [[Aitutaki#Minor islands of Aitutaki|lagoon with a number of small islands]] and one large island, where he passed through a small reef passage named Kopuaonu and stayed on Oaka Island, at the shingle spit called ''Te Okaokaanga-i-te niu-a Ruatapu''. The next morning he found and ate a large ''[[Hermit crab|unga]]'' slightly further inland, naming the spot ''Kaiunga''. Next he planted the last of his tiar\u00e9 maori root, naming it ''Ngaevaevaiteinaiteupoko-o Tapotuki Tongatapu'' after his second wife Tapotuki Tonga,<ref name=\"TKoro\"/> or sometimes known as ''Te tiar\u00e9 a Ruatapu''. He then moved onto the mainland of this lagoon, naming the place where he landed ''Maitai'', and moving slightly further inland he named ''Paengamanuiri'' after erecting an altar for the worship of [[atua|'evil' spirits]], where the appellation of ''Vai-tiar\u00e9'' made out of tiar\u00e9 flowers may still be seen today,<ref name=\"PolySoc06-213/> and then moving even further in he built his marae called ''Aumatangi''. This was all very near to a small settlement called Vaitupa, on the island of [[Aitutaki|Ututakienuao Ru]], today called Aitutaki. The ariki was Chief Taruia.\n\nFinally he settled among the people of Vaitupa, taking Tutunoa as his wife, by whom he had four children. Two boys; Kirikava and Te Urutupui, a girl named Tongirau, and a boy named Touketa. When Kirikava had grown old enough, he asked his father to teach him fishing practices. So Ruatapu gathered the bark of an [[Hibiscus|au tree]] and treated it with ''kiriau'' - a process of leaving it in the sea for a few days before bringing it to land, to keep it from rotting for about a year. He called the people of Vaitupa to help make the nets, as they had never had nets on the island before. Together they completed a small net called a ''tuturua'', which Ruatapu gave to his son Te Urutupui. After completing a bigger net for Kirikava, the villagers were divided into two groups, one for each net.\n\nBoth nets caught great catches of fish each. Kirikava divided the big fish (and two turtles) amongst the men in his party, but forgetting to give some to his father, while Te Urutupui gave Ruatapu the finest fish of his catchment of small fish. By showing gratitude to his father in this action, he ensured his net would always catch lots of fish. The next time the nets were left and pulled out, the brothers did the same as before, Kirikava's actions only making Ruatapu angry for not following [[tapu]] traditions. Kirikava replied that because Ruatapu was an ariki, so too must he, and that since he was the master of his own net, he could decide what to do with it. This being the last straw, Ruatapu banished Kirikava from his house and disowned him, stating he would not be an ariki for very long. At this Kirikava left the home, and settled his own marae called Aputu and married Te Nonoioiva, with whom he had a son named Maevarangi. Te Urutupui also took Vainepuarangi as his own wife, both wives were brought to the island by one Ru. Tongirau married a man named Te Araroa, and had a child named Te Aunuio-ota, who Ruatapu would train in wrestling and spear-fighting.\n\nRuatapu grew older, and instructed Te Urutupui to take his wife to Manuenua where he could live as ariki. He gave them the canoe Tueumoana, and it took three days for them to arrive at the smaller island where Ruatapu had earlier planted the flowers and coconuts. They moved over to the bigger island and named it Te Auo Tepui.\n\nTwo years later, Rongovei arrived to Manuenua in his canoe, the ''Tanemaitai'', and became very good friends with Te Urutupui, who told him to go back to the island of his father and bring back a wife and rule as ariki. This he did, landing at a passage called Ruaikakau near the settlement of Reureutematao Te Erui, where he took Tiapara and Punanga-atua as his wives before visiting Ruatapu to deliver news of his son. They returned back to Manuenua and lived on the smaller island.\n\n===Becoming Ariki===\nOne day, Ruatapu went up to the highest point of [[Aitutaki]] where he rested under an utu tree, out of anger towards his son Kirikava, in search of a new home. He rested under this tree at a spot which he called ''Teutumarama'', before venturing further. Kirikava ran to catch up with him upon finding out he was gone, and begged Ruatapu not to leave. Ruatapu told him to leave, threatening to kill him with his spear and axe if he did not. Kirikava replied: \u201cAll right, my father, if it pleases you to kill your son, do so. I won\u2019t try to stop you.\u201d to which Ruatapu broke down and wept. He asked him to sit down so they could talk to each other, and they arranged two lines of black stones as they resolved their differences, calling the spot ''Te Ruatoke''. Ruatapu instructed him to return home to Vaitupa where his brother and sister still lived, promising not to forget them if he became the ariki. This Kirikava did and Ruatapu continued on to a settlement called Anainga, where he found the people bringing food to the ariki, Chief Taruia. Ruatapu decided to take Taruia's place as ariki, and created a small model canoe called a kopae out of coconut leaves. He set it in the lagoon where one of Taruia's warriors caught it, and ran to show him, amazed and having never seen anything like it. Taruia said this was an ''akairo'' (sign) that another ariki was present on the island and that his people should find this ariki somewhere at a place called Te Upokoenua, where indeed Ruatapu was found sitting in the sand, and was brought back to Taruia, who insisted Ruatapu stay with him and accept food.\n\nSome days later Ruatapu suggested they dam a small creek named Vaireirei from running into the ocean, wasting fresh water. This was a contest of skill, which Ruatapu completed under two days, successfully damming the creek. A second challenge which Ruatapu suggested, was to see who could build a canoe the fastest before traveling to other islands. Taruia asked what purpose there would be in traveling, as all islands were about the same anyway, and no more exciting than Aitutaki. At this Ruatapu laughed, saying there were many bigger islands, and some with beautiful women of much lighter complexion - some almost white - and with a brighter hair tone, all of this sounded much better to Taruia than what his island already offered. Once again, Ruatapu proved to be the more skilled ariki, completing his canoe first and calling it ''Te Atua-apaipai''.\n\nRuatapu brought the canoe down to the lagoon, and said he'd venture out in the morning. Taruia asked him not to go as his own canoe was almost finished, and they could go together. Ruatapu wouldn't agree to this at first, saying he would go first and call back out to Taruia from Rarotonga. Afterwards, he said he would wait until the day after to give Taruia time to finish the canoe.\n\nOn the day they were ready, Ruatapu set out his canoe two hours ahead of Taruia, and intentionally capsized it knowing Taruia would find him in the water. This happened near a small island named Mainainara, and the exact spot where it happened was named ''Raukuruvaka''. It was not long before Taruia found him and Ruatapu pleaded for his help. Taruia laughed at him, telling him that he instead would wait in Rarotonga and call back out to Ruatapu, just as he said he would to Taruia. He laughed again before sailing away out of sight. Ruatapu quickly righted his canoe and headed back for Aitutaki, calling all the [[Mataiapo|mataipo]] together and telling the people that he did not know whether Taruia was alive. The people agreed that Ruatapu should become Aitutaki's new ariki.\n\nTaruia, having safely landed in Rarotonga, slowly began to realise what Ruatapu had done, and feared he had stolen the title of ariki from him. He gathered some strong men from amongst his new friends at Rarotonga and sailed back to reclaim his position. The people Aitutaki saw Taruia's war party heading back, and Ruatapu decided to engage them in a fight, so they battled at the Ruaikakau passage, in the water. Taruia and his people withdrew and traveled for three weeks to another island, [[Penrhyn atoll|M\u0101ngarongaro]], where Taruia's descendants still live today.\n\nRuatapu, now an old man with death closing in on him, sent for his son Kirikava to come live with him in the chief's house - Paepaeoronga - and become the new ariki upon his death. Soon, news came from Ruatapu's home village Taputapuatea that a new warrior named Tuotakura had become known amongst many islands as talented in martial arts skills such as wrestling and spear-fighting. He lived on the island of [[Tahiti]]. Since Kirikava had disobeyed his father when he was younger, he could not take on this warrior. However after much convincing, Ruatapu allowed for his people to build Kirikava a canoe to take him to Tahiti.\n\nIn a few days after arriving at Tahiti, he had watched other young warriors duel with Tuotakura, and knew he would be no match. Indeed, he proved to be no match in a contest of wrestling, and went home ashamed. This defeat, which Ruatapu could not correct himself as he was too old, depressed him so much that it sent him into bad health, and before long he had passed away, making Kirikava the new ariki of Aitutaki.<ref name=\"TKoro\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori traditions==\n[[File:Comb, Maori people, whalebone, collected during James Cook's second circumnavigation 1772-75 by Anders Sparrman - Etnografiska museet - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC00816.JPG|thumb|right|350x350px|A M\u0101ori whalebone comb at Etnografiska museet, collected by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] - so often, the denial of a sacred comb is the catalyst for Ruatapu's revenge.]]\nIn the M\u0101ori traditions of Ruatapu's life, he is always a son of Chief Uenuku, ariki of [[Hawaiki]], and is belittled by him for being his only son born of a slave wife, and therefore being unable to use a sacred comb in his hair. With the exception of [[Paikea]], Ruatapu kills Hawaiki's nobility aboard a canoe in every telling. The story is particularly well-known to tribes that originated in the [[Gisborne District]] such as [[Ng\u0101ti Porou]], [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]], and [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]], and especially Ng\u0101ti Porou's [[hap\u016b]] Ng\u0101ti Konohi.\n\nIn one telling of the legend, Ruatapu had been belittled by Uenuku for using the sacred comb of his elder brother, [[Paikea|Kahutiaterangi]]. As revenge, Ruatapu enticed most of Uenuku's children into his canoe, sailed them to the ocean, and then sank it in an event called ''Te Huripureiata''. Kahutiaterangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as Paikea. Meanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants. Paikea fled to high ground and was saved through the intervention of the goddess [[Moakuramanu]]. One version of the myth holds that Ruatapu drowned in the flood and that his bowels became the first jellyfish.<ref name=\"Craig1989\">{{cite book|author=R.D. Craig|date=1989|title=Dictionary of Polynesian Mythology|location=New York|publisher=Canterbury University Press|p=237}}</ref><ref name=\"Reedy1993\">{{cite book|author=Reedy, Anaru|date=1993|title=Ng\u0101 K\u014drero a Mohi Ruatapu, tohunga rongonui o Ng\u0101ti Porou: The Writings of Mohi Ruatapu|location=Christchurch|publisher=Canterbury University Press|pp=142-146}}</ref>\n\nAnother telling says that Ruatapu used Uenuku's own hairpiece, believing himself to be the senior son, as the eldest, when in fact Kahutiaterangi was the senior son owing to a difference in lineage. Ruatapu then went away and built his own large canoe that could hold 140 people. Once finished he announced that he would set off in it, and then killed everyone aboard with a spear, save for Paikea, who took to the ocean and was saved by the gods.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/ngai-tahu/page-1|title=Early history [of Ng\u0101i Tahu]|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn yet another telling says that Chief Uenuku made a canoe for the nobility and was preparing the hair of all 70 of his noble children for their first sail inside of it. Uenuku himself, combed, oiled, and tied the hair of every last one of them, except Ruatapu. When Ruatapu asked why his father had not treated his hair, Uenuku told him he could not because he was the only son of a slave woman, and his hair was not tapu like his brothers'. This put Ruatapu to shame, and so he refused to eat dinner that night, instead going down to the canoe and putting a hole in its bottom, before filling it with wood chips and hiding the canoe's bailer. In the morning when they launched the canoe, Ruatapu hid the hole with his heel. When they were far out at sea he released the hole and removed the chips. The water rushed in, and nobody could find the bailer as Ruatapu had hidden it on shore. Everybody drowned, except Paikea, who was saved through his mother's ancestor [[Tangaroa]] who summoned the whale. Ruatapu's last attempt at killing Paikea was to use an incantation to hurl waves at him. This backfired as Paikea was too far away now, and the waves just rolled back onto Ruatapu thus drowning him.<ref name=\"TeAo\">{{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao40TeA/c5.html|title=The Story of Paikea and Ruatapu|publisher=Te Puna M\u0101tauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ng\u0101ti Porou tradition===\nIn a tradition of Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutiaterangi ahead of him in status.
