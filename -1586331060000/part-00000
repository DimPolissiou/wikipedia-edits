[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.By this time the world was at world war 2.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Gibb (1982) pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryParkes Melbourne.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Sir Henry Parkes delivering the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, 1 March 1890]]\n\nIn 1890, representatives of the six colonies and New Zealand had met in Melbourne and called for the union of the colonies and for the colonial legislatures to nominate representatives to attend a constitutional convention. The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. Western Australia voted to join in July 1900. The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' was passed by the British parliament on 5 July 1900 and given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Queen Victoria]] on 9 July 1900.<ref>R.

From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. The first [[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the [[Protectionist Party]] over the [[Free Trade Party]] with the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) polling third.

In Western Australia, Forrest introduced a conciliation and arbitration bill in 1900 which brought trade unions into the state's social fabric for the first time. In addition, WA Labor scored another victory with the passage of legislation which extended workers' compensation.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek]] and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Unable to secure their support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as Prime Minister.

Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of General MacArthur, who became \"Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific\". Curtin had thus presided over a fundamental shift in Australia's foreign policy. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Gibb (1982) pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryParkes Melbourne.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Sir Henry Parkes delivering the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, 1 March 1890]]\n\nIn 1890, representatives of the six colonies and New Zealand had met in Melbourne and called for the union of the colonies and for the colonial legislatures to nominate representatives to attend a constitutional convention. The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. Western Australia voted to join in July 1900. The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' was passed by the British parliament on 5 July 1900 and given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Queen Victoria]] on 9 July 1900.<ref>R.

From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. The first [[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the [[Protectionist Party]] over the [[Free Trade Party]] with the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) polling third.

In Western Australia, Forrest introduced a conciliation and arbitration bill in 1900 which brought trade unions into the state's social fabric for the first time. In addition, WA Labor scored another victory with the passage of legislation which extended workers' compensation.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek]] and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Unable to secure their support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as Prime Minister.

Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of General MacArthur, who became \"Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific\". Curtin had thus presided over a fundamental shift in Australia's foreign policy. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia.

Herald and His Moving Comics''''', more commonly known as '''''Little Nemo''''' is a 1911 [[silent film|silent]] [[animation|animated]] [[short film]] by American cartoonist [[Winsor McCay]].  One of the earliest animated films, it was McCay's first, and featured characters from McCay's comic strip ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''.  Its expressive [[character animation]] distinguished the film from the experiments of [[History of animation|earlier animators]].\n\nInspired by [[flip book]]s his son brought home, McCay came to see the potential of the animated film medium.  He claimed to be the first to make such films, though [[James Stuart Blackton]] and [[\u00c9mile Cohl]] were among those who preceded him.  The short's four thousand drawings on [[rice paper]] were shot at [[Vitagraph Studios]] under Blackton's supervision.  Most of the film's running time is made up of a live-action sequence in which McCay bets his colleagues that he can make drawings that move.  He wins the bet with four minutes of animation in which the ''Little Nemo'' characters perform, interact, and metamorphose to McCay's whim.\n\n''Little Nemo'' debuted in movie theaters on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his [[vaudeville]] act.  Its good reception motivated him to [[Hand-colouring of photographs|hand-color]] each of the animated frames of the original black-and-white film. The film's success led McCay to devote more time to animation.  He followed up ''Little Nemo'' with ''[[How a Mosquito Operates]]'' in 1912 and his best-known film, ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', in 1914.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=1:10|alt=Black-and-white film, animated in chalk, showing continuous transformations of images|[[James Stuart Blackton]] used chalk drawings to animate ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906).]]\n\n[[Winsor McCay]] ({{circa|1867\u201371}}&nbsp;\u2013 1934){{efn|Different accounts have given McCay's birth year as 1867, 1869, and 1871.

Cohl's films were first distributed in the United States in 1909, the year McCay said he first became interested in animation.  According to McCay biographer [[John Canemaker]], McCay combined the interactive qualities of Blackton's films with the abstract, shapeshifting qualities of Cohl's into his own films.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  In the films of all three, the artist interacts with the animation.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=109}}\n\n===Little Nemo===\n\n{{main|Little Nemo}}\n\nConsidered McCay's masterpiece,{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1994|1p=21|2a1=Hubbard|2y=2012|3a1=Sabin|3y=1993|3p=134|4a1=Dover editors|4y=1973|4p=vii|5a1=Canwell|5y=2009|5p=19}} ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'' debuted in October 1905 as a full-page [[Sunday comics|Sunday strip]] in the ''[[New York Herald]]''.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}}  Its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert,{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=97}} had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel.

The words \"Watch me move\" appear above Flip's head, and he begins to make gestures while smoking his cigar.

Nemo prevents the two others from fighting and takes control of their forms\u2014he stretches and squashes them with the raising and lowering of his arms.  Nemo then draws the Princess and brings her to animated life.  He gives her a rose which has suddenly grown nearby, just as a gigantic dragon appears.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=161}}  The pair seat themselves on a throne in the dragon's mouth{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=117}} and wave to the audience as the dragon carries them away.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=161}}\n\nFlip and Impie attempt to follow the dragon in a [[Decrepit car|jalopy]], but the car explodes and sends them into the air.

McCay included the film as part of his [[vaudeville]] act beginning April 12.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  ''Little Nemo'' was popular with audiences and earned positive reviews.  Film magazine ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' called ''Nemo'' \"an admirable piece of work&nbsp;... one of those films which have a natural advertising heritage in the great and wide popularity of its subject\u2014Little Nemo is known everywhere.\"  ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' called McCay's new film-enhanced act \"even a greater go than his previous one\", and put McCay on its \"Blue List\" of vaudeville \"Actors and Acts of the Highest Ratings\".{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=163}}  In 1938 architect [[Claude Fayette Bragdon|Claude Bragdon]] reminisced of the excitement he felt when he saw ''Little Nemo'', saying he \"had witnessed the birth of a new art\".{{sfnm|1a1=Bragdon|1y=1938|1p=49|2a1=Canemaker|2y=2005|2p=163}}  ''Nemo'' appeared on stage and in theaters within the same week, but McCay postponed the theatrical releases of his next two films, ''[[How a Mosquito Operates]]'' (1912) and ''Gertie the Dinosaur'' (1914), for some time after he used them in his stage show.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|p=10}}\n\nAnimation historian Giannalberto Bendazzi saw the transforming series of images in the plotless ''Nemo'' serving as little more than a demonstration of the animation medium's capabilities.  Bendazzi wrote that McCay overcame this overt experimentalism in ''How a Mosquito Operates''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}}\n\nMcCay's working method was laborious, and animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films.  Within a few years of ''Nemo''{{'}}s release, Canadian [[Raoul Barr\u00e9]]'s registration pegs combined with American [[Earl Hurd]]'s [[cel]] technology became near-universal methods in animation studios.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=10\u201314}}  In 1916, McCay himself adopted the cel method, beginning with his fourth film ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]'' (1918).{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|pp=188,

Herald and His Moving Comics''''', more commonly known as '''''Little Nemo''''' is a 1911 [[silent film|silent]] [[animation|animated]] [[short film]] by American cartoonist [[Winsor McCay]].  One of the earliest animated films, it was McCay's first, and featured characters from McCay's comic strip ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''.  Its expressive [[character animation]] distinguished the film from the experiments of [[History of animation|earlier animators]].\n\nInspired by [[flip book]]s his son brought home, McCay came to see the potential of the animated film medium.  He claimed to be the first to make such films, though [[James Stuart Blackton]] and [[\u00c9mile Cohl]] were among those who preceded him.  The short's four thousand drawings on [[rice paper]] were shot at [[Vitagraph Studios]] under Blackton's supervision.  Most of the film's running time is made up of a live-action sequence in which McCay bets his colleagues that he can make drawings that move.  He wins the bet with four minutes of animation in which the ''Little Nemo'' characters perform, interact, and metamorphose to McCay's whim.\n\n''Little Nemo'' debuted in movie theaters on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his [[vaudeville]] act.  Its good reception motivated him to [[Hand-colouring of photographs|hand-color]] each of the animated frames of the original black-and-white film. The film's success led McCay to devote more time to animation.  He followed up ''Little Nemo'' with ''[[How a Mosquito Operates]]'' in 1912 and his best-known film, ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', in 1914.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=1:10|alt=Black-and-white film, animated in chalk, showing continuous transformations of images|[[James Stuart Blackton]] used chalk drawings to animate ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906).]]\n\n[[Winsor McCay]] ({{circa|1867\u201371}}&nbsp;\u2013 1934){{efn|Different accounts have given McCay's birth year as 1867, 1869, and 1871.

Cohl's films were first distributed in the United States in 1909, the year McCay said he first became interested in animation.  According to McCay biographer [[John Canemaker]], McCay combined the interactive qualities of Blackton's films with the abstract, shapeshifting qualities of Cohl's into his own films.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  In the films of all three, the artist interacts with the animation.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=109}}\n\n===Little Nemo===\n\n{{main|Little Nemo}}\n\nConsidered McCay's masterpiece,{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1994|1p=21|2a1=Hubbard|2y=2012|3a1=Sabin|3y=1993|3p=134|4a1=Dover editors|4y=1973|4p=vii|5a1=Canwell|5y=2009|5p=19}} ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'' debuted in October 1905 as a full-page [[Sunday comics|Sunday strip]] in the ''[[New York Herald]]''.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}}  Its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert,{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=97}} had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel.

Doctor Pill arrives to help, but cannot find anyone until Flip and Impie land on him.  The pair try to help the doctor to his feet when the animation freezes.  The camera zooms out to reveal the serial number \"No. 4000\", and a thumb holding the drawing.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=117}}{{Clear}}\n\n==Production==\n\nBy late 1910, McCay had made the 4000 [[Rice paper|rice-paper]] drawings for the animated portion of the film.  Each was assigned a serial number, and marks were made in the top corners for [[Printing registration|registration]].  They were mounted on sheets of cardboard to make them easier to handle and photograph.  Before he had them photographed, he tested them on a hand-cranked {{convert|24|*|12|*|20|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Mutoscope]]-like machine to ensure the animation was fluid.  Photography was done at the [[Vitagraph Studios]] under the supervision of Blackton.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=161}}  In only one sequence did McCay use an [[Traditional animation#Animation loops|animation loop]] for a repeated action: he re-used a series of seven drawings six times (three forward, three back) to have Flip move his cigar up and down in his mouth three times.  McCay made more extensive use of this technique in his later films.{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=24}}\n\n==Style==\n\n[[File:Little Nemo film still - McCay sketching Impie Nemo and Flip.jpg|thumb|alt=Film still of a hand sketching three cartoon characters|Winsor McCay sketches three of his ''[[Little Nemo]]'' characters: Impie, Nemo, and Flip.]]\n\nMcCay's drawings are in the heavily outlined [[Art Nouveau]] style familiar to the readers of his comics.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=111}}  Its expressive [[character animation]]  differentiated ''Little Nemo'' from the films of Blackton and Cohl.{{sfn|Crafton|2005|p=28}}  There are no backgrounds; McCay's first film with backgrounds was 1914's ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=114}}  McCay demonstrated his mastery of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]] in scenes such as when the dragon disappears smoothly into the distance.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=117}}\n\nThe film's positive reception motivated McCay to hand-color each of the 35mm frames of the originally black-and-white film.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=163}}  The dragon chariot that carries off Nemo and the Princess originally appeared in three episodes of ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' in mid-1906.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=123}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nDistributed by Vitagraph, the film debuted in theaters on April 8, 1911.  McCay included the film as part of his [[vaudeville]] act beginning April 12.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  ''Little Nemo'' was popular with audiences and earned positive reviews.  Film magazine ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' called ''Nemo'' \"an admirable piece of work&nbsp;... one of those films which have a natural advertising heritage in the great and wide popularity of its subject\u2014Little Nemo is known everywhere.\"  ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' called McCay's new film-enhanced act \"even a greater go than his previous one\", and put McCay on its \"Blue List\" of vaudeville \"Actors and Acts of the Highest Ratings\".{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=163}}  In 1938 architect [[Claude Fayette Bragdon|Claude Bragdon]] reminisced of the excitement he felt when he saw ''Little Nemo'', saying he \"had witnessed the birth of a new art\".{{sfnm|1a1=Bragdon|1y=1938|1p=49|2a1=Canemaker|2y=2005|2p=163}}  ''Nemo'' appeared on stage and in theaters within the same week, but McCay postponed the theatrical releases of his next two films, ''[[How a Mosquito Operates]]'' (1912) and ''Gertie the Dinosaur'' (1914), for some time after he used them in his stage show.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|p=10}}\n\nAnimation historian Giannalberto Bendazzi saw the transforming series of images in the plotless ''Nemo'' serving as little more than a demonstration of the animation medium's capabilities.  Bendazzi wrote that McCay overcame this overt experimentalism in ''How a Mosquito Operates''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}}\n\nMcCay's working method was laborious, and animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films.  Within a few years of ''Nemo''{{'}}s release, Canadian [[Raoul Barr\u00e9]]'s registration pegs combined with American [[Earl Hurd]]'s [[cel]] technology became near-universal methods in animation studios.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=10\u201314}}  In 1916, McCay himself adopted the cel method, beginning with his fourth film ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]'' (1918).{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|pp=188, 193}}\n\nIn 2009, ''Little Nemo'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-250.html|title=Michael Jackson, the Muppets and Early Cinema Tapped for Preservation in 2009 Library of Congress National Film

The party mainly followed a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] and nationalist political agenda throughout the latter half of the 20th century, but later moderated its views under the leadership of [[Devlet Bah\u00e7eli]], who took over after T\u00fcrke\u015f's death in 1997. The party's youth wing is the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Gray Wolves]] (''Bozkurtlar'') organization, which is also known as the \"Nationalist Hearths\" (''\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131'').{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} T\u00fcrke\u015f, who is widely revered by Turkish nationalists as the founder of the idealist movement, is commonly referred to as \"Chieftain\" (''Ba\u015fbu\u011f'') by his supporters.\n\nAlparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f founded the party after criticizing the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) for moving too far away from the nationalist principles of their founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], claiming that he would not have founded the MHP had the CHP not deviated from Atat\u00fcrk's ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulkuocaklari.org.tr/biz-kimiz-saday-alisov.html|title=Biz Kimiz? \u2013 Ahmet \u015eefki Kuzulu - \u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131 E\u011fitim ve K\u00fclt\u00fcr Vakf\u0131}}</ref> Although T\u00fcrke\u015f failed to win any elections, the MHP won enough seats in the [[1973 Turkish general election|1973]] and [[1977 Turkish general election|1977 general election]] to take part in two coalition governments led by [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] (AP) leader [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]]. T\u00fcrke\u015f served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey]] between 1975 and 1977 in what was referred to as the [[39th government of Turkey|First Nationalist Front]] government and again between 1977 and 1978 in the [[41st government of Turkey|Second Nationalist Front]]. After T\u00fcrke\u015f's death and the [[1997 Nationalist Movement Party Extraordinary Congress|election]] of Devlet Bah\u00e7eli as his successor, the party moderated its views and adopted a more mainstream nationalist agenda. The party under Bah\u00e7eli's leadership won 18% of the vote and 129 seats in the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its best ever result, coming second only to the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]] (DSP). Bah\u00e7eli subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister after [[57th government of Turkey|entering a coalition]] with the DSP and the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] (ANAP), though his calls for an early election resulted in the government's collapse in 2002. In the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 general election]], the MHP fell below the 10% [[election threshold]] and lost all of its parliamentary representation after the newly formed [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) won a plurality.\n\nSince the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]], in which the MHP won back its parliamentary representation with 14.27% of the vote and 71 seats, the party has strongly opposed the [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] between the government and Kurdish separatist militants and has been fiercely critical of the governing AKP over government corruption and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, the MHP has often been referred to critics as the \"AKP's lifeline\", having either openly or covertly helped the AKP in situations such as the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]], repealing the headscarf ban and the [[Turkish Parliament Speaker election, June\u2013July 2015|June\u2013July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/levent-gok-mhpnin-akpye-can-simidi-olduguna-herkes-tanik-oldu-124609|title=Levent G\u00f6k: MHP'nin, AKP'ye can simidi oldu\u011funa herkes tan\u0131k oldu|date=30 July 2015}}</ref> In the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]], the party's vote fell to 13% and won 53 seats, though increased to 16.3% and 80 seats in the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Having consistently maintained third-party status in Parliament since 2007, the MHP halved its parliamentary representation to win 40 seats with 11.9% of the vote in the [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015 general election]], becoming the fourth largest party in Parliament behind the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP).

The MHP said these policies would allow a minimum wage earner living in a big city to earn as much an extra $646 annually.\n\nThe MHP stated that their economic policies would create 700,000 jobs, increase the national income per person to $13.3K, and increase exports to $238 billion while keeping annual growth at 5.2 percent between 2016 and 2019.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn July 2015, amidst [[Xinjiang conflict#2015 anti-China protests in Turkey|a wave of protests]] against the [[Xinjiang conflict]], MHP-affiliated ''[[\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131|\u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc]]'' attacked [[South Korea]]n tourists on Istanbul's [[Sultanahmet Square]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> In an interview to Turkish columnist [[Ahmet Hakan]], MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli played the attacks down,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ahmet Hakan |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015|author-link=Ahmet Hakan }}</ref> stating that \"These are young kids.

The party mainly followed a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] and nationalist political agenda throughout the latter half of the 20th century, but later moderated its views under the leadership of [[Devlet Bah\u00e7eli]], who took over after T\u00fcrke\u015f's death in 1997.

T\u00fcrke\u015f served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey]] between 1975 and 1977 in what was referred to as the [[39th government of Turkey|First Nationalist Front]] government and again between 1977 and 1978 in the [[41st government of Turkey|Second Nationalist Front]]. After T\u00fcrke\u015f's death and the [[1997 Nationalist Movement Party Extraordinary Congress|election]] of Devlet Bah\u00e7eli as his successor, the party moderated its views and adopted a more mainstream nationalist agenda. The party under Bah\u00e7eli's leadership won 18% of the vote and 129 seats in the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its best ever result, coming second only to the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]] (DSP). Bah\u00e7eli subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister after [[57th government of Turkey|entering a coalition]] with the DSP and the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] (ANAP), though his calls for an early election resulted in the government's collapse in 2002. In the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 general election]], the MHP fell below the 10% [[election threshold]] and lost all of its parliamentary representation after the newly formed [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) won a plurality.\n\nSince the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]], in which the MHP won back its parliamentary representation with 14.27% of the vote and 71 seats, the party has strongly opposed the [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] between the government and Kurdish separatist militants and has been fiercely critical of the governing AKP over government corruption and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, the MHP has often been referred to critics as the \"AKP's lifeline\", having either openly or covertly helped the AKP in situations such as the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]], repealing the headscarf ban and the [[Turkish Parliament Speaker election, June\u2013July 2015|June\u2013July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/levent-gok-mhpnin-akpye-can-simidi-olduguna-herkes-tanik-oldu-124609|title=Levent G\u00f6k: MHP'nin, AKP'ye can simidi oldu\u011funa herkes tan\u0131k oldu|date=30 July 2015}}</ref> In the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]], the party's vote fell to 13% and won 53 seats, though increased to 16.3% and 80 seats in the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Having consistently maintained third-party status in Parliament since 2007, the MHP halved its parliamentary representation to win 40 seats with 11.9% of the vote in the [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015 general election]], becoming the fourth largest party in Parliament behind the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP).

The MHP said these policies would allow a minimum wage earner living in a big city to earn as much an extra $646 annually.\n\nThe MHP stated that their economic policies would create 700,000 jobs, increase the national income per person to $13.3K, and increase exports to $238 billion while keeping annual growth at 5.2 percent between 2016 and 2019.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn July 2015, amidst [[Xinjiang conflict#2015 anti-China protests in Turkey|a wave of protests]] against the [[Xinjiang conflict]], MHP-affiliated ''[[\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131|\u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc]]'' attacked [[South Korea]]n tourists on Istanbul's [[Sultanahmet Square]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> In an interview to Turkish columnist [[Ahmet Hakan]], MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli played the attacks down,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ahmet Hakan |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015|author-link=Ahmet Hakan }}</ref> stating that \"These are young kids.

During a later press conference, it was revealed that MET was offset by 11 hours.  When it became obvious that the maneuver did not happen, NASA and Boeing tried sending commands to get Starliner back on track, but the position of the spacecraft switching communications between two [[TDRS]] satellites made the maneuver misfire inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This resulted in an abort in ISS rendezvous. The decision was made by NASA and Boeing since the spacecraft burned too much fuel to reach the ISS even after Mission Control fixed the MET clock issue.

After deorbiting, Starliner reentered the Earth's atmosphere before successfully deploying all sets of parachutes. Starliner deployed airbags and successfully touched-down at [[White Sands Missile Range]] at 7:58 AM ET.  Though the ISS rendezvous that was planned for the OFT did not happen, [[Jim Chilton]], vice president for Boeing\u2019s space and launch division, estimated that Starliner has achieved over 60% of the flight objectives, and this could reach over 85% once all the data from the spacecraft is retrieved and analyzed.<ref>https://spacenews.com/starliner-lands-in-new-mexico/</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft will later be reused on mission [[USCV-2]]. Its commander, [[Sunita Williams]], informally dubbed the spacecraft \u201cCalypso\u201d after the [[RV Calypso|famed oceanographic research ship]] and its eponymous John Denver song.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Astro_Suni |number=1208780116630876160 |date=December 22, 2019 |title=Thanking two mission control personnel |last=Williams|first=Sunita}}</ref>\n\n== Anomalies ==\nAn issue with the spacecraft's [[mission elapsed time]] (MET) clock occurred 31 minutes into flight. This anomaly caused the spacecraft to burn into an incorrect orbit, preventing a rendezvous with the ISS. The mission was reduced to just two days, with the spacecraft successfully landing at [[White Sands Missile Range]] on 22 December. After the mission it was revealed that another critical software bug was found in flight, which could have resulted in the [[service module]] bumping back into Starliner after separation. If this had occurred, it may have damaged Starliner and prevented a safe landing. Additionally it was determined that had the first anomaly not occurred, the second would not have been detected. While the mission completed some test objectives, NASA and Boeing are investigating the two anomalies to determine if another uncrewed test flight is needed before Starliner can launch passengers.\n\nOn 7 February 2020, NASA shared their preliminary findings about the Boeing OFT mission and discovered software problems with the Mission Elapsed Timer (MET), which incorrectly polled time from the Atlas V booster nearly 11 hours prior to launch. Another software issue occurred within the Service Module (SM) Disposal Sequence, which incorrectly translated the SM disposal sequence into the SM Integrated Propulsion Controller (IPC). This could have made the service module crash into the capsule after separation, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure of the capsule. In addition an Intermittent Space-to-Ground (S/G) forward link issue, which impeded the Flight Control team's ability to command and control the vehicle, was found. The current investigation is expected to last until end of February, in addition a full-scale safety review is planned that will likely take months.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/07/tech/boeing-starliner-software-commercial-crew-ssn/index.html|title=Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, built to carry astronauts, faces new safety concerns|date=February 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/boeings-starliner-problems-may-be-worse-than-we-thought/|title=Boeing\u2019s Starliner problems may be worse than we thought|date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Dragon 2|Crew Dragon]]\n*[[Crew Dragon Demo-1]], SpaceX's first (uncrewed) orbital mission for a capsule intended to carry crew.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.boeing.com/space/starliner/ Official Webpage of the CST-100 Starliner] \n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg NASA Live: Official Stream of NASA TV]\n\n{{Starliner spaceflights}}\n{{Unmanned ISS flights}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019]]\n[[Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019]]\n[[Category:December 2019 events in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect-distinguish|Rosie the Rocketeer|Rosie the Rocketer}}\n{{Infobox spaceflight\n| name = Boe-OFT\n| image =Boeing Orbital Flight Test.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Atlas V]] lifts off carrying Starliner for OFT\n| mission_type = Test flight\n| operator = {{Hlist|[[NASA]]|[[Boeing]]}}\n| COSPAR_ID = \n| SATCAT = 44900\n| mission_duration = {{time interval|2019-12-20 11:36:43|2019-12-22 12:58:53|show=dhms|sep=,}}\n| distance_travelled = \n| orbits_completed = 33<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzNHeX7OYM Boeing Starliner Orbital Flight Test Landing]</ref>\n| spacecraft = ''Calypso''<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Astro_Suni |number=1208780116630876160 |date=December 22, 2019 |title=Thanking two mission control personnel |last=Williams|first=Sunita}}</ref>\n| spacecraft_type = [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner|CST-100 Starliner]]\n| manufacturer = [[Boeing]]\n| launch_mass = {{convert|NNNN|abbr=on}}\n| landing_mass = {{convert|NNNN|abbr=on}}\n| launch_date = 20 December 2019 11:36:43 UTC<ref name=\"sfn-20191203\">{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/12/03/launch-of-starliner-test-flight-slips-to-dec-19/ |title=Launch of first Starliner orbital test flight slips to Dec. 19 |work=Spaceflight Now |date=3 December 2019 |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=SPFN>[https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/12/18/atlas-5-av-080-starliner-oft-mission-status-center/ Live coverage: Overnight countdown underway for Friday\u2019s Starliner launch]</ref>\n| launch_rocket = [[Atlas V]] N22 (AV-080)\n| launch_site = [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|SLC-41]]\n| landing_date = 22 December 2019 12:58:53 UTC\n| landing_site = [[White Sands Missile Range]]\n| apsis = gee\n| orbit_epoch = \n| orbit_reference = [[geocentric orbit|Geocentric]]\n| orbit_regime = [[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth]]\n| orbit_periapsis = \n| orbit_apoapsis = \n| orbit_period = \n| orbit_inclination = 51.6\n| insignia = [[File:Boeing Orbital Flight Test.png|frameless|upright=0.4]]\n| insignia_alt = Boeing insignia, featuring the Starliner and a docking port above a wreath representing the Earth's horizon\n| programme = '''[[Commercial Crew Development]]'''\n| previous_mission = [[Boeing Pad Abort Test]]\n| next_mission = [[Dragon 2 In-Flight Abort Test]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Boeing Orbital Flight Test''' (also known as '''Boe-OFT''') was the first orbital mission of the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner|CST-100 Starliner]] spacecraft, conducted by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing]] as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew Program]].

The dual-engine Centaur utilizes two [[RL10|RL10s]] and is required for Starliner flights in order to provide a launch trajectory that allows for a safe abort at any point in the mission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/11/starliner-arrives-launch-pad-major-milestone/|title=Starliner arrives at launch pad in major pre-flight milestone|date=2019-11-21|website=NASASpaceFlight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe mission launched successfully on 20 December 2019 at 6:36:43{{nbsp}}am EST,{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} but thirty-one minutes after launch the mission elapsed timer (MET) clock made an error and forced an abort to the ISS. During a later press conference, it was revealed that MET was offset by 11 hours.  When it became obvious that the maneuver did not happen, NASA and Boeing tried sending commands to get Starliner back on track, but the position of the spacecraft switching communications between two [[TDRS]] satellites made the maneuver misfire inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This resulted in an abort in ISS rendezvous. The decision was made by NASA and Boeing since the spacecraft burned too much fuel to reach the ISS even after Mission Control fixed the MET clock issue. NASA and Boeing officials placed the spacecraft in a different orbit and the entire flight plan had to be redone and the mission was reduced from eight days to three flight days.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy 7:40{{nbsp}}am EST, the Starliner was in a \"stable orbit\", though orbital insertion was not nominal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boeing, ULA launches of Starliner, suffers orbital insertion issue |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/12/boeing-ula-momentous-starliner-uncrewed-test-flight/ |work=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> It was later confirmed that Starliner had placed itself into a 187 x 222 km orbit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cgbassa/status/1208019783242911746|title=There's a second set of orbital elements released now. 187 x 222 km, with epoch at 13:20UTC.|last=Bassa|first=Cees|date=2019-12-20|website=@cgbassa|language=en|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> \n\nBy 8:55{{nbsp}}am EST, mission control had realized that docking with the ISS was precluded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1208021843388633090|title=Because #Starliner believed it was in an orbital insertion burn (or that the burn was complete), the dead bands were reduced and the spacecraft burned more fuel than anticipated to maintain precise control.

After deorbiting, Starliner reentered the Earth's atmosphere before successfully deploying all sets of parachutes. Starliner deployed airbags and successfully touched-down at [[White Sands Missile Range]] at 7:58 AM ET.  Though the ISS rendezvous that was planned for the OFT did not happen, [[Jim Chilton]], vice president for Boeing\u2019s space and launch division, estimated that Starliner has achieved over 60% of the flight objectives, and this could reach over 85% once all the data from the spacecraft is retrieved and analyzed.<ref>https://spacenews.com/starliner-lands-in-new-mexico/</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft will later be reused on mission [[USCV-2]]. Its commander, [[Sunita Williams]], informally dubbed the spacecraft \u201cCalypso\u201d after the [[RV Calypso|famed oceanographic research ship]] and its eponymous John Denver song.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Astro_Suni |number=1208780116630876160 |date=December 22, 2019 |title=Thanking two mission control personnel |last=Williams|first=Sunita}}</ref>\n\n== Anomalies ==\nAn issue with the spacecraft's [[mission elapsed time]] (MET) clock occurred 31 minutes into flight. This anomaly caused the spacecraft to burn into an incorrect orbit, preventing a rendezvous with the ISS. The mission was reduced to just two days, with the spacecraft successfully landing at [[White Sands Missile Range]] on 22 December. After the mission it was revealed that another critical software bug was found in flight, which could have resulted in the [[service module]] bumping back into Starliner after separation. If this had occurred, it may have damaged Starliner and prevented a safe landing. Additionally it was determined that had the first anomaly not occurred, the second would not have been detected. While the mission completed some test objectives, NASA and Boeing are investigating the two anomalies to determine if another uncrewed test flight is needed before Starliner can launch passengers.\n\nOn 7 February 2020, NASA shared their preliminary findings about the Boeing OFT mission and discovered software problems with the Mission Elapsed Timer (MET), which incorrectly polled time from the Atlas V booster nearly 11 hours prior to launch. Another software issue occurred within the Service Module (SM) Disposal Sequence, which incorrectly translated the SM disposal sequence into the SM Integrated Propulsion Controller (IPC). This could have made the service module crash into the capsule after separation, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure of the capsule. In addition an Intermittent Space-to-Ground (S/G) forward link issue, which impeded the Flight Control team's ability to command and control the vehicle, was found. The current investigation is expected to last until end of February, in addition a full-scale safety review is planned that will likely take months.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/07/tech/boeing-starliner-software-commercial-crew-ssn/index.html|title=Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, built to carry astronauts, faces new safety concerns|date=February 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/boeings-starliner-problems-may-be-worse-than-we-thought/|title=Boeing\u2019s Starliner problems may be worse than we thought|date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Dragon 2|Crew Dragon]]\n*[[Crew Dragon Demo-1]], SpaceX's first (uncrewed) orbital mission for a capsule intended to carry crew.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.boeing.com/space/starliner/ Official Webpage of the CST-100 Starliner] \n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg NASA Live: Official Stream of NASA TV]\n\n{{Starliner spaceflights}}\n{{Unmanned ISS flights}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019]]\n[[Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019]]\n[[Category:December 2019 events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Toby6250", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test"}
