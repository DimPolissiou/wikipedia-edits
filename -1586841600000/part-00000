{"title_page": "Paschasius Radbertus", "text_new": "[[Saint]] '''Paschasius Radbertus''' (785\u2013865) was a [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] theologian and the abbot of [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]], a monastery in [[Picardy]] founded in 657 or 660 by the queen regent [[Bathilde]]  with a founding community of monks from [[Luxeuil Abbey]]. His most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the [[Eucharist]] written around 831, entitled ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''. \nHe was canonized in 1073 by [[Pope Gregory VII]]. His [[feast day]] is April 26. \nHis works are edited in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol. 120 (1852) and his important tract on the Eucharist, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'', in a 1969 edition by B. Paulus, published by Brepols (Corpus Christianorum, Continuatio Mediaevalis 16).\n\n==Life==\nPaschasius was an orphan left on the steps of the convent of [[Notre-Dame de Soissons]].  He was raised by the nuns there, and became very fond of the abbess, Theodrara.  Theodrara was sister of [[Adalard of Corbie]] and [[Wala of Corbie]], two monks whom he admired greatly.  At a fairly young age, Paschasius left the convent to serve as a monk under Abbot Adalard, at [[Corbie]].  There he also met Wala, Adalard's brother and successor.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/>  \n\nThrough the abbotship of both Adalard and Wala, Paschasius focused on the monastic life, spending his time studying and teaching. In 822 he accompanied abbot Adalard into Saxony for the purpose of founding the monastery of [[Princely Abbey of Corvey|New Corvey]] in Westphalia. When Adalard died in 826, Paschasius helped ensure Wala would become Abbot in his place. After Wala's death in 836 Heddo became abbot. [[Ratramnus]], who may have held the position of teaching master,<ref>Ginther, pp. 155-6.</ref> held opposing views to Paschasius on a number of ecclesiastical issues. Ratramnus wrote a refutation of Paschasius' treatise on the Eucharist, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'', using the same title.  \n\nIn 843 Paschasius succeeded Abbot Isaac, however he resigned his title ten years later to return to his studies.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 2-3</ref>  He left Corbie for the nearby monastery of [[Saint-Riquier]], where he lived in voluntary exile for some years. Why he resigned is unknown, however it is likely that his actions were motivated by factional disputes within his monastic community; misunderstandings between himself and the younger monks were likely factors in his decision. \nHe returned to Corbie late in life, and resided in his old monastery until his death in 865.<ref>Matter, pg. 149</ref>\n\nPaschasius' body was first buried at the Church of St. John in Corbie.  After numerous reported miracles,  the Pope ordered his remains to be removed, and interred in the Church of St. Peter, Corbie.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\n===''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''===\nThe most well-known and influential work of St. Paschasius, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'' (written between 831 and 833), is an exposition on the nature of the [[Eucharist]]. It was originally written as an instructional manual for the monks under his care at Corbie, and is the first lengthy treatise on the sacrament of the Eucharist in the Western world.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 5</ref> In it, Paschasius agrees with [[Ambrose]] in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true.  Christ's proclamation at the [[Last Supper]] that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 9</ref>  He thus believes that the [[transubstantiation]] of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs.  Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10</ref>  \n\nPaschasius believed that the presence of the historical blood and body of Christ allows the partaker a real union with Jesus in a direct, personal, and physical union by joining a person's flesh with Christ's and Christ's flesh with his.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10-11</ref>  To Paschasius, the Eucharist's transformation into the flesh and blood of Christ is possible because of the principle that God is truth;  God is able to manipulate nature, as he created it.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 12</ref> The book was given to [[Charles the Bald]], the Frankish king, as a present in 844, with the inclusion of a special introduction. The view Paschasius expressed in this work was met with some hostility; [[Ratramnus]] wrote a rebuttal by the same name, by order of [[Charles the Bald]], who did not agree with some of the views Paschasius held.  Ratramnus believed that the Eucharist was strictly metaphorical; he focused more on the relationship between faith and the newly emerging science. Shortly thereafter, a third monk joined the debate, [[Rabanus Maurus]], which initiated the Carolingian Eucharist Controversy.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 1</ref> Ultimately, however, the king accepted Paschasius' assertion, and the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|substantial presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] became the authoritative belief in the Roman Catholic faith.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 3</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#C0C0C0; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" \n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When I begin to think about [Adalard], I am inwardly affected by two contrary emotions, namely, grief, and joy.  The Apostle forbids us to mourn in such a situation, but my and our sudden desolation prevents us from rejoicing.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Paschasius Radbertus, ''Vita Adalhardi''\n|}\n\n===''Vitae Adalhardi et Walae''===\nWritten in 826 and 836, respectively, ''Vita Adalhardi'' and ''Vita Walae'' are spiritual biographies of Paschasius' role-models.  They are personal tributes, written for the memory of two fathers, and the patterns of life depicted in them are intended to be followed.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 14</ref>\n\n''Vita Adalhardi'' is rather brief; it is a fairly conventional representation of a saint's life. However, the style that Paschasius uses is unique for the time in which it was written. Written in mourning for the loss of his friend, Paschasius compares Adalard to the painter [[Zeuxis]]. As described by [[Cicero]], artists study models to perfect their art; Zeuxis' challenge was to paint the woman, [[Helen of Troy]].  Paschasius states that just as Zeuxis studied forms in order to perfect his art, so too does Adalard in trying to reform the image of God in himself. In making this comparison, Paschasius was identified with being a [[humanistic]] writer of the Carolingian period, as he compared classic and ancient literature with contemporary literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 1-2</ref> Paschasius depicts Adalard as a mirror image of Christ, emphasizing the elements of infinite love and descent into suffering.<ref>Appleby, pg. 7</ref>  He also parallels Adalard's role in the Church to that of a mother, which is a concept attributed to [[Cistercian]] spirituality in the 12th century, three hundred years after Paschasius' death.  The grief felt over the death of Adalard is extremely strong in the book \u2013 although Paschasius knows that suffering should give way to joy, as depicted by his forefathers, such as [[Jerome]], Paschasius' grief for the loss of his friend surpassed that of his literary models.  This style of writing is also not seen elsewhere prior to the 12th century.  Paschasius' justification of excess mourning is his most distinctive contribution to the tradition of consolation literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 8-9</ref>\n\n''Vita Walae'' is much longer (about twice as long as ''Vita Adalhardi''), and is structured as a dialogue. In total, there are eight characters represented, presumably monks of Corbie.  These characters are given pseudonyms, probably nor with the intention of masking identities. It is more likely that these pseudonyms were employed to further support Paschasius' interpretation of Wala, as the names were taken from classical texts.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 20</ref> Phrases and passages from a variety of sources are woven into the text ([[Acts of St. Sebastien]], [[The Book of Job]], various comedies of [[Terence]]). Although not displaying information about Wala, these additions reflect Paschasius' own beliefs and his skill at writing.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 15</ref>  While ''Vita Adalhardi'' was written to be in part a funeral eulogy, ''Vita Walae'' was  written as a (fairly) accurate depiction of Wala.  Paschasius used sources in writing this biography, a handbook written by Wala, and treatises of the time, probably to show his own views through his depiction of Wala.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 16</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nPaschasius has an extensive collection of works, including many [[exegeses]] on various books of the [[Bible]].  He wrote commentaries on the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and an exposition of [[Psalm 45]], which he dedicated to the nuns at St. Mary at Soissons.  ''De Partu Virginis'', written for his friend Emma, Abbess of St. Mary at Soissons and daughter of Theodrara, describes the lifestyle of nuns.  He also wrote a treatise, titled ''De Nativitae Sanctae Mariae'', regarding the nature of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Paschasius probably wrote much more, but none of it has survived through the centuries.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 3</ref> Paschasius wrote a commentary on ''Revelation''.<ref>Brant James Pitre, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary (p. 62).</ref>\n\n==Theological contributions==\n\n===Understanding of the human body===\nIn opposition to other [[Carolingian]] authors, Paschasius locates the ''[[Imago Dei]]'' (the \"Image of God\") in the whole human being - body as well as soul. This view is in alignment with that of the second-century [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]]. Irenaeus believed that Jesus was the physical embodiment of God; the son is the image of the father. As such, humans represent the image of God not only in soul, but in flesh as well. This view is in opposition to the more accepted view of [[Origen of Alexandria]], who believed that the physical body had no part in the image-relationship.<ref>Appleby, pg. 14</ref> Unlike other theologians of the time, Paschasius does not equate the [[sanctification]] process with a metaphysical detachment of the body and the soul. Instead, he believes that the [[human condition]] (existing in a physical form) can contribute positively to achieving sanctification. However, he did believe in a form of mitigated dualism, in which the soul plays a larger part in the process than the body.<ref>Appleby, pg.15</ref> Paschasius believes that life is an opportunity to practice for death; however, the concept that the body is a prison for the soul is practically non-existent in his work, and probably only occurs due to pressure from his peers. Even though he believed that the body has a role in one's sanctification process, he also acknowledged that flesh struggles against God, and thus has the ability to be corrupted.<ref>Appleby, pg. 17</ref>\n\n===Understanding of Christ's body===\nPaschasius believes in a distinction between ''veritas'' (truth) and ''figura'' (form, or appearance). Christ's descent from Heaven to Earth was a declension from truth to appearance, from the realm of perfection to the realm of imperfection.<ref>Appleby, pg. 18</ref> This would imply that Jesus in flesh is false, and imperfect; however, Paschasius asserted that not every figure is false. Christ is simultaneously both truth and figure because his external, physical self is the figure of the truth, the physical manifestation of the truth that exists in the soul.<ref>Appleby, pg. 19</ref> The person that was Jesus was subject to human needs, just like the rest of humanity. He required to eat, to sleep, and to be in company with others. In addition to this, however, he also performed miracles. These behaviours which Jesus exhibited imply a duality in the concept of \"Word made flesh\". Miracles, until then only performed by God, the non-physical Truth or Word, were suddenly performed by a physical human being.<ref>Appleby, pg. 20</ref> The relationship between Jesus' humanity and his divinity is rather convoluted; however, it is analogous to the relation of figures (written letters) of words to their spoken counterparts. Therefore, Jesus in physical form is the visual representation, T-R-U-T-H, while his divinity is the spoken sound of those written letters together as a word.<ref>Appleby, pg. 16-17</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adalard of Corbie]]\n*[[Wala of Corbie]]\n*[[Ratramnus of Corbie]]\n*[[Charles the Bald]]\n*[[Rabanus Maurus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Radbertus, Paschausuis. \"The Lord\u2019s Body and Blood.\" Early Medieval Theology: The Library of Christian Classics.ed.

Although not displaying information about Wala, these additions reflect Paschasius' own beliefs and his skill at writing.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 15</ref>  While ''Vita Adalhardi'' was written to be in part a funeral eulogy, ''Vita Walae'' was  written as a (fairly) accurate depiction of Wala.  Paschasius used sources in writing this biography, a handbook written by Wala, and treatises of the time, probably to show his own views through his depiction of Wala.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 16</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nPaschasius has an extensive collection of works, including many [[exegeses]] on various books of the [[Bible]].  He wrote commentaries on the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and an exposition of [[Psalm 45]], which he dedicated to the nuns at St. Mary at Soissons.  ''De Partu Virginis'', written for his friend Emma, Abbess of St. Mary at Soissons and daughter of Theodrara, describes the lifestyle of nuns.  He also wrote a treatise, titled ''De Nativitae Sanctae Mariae'', regarding the nature of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Paschasius probably wrote much more, but none of it has survived through the centuries.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 3</ref> Paschasius wrote a commentary on Revelation<ref>Brant James Pitre, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary (p. 62).</ref>\n\n==Theological contributions==\n\n===Understanding of the human body===\nIn opposition to other [[Carolingian]] authors, Paschasius locates the ''[[Imago Dei]]'' (the \"Image of God\") in the whole human being - body as well as soul. This view is in alignment with that of the second-century [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]]. Irenaeus believed that Jesus was the physical embodiment of God; the son is the image of the father. As such, humans represent the image of God not only in soul, but in flesh as well. This view is in opposition to the more accepted view of [[Origen of Alexandria]], who believed that the physical body had no part in the image-relationship.<ref>Appleby, pg. 14</ref> Unlike other theologians of the time, Paschasius does not equate the [[sanctification]] process with a metaphysical detachment of the body and the soul. Instead, he believes that the [[human condition]] (existing in a physical form) can contribute positively to achieving sanctification. However, he did believe in a form of mitigated dualism, in which the soul plays a larger part in the process than the body.<ref>Appleby, pg.15</ref> Paschasius believes that life is an opportunity to practice for death; however, the concept that the body is a prison for the soul is practically non-existent in his work, and probably only occurs due to pressure from his peers. Even though he believed that the body has a role in one's sanctification process, he also acknowledged that flesh struggles against God, and thus has the ability to be corrupted.<ref>Appleby, pg. 17</ref>\n\n===Understanding of Christ's body===\nPaschasius believes in a distinction between ''veritas'' (truth) and ''figura'' (form, or appearance). Christ's descent from Heaven to Earth was a declension from truth to appearance, from the realm of perfection to the realm of imperfection.<ref>Appleby, pg. 18</ref> This would imply that Jesus in flesh is false, and imperfect; however, Paschasius asserted that not every figure is false. Christ is simultaneously both truth and figure because his external, physical self is the figure of the truth, the physical manifestation of the truth that exists in the soul.<ref>Appleby, pg. 19</ref> The person that was Jesus was subject to human needs, just like the rest of humanity. He required to eat, to sleep, and to be in company with others. In addition to this, however, he also performed miracles. These behaviours which Jesus exhibited imply a duality in the concept of \"Word made flesh\". Miracles, until then only performed by God, the non-physical Truth or Word, were suddenly performed by a physical human being.<ref>Appleby, pg. 20</ref> The relationship between Jesus' humanity and his divinity is rather convoluted; however, it is analogous to the relation of figures (written letters) of words to their spoken counterparts. Therefore, Jesus in physical form is the visual representation, T-R-U-T-H, while his divinity is the spoken sound of those written letters together as a word.<ref>Appleby, pg. 16-17</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adalard of Corbie]]\n*[[Wala of Corbie]]\n*[[Ratramnus of Corbie]]\n*[[Charles the Bald]]\n*[[Rabanus Maurus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Radbertus, Paschausuis. \"The Lord\u2019s Body and Blood.\" Early Medieval Theology: The Library of Christian Classics.ed.

They play in the [[Thai League 2]]. The club has previously played under the names of Royal Thai Navy FC, Rajnavi FC and Rajnavy Rayong FC.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was formed on 10 January 1956 as the '''Royal Thai Navy Football Club''' and currently plays under the name of '''Navy Football Club''', locally known as Rajnavy. The club has also played under the names of Rajnavi and Rajnavy Rayong, Rayong being the town they played in and the main base of the Navy in general.\n\nSince the inception of the Thai League in 1996 the club played under the name of the Royal Thai Navy up until 2009, when all teams in Thailand had to become public limited companies. With this, many teams changed names and formed closer links with the communities they were based in. In this case the Navy became known as Rajnavy Rayong. Rajnavy being the local Thai name for the Navy. In 2011, and with a dispute as to the ownership of the club, the club moved from their Rayong home and into the Chonburi province where they ground share with [[Pattaya United F.C.|Pattaya United]] \u2013 another club playing outside of their original home town \u2013 albeit against league rules, where two sides in the PLT cannot ground share.\n\n===Ownership dispute===\n\nIn 2009, when Thai football was becoming increasingly popular with all professional football teams told to properly register and become a company limited, the situation was almost to the point where anyone could register this football club for an ownership. At this point, Rayong Thai Premier took the ownership and renamed the club to Rajnavy Rayong. However, two seasons after that, the [[Royal Thai Navy]] decided to bring the team back under control and renamed it to Siam Navy. Thereafter, the football club moved from [[Rayong Province|Rayong]] to [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]], [[Chonburi Province|Chonburi]].\n\n===Turmoil===\n\nAt the start of the 2011 league campaign, with the Navy in a bit of turmoil after the dispute of the owner of the club, they proceeded to get it wrong on the field as well. Their opening game of the season against [[Sisaket F.C.|Sisaket]], was awarded 2\u20130 to Sisaket after an original 1\u20131 draw due to Siam Navy playing an ineligible player. To make things worse, the club knew the player in question couldn't play, but carried on hoping to get away with any sanctions \u2013 especially since the league is normally lax in the rules.\n\n===Queens Cup success===\n\nIn 2006 the club won the opening season [[Queen's Cup]] tournament. A tournament that is not mandatory but nonetheless a big part of the Thai football calendar at the time. They defeated [[Krung Thai Bank F.C.|Krung Thai Bank]] in the final after getting past [[Bangkok Bank F.C.|Bangkok Bank]] at the semi-final stage.\n\n===Yo-yo club===\n\nThe club has somewhat become known as a yo-yo club in the Thai football scene, being relegated and promoted from/to the top flight on four occasions. Although on each occasion they were promoted they weren't as champions.\n\n==Honours==\n* '''[[Thai Division 1 League]]:'''\n::Runner-up: 2006\n* '''[[Queen's Cup]]:'''\n::Winner: 2006\n* '''[[Thai League Cup]]:'''\n::Winner: 1990\n* '''Khor Royal Cup ({{lang-th|\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e04.}}):'''\n::Winner: 1989\n* '''Ngor Royal Cup ({{lang-th|\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e07.}}):'''\n::Winner: 1974\n\n==Stadium and locations by season records==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They play in the [[Thai League 2]]. The club has previously played under the names of Royal Thai Navy FC, Rajnavi FC and Rajnavy Rayong FC.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was formed on 10 January 1956 as the '''Royal Thai Navy Football Club''' and currently plays under the name of '''Navy Football Club''', locally known as Rajnavy. The club has also played under the names of Rajnavi and Rajnavy Rayong, Rayong being the town they played in and the main base of the Navy in general.\n\nSince the inception of the Thai League in 1996 the club played under the name of the Royal Thai Navy up until 2009, when all teams in Thailand had to become public limited companies. With this, many teams changed names and formed closer links with the communities they were based in. In this case the Navy became known as Rajnavy Rayong. Rajnavy being the local Thai name for the Navy. In 2011, and with a dispute as to the ownership of the club, the club moved from their Rayong home and into the Chonburi province where they ground share with [[Pattaya United F.C.|Pattaya United]] \u2013 another club playing outside of their original home town \u2013 albeit against league rules, where two sides in the PLT cannot ground share.\n\n===Ownership dispute===\n\nIn 2009, when Thai football was becoming increasingly popular with all professional football teams told to properly register and become a company limited, the situation was almost to the point where anyone could register this football club for an ownership. At this point, Rayong Thai Premier took the ownership and renamed the club to Rajnavy Rayong. However, two seasons after that, the [[Royal Thai Navy]] decided to bring the team back under control and renamed it to Siam Navy. Thereafter, the football club moved from [[Rayong Province|Rayong]] to [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]], [[Chonburi Province|Chonburi]].\n\n===Turmoil===\n\nAt the start of the 2011 league campaign, with the Navy in a bit of turmoil after the dispute of the owner of the club, they proceeded to get it wrong on the field as well. Their opening game of the season against [[Sisaket F.C.|Sisaket]], was awarded 2\u20130 to Sisaket after an original 1\u20131 draw due to Siam Navy playing an ineligible player. To make things worse, the club knew the player in question couldn't play, but carried on hoping to get away with any sanctions \u2013 especially since the league is normally lax in the rules.\n\n===Queens Cup success===\n\nIn 2006 the club won the opening season [[Queen's Cup]] tournament. A tournament that is not mandatory but nonetheless a big part of the Thai football calendar at the time. They defeated [[Krung Thai Bank F.C.|Krung Thai Bank]] in the final after getting past [[Bangkok Bank F.C.|Bangkok Bank]] at the semi-final stage.\n\n===Yo-yo club===\n\nThe club has somewhat become known as a yo-yo club in the Thai football scene, being relegated and promoted from/to the top flight on four occasions.

Only months separated this release from their debut [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Austere (EP)|Austere]]''. The album is greatly influenced by the music of [[At the Drive-In]], with whom most of Sparta's members originally played before their split in 2001.\n\nThe vocals and track naming in particular reflect At the Drive-In's ''[[Relationship of Command]]'', the last album made by the group. This is in contrast to the music of [[The Mars Volta]], formed by two other members of ATDI (Omar and Cedric), which departs entirely from the [[post-hardcore]] genre.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 69/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/wiretap-scars/sparta|title=Reviews for Wiretap Scars by Sparta|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r599697|pure_url=yes}}|title=Wiretap Scars - Sparta|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Drowned in Sound]]\n| rev2Score = 9/10<ref name=\"DinS\">{{cite magazine|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3027/reviews/4564-|title=Album Review: Sparta - Wiretap Scars|last=Frankowski|first=Andy|magazine=[[Drowned in Sound]]|date=August 10, 2002|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev3Score = 7.2/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7404-wiretap-scars/|title=Sparta: Wiretap Scars|last=Carr|first=Eric|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=August 22, 2002|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev4 = Punknews.org\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Punknews\">{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/1183/sparta-wiretap-scars|title=Sparta - Wiretap Scars|author=Daren|website=Punknews.org|date=August 27, 2002|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev5Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sparta/albums/album/134563/review/5943568/wiretap_scars|title=Sparta: Wiretap Scars|last=Appleford|first=Steve|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|date=August 26, 2002|accessdate=October 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602103107/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sparta/albums/album/134563/review/5943568/wiretap_scars|archivedate=June 2, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy }}</ref>\n| rev6 = [[Sputnikmusic]]\n| rev6Score = 4.0/5.0<ref name=\"Sputnik\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/2645/Sparta-Wiretap-Scars/|title=Sparta - Wiretap Scars|author=Damrod|website=[[Sputnikmusic]]|date=June 30, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n''Wiretap Scars'' garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s.

They have the same talent they had before but it\u2019s the way they deliver it that will have eyes being opened and ears to the ground.\"<ref name=\"DinS\"/> Jason Jackowiak of Splendid commented about the record, \"With ''Wiretap Scars'', Sparta have not only made great strides in the progression of their art form; they've also acknowledged the artists who inspired them. That said, the question remains: will Sparta gain recognition on the basis of their own merits, or are they forever to be judged against the accomplishments of their previous employers?

But from the time that it began to be used as an instrument of punishment, a transverse piece of wood was commonly added: not, however, always even then. For it would seem that there were more kinds of death than one by the cross; this being sometimes accomplished by transfixing the criminal with a pole, which was run through his back and spine, and came out at his mouth (adactum per medium hominem, qui per os emergat, stipitem)\".<ref>{{cite book|page=376\u2013377|title=The Imperial Bible-Dictionary |volume=I |year=1874|author= P.

In his ''[[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium]]'' Seneca mentions the ''adactum per medium hominem qui per os emergat stipitem'' (the stake which they drive straight through a man until it protrudes from his throat);<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/adluciliumepistu01seneuoft#page/86/mode/2up Seneca, ''Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium'' 14,5]</ref> and in his ''[[De Consolatione ad Marciam]]'' he says that ''alii per obscena stipitem egerunt'' (some force a stick upward through his groin).<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia#XX.
