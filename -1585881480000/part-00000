The [[High, middle and low justice|court]] rights were originally held by the [[Counts of Toggenburg]] through their servants, the Heitnau family.  These rights transferred in 1258 to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] [[Commandry (feudalism)|Commandry]] of Tobel.  These rights gradually expanded until 1500, by which time they had complete [[Manorialism|Manor]] and court rights.  The only exceptions was a house that had been granted freedom from local lords in 1547.  The ownership of this house changed often in the following centuries.

Within two years, the family moved to [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]], and Pet\u0151fi always viewed the city as his true home. His father tried to give his son the best possible education and sent him to a [[lyceum]], but when S\u00e1ndor was 15, the family went through a financially difficult period, due to the [[Danube flood]]s of 1838 and the bankruptcy of a relative. S\u00e1ndor had to leave the [[lyceum]] which he was attending in [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Selmecb\u00e1nya]] (today ''Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica'' in Slovakia). He held small jobs in various theatres in [[Pest (city)|Pest]], worked as a teacher in [[Ostffyasszonyfa]], and spent some months as a soldier in [[Sopron]].\n\nAfter a restless period of travelling, Pet\u0151fi attended college at [[P\u00e1pa]], where he met [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. A year later in 1842, his poem \"''A boroz\u00f3''\" (The Wine Drinker) was first published in the literary magazine ''[[Athenaeum (Hungarian journal)|Athenaeum]]'' under the name ''S\u00e1ndor Petrovics''. On 3 November the same year, he published the poem under the surname \"Pet\u0151fi\" for the first time.\n\nPet\u0151fi was more interested in the theatre. In 1842 he joined a travelling theatre, but had to leave it to earn money. He wrote for a newspaper, but could not make enough money. Malnourished and sick, he went to [[Debrecen]], where his friends helped him get back on his feet.\n\nIn 1844 he walked from Debrecen to [[Pest (Hungary)|Pest]] to find a publisher for his poems and he succeeded. His poems were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses.\n\nAmong his longer works is the epic \"''[[J\u00e1nos Vit\u00e9z]]''\" (John the Valiant; 1845). The poem is a fairy-tale notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its clever wordplay. It has gained immense popularity in [[Hungary]],<ref group=\"note\">It has several musical and film adaptations and is today considered a classic of [[Hungarian literature]].</ref> however, Pet\u0151fi felt influenced by his editor, Imre Vahot, to continue writing folklore-style poems, while he wanted to use his Western-oriented education and write about growing revolutionary passions. (The government's censorship would have made such works difficult to publish.)\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Szendrey julia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|J\u00falia Szendrey, Pet\u0151fi's wife]]\nIn 1846, he met {{ill|J\u00falia Szendrey|hu|Szendrey J\u00falia}} in [[Transylvania]].

He and J\u00falia moved to Pest, where he joined a group of like-minded students and intellectuals who regularly met at {{ill|Caf\u00e9 Pilvax|hu|Pilvax}}.

He was co-author and author, respectively, of the two most important written documents: the ''[[12 Pont]]'' (12 Points, demands to the Habsburg Governor-General) and the ''\"[[Nemzeti Dal]]\"'', his revolutionary poem.\n\nWhen the news of the revolution in [[Vienna]] reached them on the 15th, Pet\u0151fi and his friends decided to change the date of the \"National Assembly\" (a rally where a petition to the Hungarian noblemen's assembly would be approved by the people), from 19 March to the 15th. On the morning of the 15th, Pet\u0151fi and the revolutionaries began to march around the city of Pest, reading his poem and the \"12 Points\" to the growing crowd, which attracted thousands. Visiting printers, they declared an end to censorship and printed the poem and \"12 Points\".\n\nCrowds forced the mayor to sign the \"12 Points\" and later held a mass demonstration in front of the newly built [[Hungarian National Museum|National Museum]], then crossed to [[Buda]] on the other bank of the Danube. When the crowd rallied in front of the Imperial governing council, the representatives of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] felt they had to sign the \"12 Points\". As one of the points was freedom for political prisoners, the crowd moved to greet the newly freed revolutionary poet [[Mih\u00e1ly T\u00e1ncsics]].\n\nPet\u0151fi's popularity waned as the memory of the glorious day faded, and the revolution went the way of high politics: to the leadership of the nobles. Those in the noblemen's Assembly in [[Bratislava#Names|Pozsony]], (today ''Bratislava'') had been pushing for slower reforms at the same time, which they delivered to the Emperor on the 13th, but events had overtaken them briefly. Pet\u0151fi disagreed with the Assembly, and criticised their view of the goals and methods of the Revolution. (His colleague T\u00e1ncsics was imprisoned again by the new government.) In the general election, Pet\u0151fi ran in his native area, but did not win a seat. At this time, he wrote his most serious poem, ''Az Apostol'' (The Apostle). It was an [[Epic poetry|epic]] about a fictional revolutionary who, after much suffering, attempts, but fails, to assassinate a fictitious king.\n\nPet\u0151fi joined the Hungarian Revolutionary Army and fought under the Polish [[Classical Liberalism|Liberal]] General [[J\u00f3zef Bem]], in the ''Transylvanian army''. The army was initially successful against Habsburg troops, but after Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] intervened to support the Habsburgs, they were defeated. Pet\u0151fi was last seen alive in the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]] on 31 July 1849.\n\n==Death==\nPet\u0151fi is believed to have been [[killed in action]] during the battle of Segesv\u00e1r by the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. A Russian military doctor recorded an account of Pet\u0151fi's death in his diary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} As his body was never officially found, rumours of Pet\u0151fi's survival persisted. In his autobiographical [[roman a clef]] ''Political Fashions'' (''Politikai divatok'', 1862), [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]] imagined his late friend's \"resurrection\". In the novel Pet\u0151fi (the character named Pusztafi) returns ten years later as a shabby, ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' figure who has lost his faith in everything, including poetry.\n\nAlthough for many years his death at Segesv\u00e1r had been assumed, in the late 1980s Soviet investigators found archives that revealed that after the battle about 1,800 Hungarian prisoners of war were marched to [[Siberia]].

Retrieved 17 October 2011.</ref> In 1990, an expedition was organised to [[Barguzin (rural locality)|Barguzin]], [[Buryatia]], Siberia, where [[archaeologists]] claimed to have unearthed Pet\u0151fi's skeleton.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Makkai|title=In Quest of the 'Miracle Stag'|page=298|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1996|isbn=0-9642094-0-3}}</ref> Furthermore, in Hungary they have a saying after him: \"Elt\u0171nt, mint Pet\u0151fi a k\u00f6dben\" (Disappeared, like Pet\u0151fi in the fog).\n\n== Poetry ==\nPet\u0151fi started his career as a poet with \"popular situation songs\", a genre to which his first published poem, ''A boroz\u00f3'' (\"The Wine Drinker\", 1842), belongs. It is the song of a drinker praising the healing power of wine to drive away all troubles. This kind of pseudo-folk song was not unusual in Hungarian poetry of the 1840s, but Pet\u0151fi soon developed an original and fresh voice which made him stand out. He wrote many folk song-like poems on the subjects of wine, love, [[Romanticism|romantic]] robbers etc. Many of these early poems have become classics, for example the love poem ''A vir\u00e1gnak megtiltani nem lehet'' (\"You Cannot Forbid the Flower\", 1843), or ''Befordultam a konyh\u00e1ra'' (\"I Turned into the Kitchen\", 1843) which uses the ancient metaphor of love and fire in a playful and somewhat provocative way.\n\nThe influence of folk poetry and 19th-century populism is very significant in Pet\u0151fi's work, but other influences are also present: Pet\u0151fi drew on sources such as [[topoi]] of contemporary [[almanac]]-poetry in an inventive way, and was familiar with the works of major literary figures of his day, including [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger]] and [[Heinrich Heine]].\n\nPet\u0151fi's early poetry was often interpreted as some kind of role-playing, due to the broad range of situations and voices he created and used. Recent interpretations however call attention to the fact that in some sense all lyrical poetry can be understood as role-playing, which makes the category of \"role-poems\" (coined especially for Pet\u0151fi) superfluous. While using a variety of voices, Pet\u0151fi created a well-formed [[persona]] for himself: a jaunty, stubborn loner who loves wine, hates all kinds of limits and boundaries and is passionate in all he feels. In poems such as ''J\u00f6vend\u00f6l\u00e9s'' (\"Prophecy\", 1843) he imagines himself as someone who will die young after doing great things. This motif recurs in the revolutionary poetry of his later years.\n\nThe influence of contemporary almanac-poetry can be best seen in the poem cycle ''Cipruslombok Etelke s\u00edrj\u00e1ra'' (\"Branches of Cypress for Etelke's Tomb\", 1845). These sentimental poems, which are about death, grief, love, memory and loneliness were written after a love interest of Pet\u0151fi's, Etelke Csap\u00f3, died.\n\nIn the years 1844\u201345 Pet\u0151fi's poetry became more and more subtle and mature. New subjects appeared, such as landscape. His most influential landscape poem is ''Az Alf\u00f6ld'' (\"The Plains\"), in which he says that his homeland, the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plains]] are more beautiful and much dearer than the [[Carpathian mountains]]; it was to become the foundation of a long-lived fashion: that of the plains as the typical Hungarian landscape.\n\nPet\u0151fi's poetic skills solidified and broadened. He became a master of using different kinds of voices, for example his poem ''A r\u00e9gi, j\u00f3 Gvad\u00e1nyi'' (\"The Good Old Gvad\u00e1nyi\") imitates the style of {{ill|J\u00f3zsef Gvad\u00e1nyi|hu|Gvad\u00e1nyi J\u00f3zsef}}, a Hungarian poet who lived at the end of the 18th century.\n\nPet\u0151fi maintained a lifelong friendship with [[J\u00e1nos Arany]], another significant poet of the time. Arany was the godfather of Pet\u0151fi's son {{ill|Zolt\u00e1n Pet\u0151fi|hu|Pet\u0151fi Zolt\u00e1n|lt=Zolt\u00e1n}}.\n\n== Honours and memorials ==\n[[File:Petofi Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pet\u0151fi statue in Budapest]]\nAfter the Revolution was crushed, Pet\u0151fi's writing became immensely popular, while his rebelliousness served as a role model ever since for Hungarian revolutionaries and would-be revolutionaries of every political colour.\n\nHungarian composer and contemporary [[Franz Liszt]] composed the piano piece ''[[Dem Andenken Pet\u0151fis]]'' (''In Pet\u0151fi's Memory'') in his honour. Liszt has also set several of Pet\u0151fi's poems to music.\n\nIn 1911, a statue of S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi was erected in Pressburg (Pozsony, present-day [[Bratislava]]), on the Main Square. In 1918, after the army of the newly independent First Czechoslovak Republic occupied the city, the statue was dynamited.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Mad\u00e1ch-Posonium Kft| url = http://www.hhrf.org/szabadujsag/2004/23/petofi.htm| title = A v\u00e1ndorl\u00f3 Pet\u0151fi| date = n.d.| access-date = 20 July 2008| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050124123130/http://www.hhrf.org/szabadujsag/2004/23/petofi.htm| archive-date = 24 January 2005| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Ferenc Keszeli, \"Pozsony...

Within two years, the family moved to [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]], and Pet\u0151fi always viewed the city as his true home. His father tried to give his son the best possible education and sent him to a [[lyceum]], but when S\u00e1ndor was 15, the family went through a financially difficult period, due to the [[Danube flood]]s of 1838 and the bankruptcy of a relative. S\u00e1ndor had to leave the [[lyceum]] which he was attending in [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Selmecb\u00e1nya]] (today ''Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica'' in Slovakia). He held small jobs in various theatres in [[Pest (city)|Pest]], worked as a teacher in [[Ostffyasszonyfa]], and spent some months as a soldier in [[Sopron]].\n\nAfter a restless period of travelling, Pet\u0151fi attended college at [[P\u00e1pa]], where he met [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. A year later in 1842, his poem \"''A boroz\u00f3''\" (The Wine Drinker) was first published in the literary magazine ''[[Athenaeum (Hungarian journal)|Athenaeum]]'' under the name ''S\u00e1ndor Petrovics''. On 3 November the same year, he published the poem under the surname \"Pet\u0151fi\" for the first time.\n\nPet\u0151fi was more interested in the theatre. In 1842 he joined a travelling theatre, but had to leave it to earn money. He wrote for a newspaper, but could not make enough money. Malnourished and sick, he went to [[Debrecen]], where his friends helped him get back on his feet.\n\nIn 1844 he walked from Debrecen to [[Pest (Hungary)|Pest]] to find a publisher for his poems and he succeeded. His poems were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses.\n\nAmong his longer works is the epic \"''[[J\u00e1nos Vit\u00e9z]]''\" (John the Valiant; 1845). The poem is a fairy-tale notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its clever wordplay. It has gained immense popularity in [[Hungary]],<ref group=\"note\">It has several musical and film adaptations and is today considered a classic of [[Hungarian literature]].</ref> however, Pet\u0151fi felt influenced by his editor, Imre Vahot, to continue writing folklore-style poems, while he wanted to use his Western-oriented education and write about growing revolutionary passions. (The government's censorship would have made such works difficult to publish.)\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Szendrey julia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|J\u00falia Szendrey, Pet\u0151fi's wife]]\nIn 1846, he met {{ill|J\u00falia Szendrey|hu|Szendrey J\u00falia}} in [[Transylvania]].

They worked on promoting Hungarian as the language of literature and theatre, formerly based on German.<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/02000/02065/html/1kotet/24.html A PESTI MAGYAR SZ\u00cdNH\u00c1Z \u00c9P\u00cdT\u00c9SE \u00c9S MEGSZERVEZ\u00c9SE] Gy\u00f6rgy Sz\u00e9kely \u2013 Ferenc Ker\u00e9nyi (eds.): MAGYAR SZ\u00cdNH\u00c1ZT\u00d6RT\u00c9NET 1790\u20131873.

He was co-author and author, respectively, of the two most important written documents: the ''[[12 Pont]]'' (12 Points, demands to the Habsburg Governor-General) and the ''\"[[Nemzeti Dal]]\"'', his revolutionary poem.\n\nWhen the news of the revolution in [[Vienna]] reached them on the 15th, Pet\u0151fi and his friends decided to change the date of the \"National Assembly\" (a rally where a petition to the Hungarian noblemen's assembly would be approved by the people), from 19 March to the 15th. On the morning of the 15th, Pet\u0151fi and the revolutionaries began to march around the city of Pest, reading his poem and the \"12 Points\" to the growing crowd, which attracted thousands. Visiting printers, they declared an end to censorship and printed the poem and \"12 Points\".\n\nCrowds forced the mayor to sign the \"12 Points\" and later held a mass demonstration in front of the newly built [[Hungarian National Museum|National Museum]], then crossed to [[Buda]] on the other bank of the Danube. When the crowd rallied in front of the Imperial governing council, the representatives of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] felt they had to sign the \"12 Points\". As one of the points was freedom for political prisoners, the crowd moved to greet the newly freed revolutionary poet [[Mih\u00e1ly T\u00e1ncsics]].\n\nPet\u0151fi's popularity waned as the memory of the glorious day faded, and the revolution went the way of high politics: to the leadership of the nobles. Those in the noblemen's Assembly in [[Bratislava#Names|Pozsony]], (today ''Bratislava'') had been pushing for slower reforms at the same time, which they delivered to the Emperor on the 13th, but events had overtaken them briefly. Pet\u0151fi disagreed with the Assembly, and criticised their view of the goals and methods of the Revolution. (His colleague T\u00e1ncsics was imprisoned again by the new government.) In the general election, Pet\u0151fi ran in his native area, but did not win a seat. At this time, he wrote his most serious poem, ''Az Apostol'' (The Apostle). It was an [[Epic poetry|epic]] about a fictional revolutionary who, after much suffering, attempts, but fails, to assassinate a fictitious king.\n\nPet\u0151fi joined the Hungarian Revolutionary Army and fought under the Polish [[Classical Liberalism|Liberal]] General [[J\u00f3zef Bem]], in the ''Transylvanian army''. The army was initially successful against Habsburg troops, but after Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] intervened to support the Habsburgs, they were defeated. Pet\u0151fi was last seen alive in the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]] on 31 July 1849.\n\n==Death==\nPet\u0151fi is believed to have been [[killed in action]] during the battle of Segesv\u00e1r by the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. A Russian military doctor recorded an account of Pet\u0151fi's death in his diary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} As his body was never officially found, rumours of Pet\u0151fi's survival persisted. In his autobiographical [[roman a clef]] ''Political Fashions'' (''Politikai divatok'', 1862), [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]] imagined his late friend's \"resurrection\". In the novel Pet\u0151fi (the character named Pusztafi) returns ten years later as a shabby, ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' figure who has lost his faith in everything, including poetry.\n\nAlthough for many years his death at Segesv\u00e1r had been assumed, in the late 1980s Soviet investigators found archives that revealed that after the battle about 1,800 Hungarian prisoners of war were marched to [[Siberia]]. Alternative theories suggest that he was one of them and died of tuberculosis in 1856.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454072/Sandor-Petofi Sandor Petofi (Hungarian poet) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia].

Retrieved 17 October 2011.</ref> In 1990, an expedition was organised to [[Barguzin (rural locality)|Barguzin]], [[Buryatia]], Siberia, where [[archaeologists]] claimed to have unearthed Pet\u0151fi's skeleton.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Makkai|title=In Quest of the 'Miracle Stag'|page=298|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1996|isbn=0-9642094-0-3}}</ref> Furthermore, in Hungary they have a saying after him: \"Elt\u0171nt, mint Pet\u0151fi a k\u00f6dben\" (Disappeared, like Pet\u0151fi in the fog).\n\n== Poetry ==\nPet\u0151fi started his career as a poet with \"popular situation songs\", a genre to which his first published poem, ''A boroz\u00f3'' (\"The Wine Drinker\", 1842), belongs. It is the song of a drinker praising the healing power of wine to drive away all troubles. This kind of pseudo-folk song was not unusual in Hungarian poetry of the 1840s, but Pet\u0151fi soon developed an original and fresh voice which made him stand out. He wrote many folk song-like poems on the subjects of wine, love, [[Romanticism|romantic]] robbers etc. Many of these early poems have become classics, for example the love poem ''A vir\u00e1gnak megtiltani nem lehet'' (\"You Cannot Forbid the Flower\", 1843), or ''Befordultam a konyh\u00e1ra'' (\"I Turned into the Kitchen\", 1843) which uses the ancient metaphor of love and fire in a playful and somewhat provocative way.\n\nThe influence of folk poetry and 19th-century populism is very significant in Pet\u0151fi's work, but other influences are also present: Pet\u0151fi drew on sources such as [[topoi]] of contemporary [[almanac]]-poetry in an inventive way, and was familiar with the works of major literary figures of his day, including [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger]] and [[Heinrich Heine]].\n\nPet\u0151fi's early poetry was often interpreted as some kind of role-playing, due to the broad range of situations and voices he created and used. Recent interpretations however call attention to the fact that in some sense all lyrical poetry can be understood as role-playing, which makes the category of \"role-poems\" (coined especially for Pet\u0151fi) superfluous. While using a variety of voices, Pet\u0151fi created a well-formed [[persona]] for himself: a jaunty, stubborn loner who loves wine, hates all kinds of limits and boundaries and is passionate in all he feels. In poems such as ''J\u00f6vend\u00f6l\u00e9s'' (\"Prophecy\", 1843) he imagines himself as someone who will die young after doing great things. This motif recurs in the revolutionary poetry of his later years.\n\nThe influence of contemporary almanac-poetry can be best seen in the poem cycle ''Cipruslombok Etelke s\u00edrj\u00e1ra'' (\"Branches of Cypress for Etelke's Tomb\", 1845). These sentimental poems, which are about death, grief, love, memory and loneliness were written after a love interest of Pet\u0151fi's, Etelke Csap\u00f3, died.\n\nIn the years 1844\u201345 Pet\u0151fi's poetry became more and more subtle and mature. New subjects appeared, such as landscape. His most influential landscape poem is ''Az Alf\u00f6ld'' (\"The Plains\"), in which he says that his homeland, the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plains]] are more beautiful and much dearer than the [[Carpathian mountains]]; it was to become the foundation of a long-lived fashion: that of the plains as the typical Hungarian landscape.\n\nPet\u0151fi's poetic skills solidified and broadened. He became a master of using different kinds of voices, for example his poem ''A r\u00e9gi, j\u00f3 Gvad\u00e1nyi'' (\"The Good Old Gvad\u00e1nyi\") imitates the style of {{ill|J\u00f3zsef Gvad\u00e1nyi|hu|Gvad\u00e1nyi J\u00f3zsef}}, a Hungarian poet who lived at the end of the 18th century.\n\nPet\u0151fi maintained a lifelong friendship with [[J\u00e1nos Arany]], another significant poet of the time. Arany was the godfather of Pet\u0151fi's son {{ill|Zolt\u00e1n Pet\u0151fi|hu|Pet\u0151fi Zolt\u00e1n|lt=Zolt\u00e1n}}.\n\n== Honours and memorials ==\n[[File:Petofi Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pet\u0151fi statue in Budapest]]\nAfter the Revolution was crushed, Pet\u0151fi's writing became immensely popular, while his rebelliousness served as a role model ever since for Hungarian revolutionaries and would-be revolutionaries of every political colour.\n\nHungarian composer and contemporary [[Franz Liszt]] composed the piano piece ''[[Dem Andenken Pet\u0151fis]]'' (''In Pet\u0151fi's Memory'') in his honour. Liszt has also set several of Pet\u0151fi's poems to music.\n\nIn 1911, a statue of S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi was erected in Pressburg (Pozsony, present-day [[Bratislava]]), on the Main Square. In 1918, after the army of the newly independent First Czechoslovak Republic occupied the city, the statue was dynamited.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Mad\u00e1ch-Posonium Kft| url = http://www.hhrf.org/szabadujsag/2004/23/petofi.htm| title = A v\u00e1ndorl\u00f3 Pet\u0151fi| date = n.d.| access-date = 20 July 2008| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050124123130/http://www.hhrf.org/szabadujsag/2004/23/petofi.htm| archive-date = 24 January 2005| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Ferenc Keszeli, \"Pozsony...

His progression in the 1980s is known as the \"lep\u00e9nisation of spirits\" due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the \"Devil of the Republic\" among his opponents or as the \"last samurai in politics\" among his supporters.\n\nHis longevity in politics and his five attempts to become [[President of France]] have made him a major figure in [[Politics in France|French political life]]. His progress to the second round in the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] left its mark on French public life and the \"21st of April\" is now a frequently used expression in France. A former [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), he served as the Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018. He was expelled from the party by his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015, after new controversial statements.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nJean Louis Marie Le Pen was the only son of Jean Le Pen (1901-1942).

He also served as Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018.\n\nHe graduated from [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]] in 1949. After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]].\n\nLe Pen focuses on issues related to [[immigration to France]], the [[European Union]], [[Traditional values|traditional culture and values]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] and [[Economy of France|France's high rate of unemployment]]. His progression in the 1980s is known as the \"lep\u00e9nisation of spirits\" due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the \"Devil of the Republic\" among his opponents or as the \"last samurai in politics\" among his supporters.\n\nHis longevity in politics and his five attempts to become [[President of France]] have made him a major figure in [[Politics in France|French political life]]. His progress to the second round in the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] left its mark on French public life and the \"21st of April\" is now a frequently used expression in France. A former [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), he served as the Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018. He was expelled from the party by his daughter [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015, after new controversial statements.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nJean Louis Marie Le Pen was the only son of Jean Le Pen (1901-1942).
