[[Thomas J. Watson|Thomas J. Watson Sr.]], IBM\u2019s head, asked two of his top inventors, [[Clair D. Lake]] and [[J.

[[Thomas Watson Jr.|Tom Watson Jr.'s]] decision to sign this decree, where IBM saw the punched card provisions as the most significant point, completed the transfer of power to him from [[Thomas J. Watson|Thomas Watson, Sr]].<ref name=\"Belden\"/>\n\nThe [[UNITYPER]] introduced magnetic tape for data entry in the 1950s. During the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for [[computer storage|data storage]] by [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], as better, more capable computers became available. [[Mohawk Data Sciences]] introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful. Punched cards were still commonly used for entering both data and computer programs <!-- \"programming\" is the act, \"program\" is the physical object punched in the cards--> until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost [[disk drive|magnetic disk storage]], and affordable [[computer terminal|interactive terminals]] on less expensive [[minicomputer]]s made punched cards obsolete for these roles as well.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Aspray |editor-first = W. | title = Computing before Computers |publisher = [[Iowa State University Press]] | year = 1990  | isbn =  978-0-8138-0047-9| page = 151 }}</ref> However, their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats. The terminals that replaced the punched cards, the [[IBM 3270]] for example, displayed 80 [[Characters per line|columns of text]] in [[text mode]], for compatibility with existing software. Some programs still operate on the convention of 80 text columns, although fewer and fewer do as newer systems employ [[graphical user interface]]s with variable-width type fonts.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Punched card program deck.agr.jpg|thumb|A deck of punched cards comprising a computer program]]\nThe terms ''punched card'', ''punch card'', and ''punchcard'' were all commonly used, as were ''IBM card'' and ''Hollerith card'' (after [[Herman Hollerith]]).<ref>Steven Pinker, in ''The Stuff of Thought'', Viking, 2007, p.362, notes the loss of ''-ed'' in pronunciation ''as it did in ice cream, mincemeat, and box set, formerly iced cream, minced meat, and boxed set.''</ref> IBM used \"IBM card\" or, later, \"punched card\" at first mention in its documentation and thereafter simply \"card\" or \"cards\".<ref>\"An important function in IBM Accounting is the automatic preparation of IBM cards.\" IBM 519 Principles of Operation, Form 22-3292-5, 1946</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=IBM|quote=The IBM 1402 Card Read-Punch provides the system with simultaneous punched-card input and output.

These patents described both [[paper tape]] and rectangular cards as possible recording media. The card shown in {{US patent|src=uspto|395781}} of January 8 was printed with a template and had hole positions arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a [[railroad conductor]]'s [[ticket punch]], with the center reserved for written descriptions. Hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger:\n\n: \"I was traveling in the West and I had a ticket with what I think was called a punch photograph...the conductor...punched out a description of the individual, as light hair, dark eyes, large nose, etc. So you see, I only made a punch photograph of each person.\"<ref>(Austrian 1982, p.15)</ref>\n\nWhen use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone Hollerith developed the [[pantograph]] \"keyboard punch\". It featured an enlarged diagram of the card, indicating the positions of the holes to be punched. A printed reading board could be placed under a card that was to be read manually.<ref>(Truesdell 1965, p.43)</ref>\n\nHollerith envisioned a number of card sizes. In an article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating the 1890 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census]], Hollerith suggested a card 3&nbsp;inches by 5\u00bd inches of [[Manila paper|Manila stock]] \"would be sufficient to answer all ordinary purposes.\"<ref name=minesquarterly>{{cite journal |last=Hollerith|first=Herman|editor-last=da Cruz|editor-first=Frank|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/hh/index.html#%5B-245-%5D |title=An Electric Tabulating System |journal=The Quarterly |publisher=Columbia University School of Mines |volume=10 |issue=16 |date=April 1889 |page=245}}</ref>  The cards used in the 1890 census had round holes, 12 rows and 24 columns.

His tabulating machine had up to 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count up to 9,999.  During a given tabulating run counters were assigned specific holes or, using [[relay logic]], combination of holes.<ref name=minesquarterly/>\n\nLater designs led to a card with ten rows, each row assigned a digit value, 0 through 9, and 45 columns.<ref name = \"Bashe\">{{cite book |last=Bashe |first=Charles J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Lyle R. |last3=Palmer |first3=John H. |last4=Pugh |first4=Emerson W. |title=IBM's Early Computers |publisher=[[The MIT Press]] |year=1986 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=[https://archive.org/details/ibmsearlycompute00bash/page/5 5] |isbn=978-0-262-02225-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/ibmsearlycompute00bash/page/5 }} Also see  pages 5-14 for additional information on punched cards.</ref>  \nThis card provided for fields to record multi-digit numbers that tabulators could sum, instead of their simply counting cards.

[[Thomas J. Watson|Thomas J. Watson Sr.]], IBM\u2019s head, asked two of his top inventors, [[Clair D. Lake]] and [[J.

Lake suggested rectangular holes, which could be spaced more tightly, allowing 80 columns per punched card, thereby nearly doubling the capacity of the older format.<ref>[http://ibm-1401.info/Patent1772492.pdf U.S. Patent 1,772,492, Record Sheet for Tabulating Machines], C.

These cards have tiny (1&nbsp;mm), circular holes, smaller than those in [[paper tape]]. Data is stored in 6-bit [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]], with three rows of 32 characters each, or 8-bit [[EBCDIC]]. In this format, each column of the top tiers are combined with two punch rows from the bottom tier to form an 8-bit byte, and the middle tier is combined with two more punch rows, so that each card contains 64 bytes of 8-bit-per-byte binary coded data.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Winter\n  | first = Dik T\n  | title = 96-column Punched Card Code\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415041458/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/96col.html\n  | archivedate = April 15, 2007\n  | url = http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/96col.html#start\n  | accessdate = November 6, 2012\n  }}</ref>\n\n===Powers/Remington Rand/UNIVAC 90-column punched card format===\n[[File:RemingtonRandCard.agr.jpg|thumb|left|A blank [[Remington Rand]] [[UNIVAC]] format card.

The exact location of the landfall has long been disputed, with different communities vying for the honor.

Since the discovery of the \"John Day letter\" in the 1950s, it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island.

Cabot's royal patent, issued by the Crown in 1496, stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from Bristol, so his primary financial supporters were probably based in that city.

Ruddock also suggested that Carbonariis accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition. She further suggested that the friar, on good terms with the King, introduced the explorer to [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]].

The exact location of the landfall has long been disputed, with different communities vying for the honor.

Since the discovery of the \"John Day letter\" in the 1950s, it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island. This is because Day's letter implies that the coastline explored in 1497 lay between the latitudes of Bordeaux, France and Dursey Head in southern Ireland. The initial landfall seems to have taken place close to the southern latitude, with the expedition returning home after reaching the northern one.<ref>Evan T. Jones and Margaret M.

In 2009, Jones confirmed that William Weston (who was not previously known to have been involved) led an expedition from Bristol [with royal support] to the \"[[Newfoundland|new found land]]\" in 1499 or 1500, making him the first Englishman to lead exploration of North America.

Condon and Jones also revealed that in 1500 the King rewarded Weston \u00a330 for 'his expenses about the finding of the new land'.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/>\n\nKing Henry VII continued to support exploration from Bristol. The king granted Hugh Eliot, Robert Thorne and his son a bounty of \u00a320 in January 1502 for purchasing the ''Gabriel'', a ship for an expedition voyage that summer. Later in 1502 or early 1503, he paid Eliot a reward of \u00a3100 for a voyage, or voyages, in \"2 ships to the Isle of new finding,\" as Newfoundland was called. This amount was larger than any previously accounted for in royal support of the explorations.<ref name=\"henry7\"/> Around this time the Bristol-based explorers established a formal company, backed by Letters Patent, called the Company Adventurers to the New Found Land.
