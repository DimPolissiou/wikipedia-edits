The scandal ultimately led to his resignation and prosecution.\n\nThe news of his age and certificate forgery first broke out on 16 February 1999 by an investigative news publication, [[TheNews magazine]]. Their investigation concluded that Buhari was born in 1970 and not 1963 as he claimed, and also that he did not graduate from the University of Toronto. The article published about the speaker dispelled that the speaker did not attended the university, not to talk of graduating. Section 65(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria disqualifies anyone below the age of 30 from running for membership of the House of Representatives.\n\nBuhari had also claimed that he completed his [[National Youth Service Corps|National Youth Service]] at Standard Construction in [[Kano]] which was also not true, as his name could not be found on any record in the list of those who completed the scheme. When Buhari was confronted with multiple allegations about his declaration and falsification, he promptly responded accusing the publications as an attack on him and proclaims his innocence and threatened to file a lawsuit against the publisher for libel.

While cleaning the floors, they stumbled across a Fleemco comic book. They mail-ordered a Fleemco phone (which allows them to replace any person or animal they desire) and in the process they got new parents: a female British secret agent named Agent K and a professional daredevil named Dick Daring. Whenever Todd and Riley want to replace someone undesirable, they call Conrad Fleem on the Fleemco phone via a large button. Fleemco immediately replaces the person with someone to the liking of Todd and Riley. The series follows their disordered misadventures as they use Fleemco to attempt to better their lives in nearly each problematic situation they encounter.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Replacements episodes}}\n{{:List of The Replacements episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{overly detailed|date=November 2017}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* Todd Bartholomew Daring (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) \u2013 Riley's younger brother. He is the lazy, trouble-making, and selfish one of the siblings. He and Riley are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. He usually uses the Fleemco phone to replace people for selfish purposes. He is best friends with Jacobo and Shelton. In an episode, it is revealed that Todd has a talent for singing. Riley, K, and Dick forced him to join the school choir, along with Shelton Klutzberry and the twins. Todd loves the Monkey Cop movie series as well as playing the Gamecone (parody of [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]) video game console. He hates school, learning, and reading which forces him to replace the librarian in another episode. His catchphrases include \"Don't judge me\" and \"Sweet.\" In \"Ratted Out\" for the first time, Todd sings the second verse to \"My Rat Buddy\" at the end of the episode. In season two, Todd still has feelings for Sierra after the one-time bond between the two after the parody of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanclub. In the episode ''Tasumi Unmasked'', Todd formed his own one-man band and battles against the mailman for his \"Game Cone 4\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Riley Eugene Daring (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Todd's older sister. She is the kinder, more caring and reliable sibling who enjoys school. She and Todd are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. She generally uses the Fleemco phone to replace mean or unfair adults, but sometimes she use it for her own selfish purpose. She is a girly girl and enjoys playing [[baseball]], playing the violin, horses, ponies, Hornet Hive Scouts, candy, and pretty much any form of sugar. At one point, she was part of the [[Journalism]] staff at school. She has a crush on Johnny Hitswell and they became a couple in season 2. But in \"Heartbreak in the City\", Johnny broke up with her because of her controlling demeanor. She claims she is over him, despite many people who claim otherwise.  She has an imaginary unicorn friend named Rainbow Jumper. She gets a B average in school. She prefers playing country fiddle/country rock on the violin. Riley is a fan of Susie May, Dustin Dreamlake, and J.J. Baker's. Riley can easily become jealous like when Todd made a fortune off of his \"Gum Art\" and she wasn't with her Unicorn \"Art\". Riley loves reading and the library. Riley had braces when she was younger. Riley also has a mission: Get Todd to do the right thing and be selfless. Sugar makes Riley hyper. In \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\" Riley tries one of her dream careers as a spy instead of a window washer that the Career Day test and the ex-guidance counselor Mr. Leslie told her to be, and almost blows up Antarctica when she stows away on K's mission to stop Dr. Scorpius, but in the end Riley saves the day even though K's mission is too dangerous. In \"She Works Hard For The Movie\" we learn that Riley has an Aunt Debbie and her middle name is Eugene. In \"Ratted out\", she started to sing the very first song of the whole series entitled \"My Rat Buddy\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Karen Mildred \"Agent K\" Daring (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) \u2013 Agent K resembles [[Emma Peel]]. She is the siblings' adoptive British mother and is a superspy. Agent K's height is 6'1 tall. From an outside view it may seem she doesn't care for her kids or husband, but in fact she loves them devotedly, even though she may express it through a recording or videotape. If something is done unfairly, she fixes it very quickly. She is seen to be a terrible cook. Her career as a spy has also made her highly suspicious of anything that is the least bit out-of-place, to the point of [[paranoia]]. In the episode Abra K Dabra!, it is revealed that she has stage fright and that her middle name is Mildred. She also has a habit for thinking all her chores are secret missions. She plays classical violin, which Riley hates and it puts Dick to sleep. K once took karate lessons from the evil Master Pho (Master Foe) to bust his secret evil bank-robbing karate gang. Even though she's just as logical as C.A.R. (albeit less sarcastic and violent), she seems to favor Dick over him. Even though both Dick and Agent K are the replacement adoptive parents, they still seem to be very much in love and care for Riley and Todd as their own children. Her mother is also a secret agent. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Richard Marion \"Dick\" Daring (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 He is the siblings' world-greatest daredevil adoptive father. He is a semi-former stunt artist, and is constantly working on new tricks. His appearance resembles that of [[Evel Knievel]]. He is also rather immature, and is seen having a teddy bear known as \"Evel Bearnievel\". He thinks that C.A.R. is his best friend, though C.A.R. doesn't see it that way. Dick bought Riley a mule named Prince Cinnamon Boots instead of a horse like she wanted. Like Todd, Dick isn't smart at all. In \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\" we learn that Dick is afraid of clowns and tries to force Todd to be a stunt man instead of a circus clown for his career. In \"She Works Hard For The Movie\" we learn that Dick was in a movie back in the 1970s. We also hear Dick sing his first true song; \"Space training Montage\" in \"Space family Daring\". It is also revealed in one episode that he is a better cook than K. His catchphrase is \"Look out below!\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* C.A.R.T.E.R. (voiced by [[David McCallum]]) \u2013 C.A.R.T.E.R. a.k.a. C.A.R. is the high-tech family car with a British accent. He can do just about anything, but is not always willing to do something for the family, especially not for Dick. He often calls Dick a twit, but is often indifferent to him. He does not wish to let Dick drive him, presumably under the assumption that Dick's daredevil habits would cause him to wreck C.A.R.T.E.R. He prefers to use a maneuver called \"The Oslo Option\" to scare Dick, which consists of C.A.R.T.E.R. pulling out a large spinning buzzsaw blade from his hood. The family usually refers to him as simply C.A.R. which is most likely a [[parody]] of K.I.T.T from ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. C.A.R also resembles the [[Mach Five]] from [[Speed Racer]]. In the episode ''Tasumi Unmasked'', C.A.R used to be a one-man band player back when he wanted to join other one-man band members, but was kicked out for not being perfect. They  destroyed his instruments. Also in this episode, he had a goatee, possibly real or not. The goatee was ripped by the other one-man band members. He is sarcastic, witty, and violent. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Conrad Fleem (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])  \u2013 Conrad is the mysterious owner of the Fleemco company. He processes Todd and Riley's requests whenever they call him. He has a very long mustache. In the show his face is never shown until the episode \"Irreplaceble\" where it is also revealed his mustache is red and not black. In a flashback of his it appears he was bullied during his childhood.

First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n\n===Major===\n* Tasumi (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 She is Riley's best friend, who is of [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent and has a crush on Jacobo and kissed him revealed in one episode. There is hint of Tasumi's crush on Jacobo in \"The Truth Hurts\" when she passes on a note in the classroom that asks Jacobo if she liked him and was crushed when he signed maybe. She wears a pink metal suit which resembles ''[[RoboCop]]''. But during season 2 she no longer wears her metal suit. She claims her family is part of a crime-fighting team. (parody of ''[[Power Rangers]]''/''[[Super Sentai]]''). She also has a list of people she hates. Riley is either on or off it. In the episode \"Best friends For-Never?\" it appears Riley first meets Tasumi in a broom closet when she was new at school and tried to get to homeroom but got lost. Tasumi was in the broom closet because she split her armor and was embarrassed, but Riley fixed it with the duct tape her dad made her carry. In the episode \"Tasumi Unmasked\", it is revealed that Tasumi is in fact a Japanese pop star. She moved to Pleasant Hills in order to escape the constant adoration of her fans and live a peaceful life, as Pleasant Hills was voted as the least culturally aware town in the world and she believed that nobody there would recognize her. However, in order to make sure that nobody recognized her, she wore a costume from a popular anime and used details from that anime in order to get a new history. That's the reason she always referred to things such as fighting giant monsters and so forth, but in reality, she never did anything of that sort. When her fans found out about this, she moved back to Japan for 2 weeks to record a new album until Riley replaced her band members with orangutans and she got kicked out by her new orangutan members because she has thumbs (even though orangutans do have thumbs). She came back to Pleasant Hills with Riley and no longer wears her metal suit, dumping it in the garbage.

He becomes very muscular and handsome when he takes his glasses off, but this is not to his advantage because he can't use contacts, and has to have heavy glasses (which causes him to appear weak and scrawny). He always seems to be where ever Todd and Riley are. He sometimes just wants to be part of a popular group. In one episode he is seen to have a giant pet tortoise. In another he and his entire family are stated to be [[Jews|Jew]][[Judaism|ish]].

She has her own posse (Jennifer and Claudia) and a huge, conceited ego. She is seen to have another side in which, she is infatuated with a ''[[Star Trek]]'' parody mentioned, which Todd also likes.

While cleaning the floors, they stumbled across a Fleemco comic book. They mail-ordered a Fleemco phone (which allows them to replace any person or animal they desire) and in the process they got new parents: a female British secret agent named Agent K and a professional daredevil named Dick Daring. Whenever Todd and Riley want to replace someone undesirable, they call Conrad Fleem on the Fleemco phone via a large button. Fleemco immediately replaces the person with someone to the liking of Todd and Riley. The series follows their disordered misadventures as they use Fleemco to attempt to better their lives in nearly each problematic situation they encounter.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Replacements episodes}}\n{{:List of The Replacements episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{overly detailed|date=November 2017}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* Todd Bartholomew Daring (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) \u2013 Riley's younger brother. He is the lazy, trouble-making, and selfish one of the siblings. He and Riley are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. He usually uses the Fleemco phone to replace people for selfish purposes. He is best friends with Jacobo and Shelton. In an episode, it is revealed that Todd has a talent for singing. Riley, K, and Dick forced him to join the school choir, along with Shelton Klutzberry and the twins. Todd loves the Monkey Cop movie series as well as playing the Gamecone (parody of [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]) video game console. He hates school, learning, and reading which forces him to replace the librarian in another episode. His catchphrases include \"Don't judge me\" and \"Sweet.\" In \"Ratted Out\" for the first time, Todd sings the second verse to \"My Rat Buddy\" at the end of the episode. In season two, Todd still has feelings for Sierra after the one-time bond between the two after the parody of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanclub. In the episode ''Tasumi Unmasked'', Todd formed his own one-man band and battles against the mailman for his \"Game Cone 4\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Riley Eugene Daring (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Todd's older sister. She is the kinder, more caring and reliable sibling who enjoys school. She and Todd are the adopted children of K and Dick Daring. She generally uses the Fleemco phone to replace mean or unfair adults, but sometimes she use it for her own selfish purpose. She is a girly girl and enjoys playing [[baseball]], playing the violin, horses, ponies, Hornet Hive Scouts, candy, and pretty much any form of sugar. At one point, she was part of the [[Journalism]] staff at school. She has a crush on Johnny Hitswell and they became a couple in season 2. But in \"Heartbreak in the City\", Johnny broke up with her because of her controlling demeanor. She claims she is over him, despite many people who claim otherwise.  She has an imaginary unicorn friend named Rainbow Jumper. She gets a B average in school. She prefers playing country fiddle/country rock on the violin. Riley is a fan of Susie May, Dustin Dreamlake, and J.J. Baker's. Riley can easily become jealous like when Todd made a fortune off of his \"Gum Art\" and she wasn't with her Unicorn \"Art\". Riley loves reading and the library. Riley had braces when she was younger. Riley also has a mission: Get Todd to do the right thing and be selfless. Sugar makes Riley hyper. In \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\" Riley tries one of her dream careers as a spy instead of a window washer that the Career Day test and the ex-guidance counselor Mr. Leslie told her to be, and almost blows up Antarctica when she stows away on K's mission to stop Dr. Scorpius, but in the end Riley saves the day even though K's mission is too dangerous. In \"She Works Hard For The Movie\" we learn that Riley has an Aunt Debbie and her middle name is Eugene. In \"Ratted out\", she started to sing the very first song of the whole series entitled \"My Rat Buddy\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Karen Mildred \"Agent K\" Daring (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) \u2013 Agent K resembles [[Emma Peel]]. She is the siblings' adoptive British mother and is a superspy. Agent K's height is 6'1 tall. From an outside view it may seem she doesn't care for her kids or husband, but in fact she loves them devotedly, even though she may express it through a recording or videotape. If something is done unfairly, she fixes it very quickly. She is seen to be a terrible cook. Her career as a spy has also made her highly suspicious of anything that is the least bit out-of-place, to the point of [[paranoia]]. In the episode Abra K Dabra!, it is revealed that she has stage fright and that her middle name is Mildred. She also has a habit for thinking all her chores are secret missions. She plays classical violin, which Riley hates and it puts Dick to sleep. K once took karate lessons from the evil Master Pho (Master Foe) to bust his secret evil bank-robbing karate gang. Even though she's just as logical as C.A.R. (albeit less sarcastic and violent), she seems to favor Dick over him. Even though both Dick and Agent K are the replacement adoptive parents, they still seem to be very much in love and care for Riley and Todd as their own children. Her mother is also a secret agent. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Richard Marion \"Dick\" Daring (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 He is the siblings' world-greatest daredevil adoptive father. He is a semi-former stunt artist, and is constantly working on new tricks. His appearance resembles that of [[Evel Knievel]]. He is also rather immature, and is seen having a teddy bear known as \"Evel Bearnievel\". He thinks that C.A.R. is his best friend, though C.A.R. doesn't see it that way. Dick bought Riley a mule named Prince Cinnamon Boots instead of a horse like she wanted. Like Todd, Dick isn't smart at all. In \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\" we learn that Dick is afraid of clowns and tries to force Todd to be a stunt man instead of a circus clown for his career. In \"She Works Hard For The Movie\" we learn that Dick was in a movie back in the 1970s. We also hear Dick sing his first true song; \"Space training Montage\" in \"Space family Daring\". It is also revealed in one episode that he is a better cook than K. His catchphrase is \"Look out below!\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* C.A.R.T.E.R. (voiced by [[David McCallum]]) \u2013 C.A.R.T.E.R. a.k.a. C.A.R. is the high-tech family car with a British accent. He can do just about anything, but is not always willing to do something for the family, especially not for Dick. He often calls Dick a twit, but is often indifferent to him. He does not wish to let Dick drive him, presumably under the assumption that Dick's daredevil habits would cause him to wreck C.A.R.T.E.R. He prefers to use a maneuver called \"The Oslo Option\" to scare Dick, which consists of C.A.R.T.E.R. pulling out a large spinning buzzsaw blade from his hood. The family usually refers to him as simply C.A.R. which is most likely a [[parody]] of K.I.T.T from ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. C.A.R also resembles the [[Mach Five]] from [[Speed Racer]]. In the episode ''Tasumi Unmasked'', C.A.R used to be a one-man band player back when he wanted to join other one-man band members, but was kicked out for not being perfect. They  destroyed his instruments. Also in this episode, he had a goatee, possibly real or not. The goatee was ripped by the other one-man band members. He is sarcastic, witty, and violent. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Conrad Fleem (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])  \u2013 Conrad is the mysterious owner of the Fleemco company. He processes Todd and Riley's requests whenever they call him. He has a very long mustache. In the show his face is never shown until the episode \"Irreplaceble\" where it is also revealed his mustache is red and not black. In a flashback of his it appears he was bullied during his childhood. At the end of the series it is revealed that Conrad is Riley and Todd's long lost uncle; the tip off is when they find out he craves sugar just like Riley and says \"Don't judge me!\" just like Todd after they find out Conrad tells them that he will open up the replacement program to other kids so he asks Riley and Todd to help him. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n\n===Major===\n* Tasumi (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) \u2013 She is Riley's best friend, who is of [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent and has a crush on Jacobo and kissed him revealed in one episode. There is hint of Tasumi's crush on Jacobo in \"The Truth Hurts\" when she passes on a note in the classroom that asks Jacobo if she liked him and was crushed when he signed maybe. She wears a pink metal suit which resembles ''[[RoboCop]]''. But during season 2 she no longer wears her metal suit. She claims her family is part of a crime-fighting team. (parody of ''[[Power Rangers]]''/''[[Super Sentai]]''). She also has a list of people she hates. Riley is either on or off it. In the episode \"Best friends For-Never?\" it appears Riley first meets Tasumi in a broom closet when she was new at school and tried to get to homeroom but got lost. Tasumi was in the broom closet because she split her armor and was embarrassed, but Riley fixed it with the duct tape her dad made her carry. In the episode \"Tasumi Unmasked\", it is revealed that Tasumi is in fact a Japanese pop star. She moved to Pleasant Hills in order to escape the constant adoration of her fans and live a peaceful life, as Pleasant Hills was voted as the least culturally aware town in the world and she believed that nobody there would recognize her. However, in order to make sure that nobody recognized her, she wore a costume from a popular anime and used details from that anime in order to get a new history. That's the reason she always referred to things such as fighting giant monsters and so forth, but in reality, she never did anything of that sort. When her fans found out about this, she moved back to Japan for 2 weeks to record a new album until Riley replaced her band members with orangutans and she got kicked out by her new orangutan members because she has thumbs (even though orangutans do have thumbs). She came back to Pleasant Hills with Riley and no longer wears her metal suit, dumping it in the garbage. Under her metal suit, Tasumi has long black hair and a pretty face complete with a beauty mark. She wears a blue wig with her metal suit. She also has a brother named Roku. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n*Abbey Willson (voiced by [[Erica Hubbard]] in season 1, [[Tempestt Bledsoe]] in season 2) \u2013 She is Riley's other best friend, who is of [[African-American]] descent. Even though she hates the popular girls such as Sierra, she is seen wanting to be a part of them so bad, and has a habit of telling Sierra she is cool, even though she doesn't mean to. It also seems that her parents are rich. She sometimes can be [[hypocritical]]. She has a little sister named Tiffany who dated Todd in the episode \"A Little Tiff\". First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"A Tale of Two Rileys\".\n* Jacobo Jacobo (HA-CO-BO) (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 Todd's best friend who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican]] descent (Though his shirt has the colors of the [[flag of Spain]]). He has a funny looking mouth. Jacobo loves mystery books and has a secret talent for singing. He has a crush on Agent K. He resembles the animated version of [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] from ''[[That '70s Show]]''. He is always trying to win the affections of Agent K, even in the episode, \"Irreplaceable,\" when he started to date Tasumi. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Shelton Gunnar Klutzberry (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Shelton is Todd's other best friend and the stereotypical nerd at school. He is afraid of girls, and once had a relationship with Celebrity Star. He also has an imaginary girlfriend named Zelda (since an imaginary girlfriend is all that he can handle). He often thinks of himself as cool & calls the others nerds. He becomes very muscular and handsome when he takes his glasses off, but this is not to his advantage because he can't use contacts, and has to have heavy glasses (which causes him to appear weak and scrawny). He always seems to be where ever Todd and Riley are. He sometimes just wants to be part of a popular group. In one episode he is seen to have a giant pet tortoise. In another he and his entire family are stated to be [[Jews|Jew]][[Judaism|ish]]. His voice and mannerisms are greatly similar to the famous comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]'s character from the movie \"The Nutty Professor\". When he speaks of characteristics or actions, he clarifies them by saying \"with the\" and adding a list of adjectives and effects (etc. \"Victory is mine... with the winning, and the accomplishing, and the rubbing it in your face!\"). When he gets hurt, he usually says \"Hoigle!\" First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Buzz Winters (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Buzz is a wannabe bully and is Todd's nemesis. He usually makes silly jokes then laughs at them saying \"Good one Buzz!\" and \"I got to start writing these down!\". Although he is normally a bully in some episodes they have put their differences aside and even become friends. Deep down Buzz is jealous of Todd and Riley because their dad is cooler than his dad. Buzz used to have the coolest dad in the neighborhood until Todd and Riley came along. On more than one account Buzz has been mistaken for a wild boar, although, both times, this was by Dingo McGee, on \"Field Trippin'\" and \"Volcano Island\". He also has a taste for crabgrass. Like Todd, Buzz hates school, and he has a habit of cheating. He has many secrets including his love of the theater, and what he calls his only two shames, small feet, and ice skating. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Donny Rottweiler (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2013 Donny is a professional bully who is much taller than Todd, but still attends his school. He is Buzz's mentor and Todd's other nemesis, he is feared because of his giant size. First appeared: \"The Insecurity Guard\". Last appeared: \"A Tale of Two Rileys\". He was also mentioned in \"Irreplaceable\" by Shelton.\n* Johnny Hitswell (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 He is the subject of Riley's affection and her middle school sweet heart. Even though every girl in the school is all over him, he tends to pay no attention to them all times, except for his annual Kumquat Day card readings. He enjoys basketball and baseball, and plays on the same baseball team as Todd and Riley. It is true that he likes Riley, because he asked her out on a date and then kissed her. But in season two he starts dating Riley as boyfriend and girlfriend. In the second season, Johnny breaks up with Riley for being to controlling after she followed him all the way to New York with Abby and Tasumi. He once said in a later episode that she could be smothering as she was in a conversation with her friends. By the end of the series, he actually admits that he wants to get back together with Riley, but he says this while talking to her robot duplicate, and it is never shown if he and Riley do get back together. First appeared: \"Todd Strikes Out\". Last appeared: \"A Tale of Two Rileys\".\n* Sierra McCool (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 She is the popular girl at school, and is Riley's nemesis. She is constantly competing with Riley for the affections of Johnny Hitswell.  In the second season, when Riley and Johnny become a couple, her crush on him persists, and her aim becomes to break them up so she can be Johnny's girlfriend.  She has her own posse (Jennifer and Claudia) and a huge, conceited ego. She is seen to have another side in which, she is infatuated with a ''[[Star Trek]]'' parody mentioned, which Todd also likes. This forges a bond between the two, which doesn't last long when she becomes a cheerleader again. It is mentioned in the series finale that she gets her own Fleemco Phone. She has long black hair in pigtails. First appeared: \"The Jerky Girls\". Last appeared: \"Toddbusters\". She was mentioned in \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Principal Cutler (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 He is the [[Inuit]] principal of George Stapler Middle School. Since he is from [[Alaska]], he allows school on major snow days until Todd and Riley changed it one time. He is also very cheap and cares about money over the students, the school, and the faculty (he saves money for a vacation on Tahiti). First appeared: \"Skate Gate\". Last appeared: \"A Tale of Two Rileys\".\n* Prince Cinnamon Boots (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 The Daring Family's pet mule. He was originally given to Riley by her father when she asked for a show horse. PCB has many talents but is often forgotten by his family after Dick says \"I keep thinking we're forgetting something.\" First appeared: \"The Majestic Horse\". Last appeared: \"Irreplaceable\".\n* Shelly Klutzberry (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 Shelton's older sister who has fewer appearances than her brother. She resembles her brother but doesn't change appearance when her glasses are taken off. In \"Late Night With Todd and Riley\" she is first mentioned as Shelton's sister and also we learn she loves Dustin Dreamlake. Though never mentioned, she presumably already had her [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bat mitzvah]]. First appeared: \"Best Friends Fornever?\". Last appeared: \"R2: A Tale of Two Rileys\".\n* Jennifer and Claudia (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]], [[Erica Hubbard]] and [[Tempestt Bledsoe]]) \u2013 Two blonde-haired twin girls who are normally seen with Sierra McCool. In the episode, \"The Insecurity Guard\" from the first season, a common gag was for the two girls to be commenting on what they are wearing when Todd falls in a mud puddle next to them, ruining their clothes. First appeared: \"The Jerky Girls\". Last appeared: \"A Tale of Two Rileys\"\n\n===Minor and recurring===\n{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=May 2015}}\n<!--It would be ideal to remove non-recurring characters, per MOS:TV. We're not here to detail every character in the series.-->\n* Phil Mygrave (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 Dick's stunt coordinator and brother and uncle to Riley and Todd. He is not very good with measurements, as he doesn't use proper units of measurements, rather just \"tweaking the thingy on the whatchimacallit a smidge\". He has also been married multiple times, and has poor advice for maintaining a relationship. He was twice replaced by Riley. First when Riley felt that his setting up of Dick's stunts were unprofessional and dangerous, and nearly ruins Dick's career by making all his stunts too safe, and second when Riley tried to get Dick a better love coach, and almost ended up costing Dick his stunt secrets. His name is a play on the phrase \"fill my grave\", referring to his shoddy assembly of Dick's stunts, a fact only noticed by C.A.R.T.E.R.

There's usually a running gag that reveals the fact he wears a wig (even by himself).\n* Davey Hunkerhoff (voiced by [[Zac Efron]]) \u2013 A super hot lifeguard (and a younger spoofed version of [[David Hasselhoff]]) that Riley used to make Johnny Hitswell jealous in the episode \"Davey Hunkerhoff\" when he refused to notice her. However, he actually had feelings for Riley, which inevitably led to complications between the two.\n* Skye Blossoms (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 A common replacement.

Riley felt bad and had Zelda replaced with Celebrity who liked nearsighted nerds. She became so annoying that Shelton broke up with her. Even with that she vowed to never let him go causing him to lose his glasses making him a \"complete hottie\", which wasn't her taste and she broke up with him. In contrary to all that there was gossip going around that Shelton broke up with her, which he did. She returned to get revenge on the young nerd by making a movie to dehumanize him.

He is first mentioned in \"Riley's Birthday\" when Agent K convinced Dustin Dreamlake to sing at her party by telling him that she needed his help capturing \"the cleverly disguised spy known as Tiny Evil\". Is not actually seen until a much later episode, (\"Canadian Fakin'\"), where he pretended to be a boy from Canada in order to infiltrate Agent K's secret room of weapons and use them against her, on Dr. Scorpius' orders.\n* Doctor Skorpius (voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]]) \u2013 [[Archenemy]] of Agent K and the main [[antagonist]] of the series. \"Doctor\" is not his title, but his first name, as shown on the address label of his \"Window Washer Weekly\" magazine in \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\" (Mr. Doctor Skorpius, 1 Secret Mountaintop Way). He has a scorpion tail-shaped beard and is usually seen trying to take over the world in some way. He's also known for speaking with a [[lisp]]. In \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley,\", he tried to destroy Antarctica with a giant laser cannon. In another episode, he was seen relaxing on a beach that Todd and Riley happened to be on at the time. In \"The Rizzle\", Todd finds out that he needs glasses, but Agent K thinks he has been infected with \"Dr. Scorpius' Genetically Crafted Island Eye-Fog\". Appeared in \"The Spy Who Wasn't Riley\", \"Canadian Fakin'\", \"Glee by the Sea\", and \"Irreplaceable\". Mentioned in \"CindeRiley\", \"German Squirmin'\", \"The Rizzle\", and \"Private Todd\".\n* Goober and T-Bone (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] and [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2013 Radio DJs who are idolized by Todd. Throughout the show, they will make random appearances where they host radio contests, etc. Usually these contests will involve the Party Peacock in some way. They were replaced by Buzz Winters in the episode \"Phone-less In Pleasant Hills\" when he found Riley's Fleemco phone.\n* Buck Spikes (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])- a tough baseball coach who replaced Todd and Riley's old coach, Pops. Spike keeps pushing kids to the limit, and when they strike out, he cruelly throws them into a cage. Spikes does not appear until the series finale, \"Irreplaceable,\" as one of Dr. Scorpius's minions.\n* 'Puter Dude 13 (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A \"cool and mysterious recluse\" (he's really a nerd) who runs the online interactive game, Fleemster. He was only seen in one episode where he met Todd and Riley after Todd got too obsessed with Fleemster.\n* Heather Hartley \u2013 The \"Her Girl\" for Teen Swoon Magazine. She has an outrageous hairstyle and usually carries around her pet turtle on a leash. According to Tasumi, \"she was on the cover because she was famous, but she was famous for being on the cover\". Anyway, she was replaced by Riley after she finally got sick of everyone at her school emulating her, only to become the new Her Girl herself.\n* Petrov (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 Another enemy of Agent K. Has appeared in a few episodes where he is usually opposed by Agent K and promptly apprehended by her.\n* Dr. Clonemaster \u2013 Yet another Agent K rival. He was seen only in the episode, \"The Means Justify the Trend\", in a flashback of Agent K. The cause of this flashback was Riley attempting to confide in her mother about everyone in her school dressing just like Heather Hartley, (see above). After Riley told her about this, she fears that the evil Dr. Clonemaster is up to his old tricks again, and promptly leaves to fight him.\n* Dingo McGee (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) \u2013 The replacement sent by Fleemco when Todd got sick of an archaeologist treating them like babies on a field trip in the episode \"Field Trippin'\". He's an adventurous, usually reckless, explorer  who plays the [[didgeridoo]]. He also returned in a later episode where he hosted the popular TV show, Volcano Island, in which the families of Buzz Winters, Shelton Klutzberry, and Todd and Riley Daring all competed. He descends from Australia.\n* Robo Fleem SGX (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 A giant security robot that replaced the incompetent security guard at Todd's school in \"The Insecurity Guard\". However, the robot later went crazy and tried to destroy Riley when she tried to return it to Fleemco. This robot is the reason George Washington Middle School became George Stapler Middle School, because it threatened to destroy a teacher if she didn't say Todd was right the George Stapler was the first President of the United States. Its head also makes cameo appearances in the School in the episodes \"Ratted Out\" and \"She Works Hard for the Movies\". Another one was manufactured by Dr. Scorpius in \"Irreplaceable\" to destroy Todd's friends.\n* Mrs. Shusher (voiced by [[Candi Milo]] and [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 The shush-happy librarian at George Stapler Middle School. Todd got sick of her forcing everyone to be quiet, and later replaced her with a librarian who was the complete opposite of her. She returned later in the episode when her replacement was returned by Todd and Riley.\n* Gammazor, Mecha-Gammazor, and Grammazor \u2013 All supposed enemies of Tasumi. There are pictures of them on her \"list\" whenever she brings it out and threatens to put Riley on it. They both possibly descend [[Godzilla]], Mecha-Godzilla, and as a running gag, Grammazor which only appeared in the episode [[List of The Replacements Episodes|Tasumi Unmasked]].\n* Garth the Janitor (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) \u2013 the school janitor that is constantly being replaced by Todd and (more often) Riley when they need a quick replacement. Garth is not very enthusiastic about his job and is extremely lazy. He is also not very bright but seems to know that whenever he inconveniences the Darings, he gets to go somewhere nice (usually). He is also the leader of the school Smite Club and was also one of Doctor Scorpius's minions in \"Irreplaceable.\"\n* Mrs. Fragile (voiced by [[J. P. Manoux]]) \u2013 a replacement who is very fragile. She becomes very upset when Buzz pronounces her name \"fragile\" instead of \"Frah heel leh.\" She also becomes upset when she thinks Riley and Tasumi are acting dumb to take advantage of the substitute teacher.\n\n==Locations==\n*Pleasant Hills \u2013 A typical American town where the show is set.\n* The Fun O' Sphere \u2013 An extremely cool and popular hangout for kids like Todd and Jacobo. It features an arcade and an foreign food court. Todd had his German teacher replaced in order to be allowed to go there in the episode \"German Squirmin'\". In another episode, Buzz bet Todd 100 Fun O' Sphere prize tickets if Todd's dad could beat his dad in the Pleasant Hills Septathalon. Todd then has a vision of him buying a giant T-Rex with his prize tickets.\n* Volcano Island \u2013 An extremely popular reality show where the biggest celebrities, (including Heather Hartley, Ace Palmero, Dustin Dreamlake, and Celebrity Starr) all battle for survival. In a later episode, the Winters, Klutzberry, and Daring families all competed on Volcano Island in a special family edition of the show.\n* Camp Notalottadoe \u2013 A camp with a pretty self-explanatory name that Todd and Riley go to in Season Two of the show. Riley is made a camp counselor and given power over Todd, Shelton, and Buzz, but exploits this power and goes out for a night with other camp counselors, an action that leads to the aforementioned kids getting lost in the woods.\n* Obrich Gardens \u2013 The local zoo in Pleasant Hills which is looked down upon by Riley as it is full of animals shoved into extremely narrowed cages. She later replaces Hiram Smeck, a worker at this zoo (who was very underpaid), which only leads to more trouble as a result. She releases all the animals, and the remainder of the episode was spent getting them back. At the end of the episode, they went to the man in charge of the zoo, Mr. Rottswillow, who, after some coaxing, agreed to let the animals roam free on his golf course instead.\n* The Royal Spy Academy \u2013 A school located in England where people learn how to be spies. This school was attended by Agent K, and is currently run by her mother, Agent B. Todd and Riley secretly enrolled in this school when Agent K's father took C.A.R. back to London with him in the episode \"London Calling\". They later took part in a high-speed chase to get the Spyclopedia back from Clive, C.A.R.'s evil replacement, when it was taken from the Royal Spy Academy.\n* Fleemco \u2013 A company founded in 1989 by Colonel Cadmus K. Fleem, which is currently run today by Conrad Fleem. Fleemco is known for its many consumer products, such as FleemSol, Fleemer steamer, OxiFleem detergent, Fleem Brite toothpaste, Fleem Dream mattresses, FleemPod MP3 player, FleemDows computers, Fleem Star Line, which operates the steamship Fleemtanic, and Fleemsoft fabric softener. It is also known for its many online ventures, including Fleemster, Fleemsody, FleemBay, and Fleembly But by far the most distinguishing characteristic of Fleemco is its ability to replace any given person at any given time, depending on the preference of its customers, of course. However, a customer must have a FleemTel cellphone in order to access this Fleemco service.\n* George Stapler Middle School \u2013 The school that both Todd and Riley attend. It used to be called George Washington Middle School, however the name was changed in the episode \"The Insecurity Guard\" when Todd's Robo Fleem SGX intimidated his teacher into stating that George Stapler was in fact the first president of the United States' real name instead of [[George Washington]].\n* Le Petit Formage \u2013 A French restaurant where Riley went with Johnny Hitswell on a date. Todd's parents later forced him to replace the American waiters there with real waiters from France in an attempt to make Riley's date absolutely perfect. However, this didn't turn out so well, as the French waiters never showed up, and Todd and his parents therefore had to disguise themselves as the waiters instead. The restaurant's name means \"small cheese\" in French.\n* Carlos & Ed's Tacos \u2013 A fast food restaurant that is first seen in \"The Rizzle\" when Todd imagines himself as having glasses. In his imagination, the sun reflects off his glasses and melts different letters off this sign so that it reads \"Closed\". It is again seen in \"A Buzzwork Orange\" in the flashback where Jacobo and Buzz meet.\n* Uncle Scorpion's Taco Shack \u2013 A restaurant in Spain. Agent K travels here as she believes that this is a cleverly disguised hideout of Dr. Scorpius.\n* Pleasant Pop Popcorn \u2013 Another restaurant in Pleasant Hills that Todd destroyed with the heat vision coming from his gigantic glasses (only in his imagination, of course).\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran originally from July 28, 2006 to March 30, 2009 on [[Disney Channel]] in the United States.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', W. W. Norton, 2012, pp. 49-60. {{ISBN|978-0393073676}}</ref> The creative activity  that produced ''Liber Novus'' came in this period, from 1913 to about 1917.\n\nBiographers and critics have disagreed whether these years in Jung's life should be seen as \"a creative illness\", a period of introspection, a psychotic break, or simply madness.\"<ref>Lance S.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescaline.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six  journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using calligraphic pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', W. W. Norton, 2012, pp. 49-60. {{ISBN|978-0393073676}}</ref> The creative activity  that produced ''Liber Novus'' came in this period, from 1913 to about 1917.\n\nBiographers and critics have disagreed whether these years in Jung's life should be seen as \"a creative illness\", a period of introspection, a psychotic break, or simply madness.\"<ref>Lance S.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescaline.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six  journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using calligraphic pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pg. 119n.</ref> About a third of the manuscript material he had written was never entered into the illuminated Red Book. Inside the book now are 205 completed pages of text and illustrations (including the loose parchment sheets), all from Jung's hand:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/carl-jungs-red-book/|title=Carl Jung's Red Book|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2009-09-20|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> 53 full-page images, 71 pages with both text and artwork, and 81 pages entirely of calligraphic text.\n\nThe Red Book is currently held, along with other valuable and private items from Jung's archive, in a bank vault in Zurich.\n\n==Publication and display==\nDuring Jung's life, several people saw his Red Book \u2014 it was often present in his office \u2014 but only a very few individuals who were personally trusted by Jung had an opportunity to read it.
