Because they were minted to the official specifications of the 5 francs coin, they were nevertheless circulated ''de facto''.<ref>[http://www.swissmint.ch/d/downloads/aktuell/FAQ-de.pdf Swissmint FAQ], p. 9, citing ''Revue Suisse de Numismatique'', 1894, p. 56.</ref>\nAfter 1885, the federal mint was dissuaded from minting these semi-official coins on the part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]]. After the demise of the Monetary Union, the Swiss federal mint issued two further Sch\u00fctzentaler, in 1934 and 1939. Of the [[cantons of Switzerland|22 cantons]] of the [[Switzerland_as_a_federal_state|Swiss Confederation]], \n18 are represented in these coins, the exceptions being [[canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Appenzell]], [[Aargau]] and [[Valais]].<ref>Z\u00fcrich (1859, 1872) and Bern (1857, 1885) are represented twice; [[Unterwalden]] is represented with [[Stans]] ([[Nidwalden]]).  \nCantons represented by cities other than their capitals are [[Ticino]] (with [[Lugano]]) and [[canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] (with [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]]). \nThe festival in [[Aarau]] ([[Aargau]]) of 1849 was held just before the federal mint became operative and again in 1924, when it had ceased to issue shooting thalers. \nFestivals in Lucerne were held in 1832 and 1901, with a federal issue ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' minted only for the third event in 1939. The small cantons of Uri and Appenzell have never hosted a federal festival, the canton of Valais for the first time only in 2015.</ref>\n\nIn a somewhat wider sense, the term ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' is extended to non-official silver [[commemorative coins]] of thaler size, minted privately for the federal festivals between 1890 and 1929 and from 1949 to present, as well as for numerous [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] festivals. \n\nMost shooting thaler designs depict strongly cantonal or patriotic themes, such as historical military leaders or [[heraldry]]. The 1851 coin minted by Geneva and the 1855 coin minted by the Swiss federal mint for the [[Solothurn]]  festival of 1855 are identical in design to their regular  [[Circulation (currency)|circulating]] counterparts.\n\nThe entire series can be distinguished from the much more varied genre of shooting medals (''Sch\u00fctzenmedaillen'') by their adherence  to the specifications of circulating coinage (with the exception of the three cantonal speciments, the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]]). All but the [[Stans]] (1861) and [[St. Gallen]] (1874) issues are denominated. \nMany nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and [[white metal]], in small quantities. \n\n== History ==\nThe first shooting [[medal]]s were struck in honor of the Officers' Shoot held in [[Langenthal, Switzerland|Langenthal]], Bern, in 1822.<ref name=twentythree>Krause, p. 11</ref><ref name=twentytwo>Krause, p. 10</ref> Shooting medals  continued to be made in great numbers, minted in a variety of metals, including silver, [[bronze]], goldene and white metal.<ref name=twentythree/>\n\nThe first shooting thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by the sovereign cantons of Switzerland.

The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses.<ref name= \"one\"/> \nThe federal festival, and with it the production of shooting thalers, was interrupted by  the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"three\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgs.com/news/Swiss-Shooting-Thalers|title=Swiss Shooting Thalers|last=Searis|first=BJ|website=[[Professional Coin Grading Service]]|accessdate=2015-02-27}}</ref> \n\nFor the federal festivals of 1949 to 1977, commemorative coins were made but not to official specifications.\nWith the rising popularity of collecting commemorative coins in the 1980s, fine silver coins dubbed ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' have been privately issued for cantonal and federal festivals. \n\n==  Cantonal issues ==\n\n=== Chur (1842) ===\n\n{{multiple image\n   | width     = 150\n   | image1    = graubundenobv.jpg|\n   | alt1      = Obverse of coin.

Because they were minted to the official specifications of the 5 francs coin, they were nevertheless circulated ''de facto''.<ref>[http://www.swissmint.ch/d/downloads/aktuell/FAQ-de.pdf Swissmint FAQ], p. 9, citing ''Revue Suisse de Numismatique'', 1894, p. 56.</ref>\nAfter 1885, the federal mint was dissuaded from minting these semi-official coins on the part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]]. After the demise of the Monetary Union, the Swiss federal mint issued two further Sch\u00fctzentaler, in 1934 and 1939. Of the [[cantons of Switzerland|22 cantons]] of the [[Switzerland_as_a_federal_state|Swiss Confederation]], \n18 are represented in these coins, the exceptions being [[canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Appenzell]], [[Aargau]] and [[Valais]].<ref>Z\u00fcrich (1859, 1872) and Bern (1857, 1885) are represented twice; [[Unterwalden]] is represented with [[Stans]] ([[Nidwalden]]).  \nCantons represented by cities other than their capitals are [[Ticino]] (with [[Lugano]]) and [[canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] (with [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]]). \nThe festival in [[Aarau]] ([[Aargau]]) of 1849 was held just before the federal mint became operative and again in 1924, when it had ceased to issue shooting thalers. \nFestivals in Lucerne were held in 1832 and 1901, with a federal issue ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' minted only for the third event in 1939. The small cantons of Uri and Appenzell have never hosted a federal festival, the canton of Valais for the first time only in 2015.</ref>\n\nIn a somewhat wider sense, the term ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' is extended to non-official silver [[commemorative coins]] of thaler size, minted privately for the federal festivals between 1890 and 1929 and from 1949 to present, as well as for numerous [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] festivals. \n\nMost shooting thaler designs depict strongly cantonal or patriotic themes, such as historical military leaders or [[heraldry]]. The 1851 coin minted by Geneva and the 1855 coin minted by the Swiss federal mint for the [[Solothurn]]  festival of 1855 are identical in design to their regular  [[Circulation (currency)|circulating]] counterparts.\n\nThe entire series can be distinguished from the much more varied genre of shooting medals (''Sch\u00fctzenmedaillen'') by their adherence  to the specifications of circulating coinage (with the exception of the three cantonal speciments, the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]]). All but the [[Stans]] (1861) and [[St. Gallen]] (1874) issues are denominated. \nMany nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and [[white metal]], in small quantities. \n\n== History ==\nThe first shooting [[medal]]s were struck in honor of the Officers' Shoot held in [[Langenthal, Switzerland|Langenthal]], Bern, in 1822.<ref name=twentythree>Krause, p. 11</ref><ref name=twentytwo>Krause, p. 10</ref> Shooting medals  continued to be made in great numbers, minted in a variety of metals, including silver, [[bronze]], goldene and white metal.<ref name=twentythree/>\n\nThe first shooting thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by the sovereign cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, as well as the 1855 [[Solothurn]] issue, were strictly legal tender.<ref name=\"one\">Bruce, p. 455</ref> Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five [[Swiss franc|francs]].<ref name=\"one\"/> Beginning in 1865, Switzerland became a member of the [[Latin Monetary Union]].<ref name=\"two\">[[Peter Kenen|Kenen, Peter B.]] & Meade, Ellen E. (2008). ''Regional Monetary Integration'' [[Cambridge, United Kingdom]]: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-86250-7}}</ref> Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. \nTherefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues.<ref name=\"one\"/> This series of shooting thalers, following the standards of the Latin Monetary Union, began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the [[Bern]] issue.<ref name = \"one\"/> \n\nAlthough the term ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' is mostly reserved for the Swiss tradition, some German mints in the 19th century have also issued commemorative coins for ''Sch\u00fctzenfeste''.

Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \"pink dot\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Pink Dot SG|url=http://pinkdot.sg/about-pink-dot/|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> In addition to the titular formation, Pink Dot events usually feature concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations supporting the LGBT community and cause.\n\nOther Pink Dot events followed in several other cities, so that the Singapore event became known as Pink Dot SG. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] on a Saturday in May, June or July. The 2019 event was held on 29 June.\n\n==History==\nIn September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] at [[Hong Lim Park]] were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | title=Singapore Statutes Online - 493 - Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 | publisher=Statutes.agc.gov.sg | accessdate=2 September 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072855/http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | archivedate=18 May 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all}}</ref> This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009. A total of nine Pink Dot events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in May, June or July. Many organisations around the world modeled LGBT events after the Pink Dot concept, often borrowing the \"Pink Dot\" prefix. For distinction, the Singapore events became known as Pink Dot SG.\n\nThe design of the Pink Dot SG mascot \"Pinkie\", a personification of the pink dot, was provided by graphic designer Soh Ee Shaun.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pinkdot.sg Mascot|url=http://www.gardensilly.com/projects/2009/pinkdot.sg-mascot|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mulangallery.com.sg/src/pdf/Lookin%20In%20is%20the%20Only%20Way%20Out-catalogue.pdf | title=Looking in is the Only Way Out | accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nEach event from 2009 to 2019 took place on a Saturday at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park.\n\n===Pink Dot SG 2009===\nPink Dot SG 2009 was held on 16 May, launched with a campaign video titled \"RED + WHITE = PINK\".

One response to the event was FamFest, or the Red Dot Family Movement, which was organised by LoveSingapore, a network of Singaporean churches. FamFest was initially planned to be held on the same day as Pink Dot 2014 at the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. However, the event was cancelled after its application was rejected by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which deemed the location unsuitable. FamFest continued as a virtual rally on Facebook.\n\nIn response to the appearance of a Muslim woman in the Pink Dot SG 2014 campaign video, Islamic religious teacher Ustaz Noor Deros called for a Wear White campaign in defence of traditional Islamic values. Notably, an evening prayer marking the fasting month coincided with the Pink Dot SG 2014 event. [[Faith Community Baptist Church]] (FCBC) and the LoveSingapore network of churches also called on their members to join local Muslims in the campaign to dress in white,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/06/christians-join-muslims-in-protest-against-pink-dot/|title=Christians join Muslims in protest against Pink Dot|author=Howard Lee|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> and worshipers at the mosque and the two churches were seen wearing white in the days following the event.\n\nIn light of possible unrest, security personnel were deployed at Pink Dot SG 2014 for crowd management purposes.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\"/> However, the event proceeded without interference, with Wear White campaign organisers telling supporters to keep at a distance from the Pink Dot gathering and the FCBC announcing that its members did not intend to picket the event.<ref name=\"todayonline.com\"/>\n\nSince 2014, Pink Dot has continued to experience opposition from the Wear White campaign.\n\n===Other religious groups and Pink Dot 2014===\nLeading up to Pink Dot SG 2014, and in response to other reactions about the event, other religious groups in Singapore made statements about their stands on LGBT issues.\n\nOn behalf of the Muslim community, the [[Islamic Religious Council of Singapore]] (MUIS) advised Muslims not to be confrontational towards the LGBT community. The MUIS indicated that it does not approve of the \"pervasiveness\" of the LGBT lifestyle, but cautioned against mosques being involved in the Pink Dot or Wear White initiatives. Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] issued a statement saying that Singaporeans who wanted to express support for a cause or lifestyle choice should express it in a way that does not divide the community. He emphasized tolerance and the need \"to keep the social fabric as tight as possible\".<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040832/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) stated:  The Council also wishes to state that while it does not condone homosexual or bi-sexual practices, it also does not condemn those who are struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html|title=National council of churches issues statement on Pink Dot controversy |accessdate=29 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628180817/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Catholic Church, Archbishop [[William Goh]] stated:\n{{quote|This kind of lifestyle should not be promoted by Catholics as it is detrimental to society, is not helpful to integral human development and contrary to Christian values.

The involvement of corporations in the local LGBT scene drew criticism from various socially conservative groups.\n\nIn 2015 furniture retailer [[IKEA]], upon receiving feedback from pro-LGBT groups, announced a review of its support for a magic show staged by a pastor known for his views against homosexuality. The pastor was also responsible for previous anti-Pink Dot movements, while IKEA is known globally to be a supporter of the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/04/magic-shows-ikea-and-the-corporatisation-of-lgbt-politics/|title=Magic shows, Ikea and the corporatisation of LGBT politics|author=Terry Xu|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/ikea-singapore-reviewing-support-pastors-magic-show-afte|title=Ikea Singapore reviewing support for pastor's magic show after backlash from gay rights groups|author=RACHEL AU-YONG|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> However, after the review, IKEA Singapore decided to continue support for the magic show.

Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \"pink dot\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Pink Dot SG|url=http://pinkdot.sg/about-pink-dot/|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> In addition to the titular formation, Pink Dot events usually feature concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations supporting the LGBT community and cause.\n\nOther Pink Dot events followed in several other cities, so that the Singapore event became known as Pink Dot SG. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] on a Saturday in May, June or July. The 2019 event was held on 29 June.\n\n==History==\nIn September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's [[Speakers' Corner, Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] at [[Hong Lim Park]] were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | title=Singapore Statutes Online - 493 - Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) (No. 2) Order 2011 | publisher=Statutes.agc.gov.sg | accessdate=2 September 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072855/http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=Id%3A31e337a2-e2e5-40ea-8acb-d82a4aa62083;rec=0 | archivedate=18 May 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all}}</ref> This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009.

One response to the event was FamFest, or the Red Dot Family Movement, which was organised by LoveSingapore, a network of Singaporean churches. FamFest was initially planned to be held on the same day as Pink Dot 2014 at the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. However, the event was cancelled after its application was rejected by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which deemed the location unsuitable. FamFest continued as a virtual rally on Facebook.\n\nIn response to the appearance of a Muslim woman in the Pink Dot SG 2014 campaign video, Islamic religious teacher Ustaz Noor Deros called for a Wear White campaign in defence of traditional Islamic values. Notably, an evening prayer marking the fasting month coincided with the Pink Dot SG 2014 event. [[Faith Community Baptist Church]] (FCBC) and the LoveSingapore network of churches also called on their members to join local Muslims in the campaign to dress in white,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/06/christians-join-muslims-in-protest-against-pink-dot/|title=Christians join Muslims in protest against Pink Dot|author=Howard Lee|website=The Online Citizen|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> and worshipers at the mosque and the two churches were seen wearing white in the days following the event.\n\nIn light of possible unrest, security personnel were deployed at Pink Dot SG 2014 for crowd management purposes.<ref name=\"channelnewsasia.com\"/> However, the event proceeded without interference, with Wear White campaign organisers telling supporters to keep at a distance from the Pink Dot gathering and the FCBC announcing that its members did not intend to picket the event.<ref name=\"todayonline.com\"/>\n\nSince 2014, Pink Dot has continued to experience opposition from the Wear White campaign.\n\n===Other religious groups and Pink Dot 2014===\nLeading up to Pink Dot SG 2014, and in response to other reactions about the event, other religious groups in Singapore made statements about their stands on LGBT issues.\n\nOn behalf of the Muslim community, the [[Islamic Religious Council of Singapore]] (MUIS) advised Muslims not to be confrontational towards the LGBT community. The MUIS indicated that it does not approve of the \"pervasiveness\" of the LGBT lifestyle, but cautioned against mosques being involved in the Pink Dot or Wear White initiatives. Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] issued a statement saying that Singaporeans who wanted to express support for a cause or lifestyle choice should express it in a way that does not divide the community. He emphasized tolerance and the need \"to keep the social fabric as tight as possible\".<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040832/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/church-must-work-with/1199056.html|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) stated:  The Council also wishes to state that while it does not condone homosexual or bi-sexual practices, it also does not condemn those who are struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html|title=National council of churches issues statement on Pink Dot controversy |accessdate=29 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628180817/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-council-of/1208378.html |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Catholic Church, Archbishop [[William Goh]] stated:\n{{quote|This kind of lifestyle should not be promoted by Catholics as it is detrimental to society, is not helpful to integral human development and contrary to Christian values.

A river may have multiple channels, or [[anabranch]]es. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be clear how to measure the length through a lake. Seasonal and annual changes may alter both rivers and lakes. Other factors that can change the length of a river include cycles of erosion and flooding, dams, levees, and [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]]. In addition, the length of [[meander]]s can change significantly over time due to natural or artificial [[Avulsion (river)#Meander cutoffs|cutoffs]], when a new channel cuts across a narrow strip of land, bypassing a large river bend. For example, due to 18 cutoffs created between 1766 and 1885, the length of the Mississippi River from [[Cairo, Illinois]], to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was reduced by {{convert|218|mi|km}}.<ref name=US/>\n\nThese points make it difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate measurement of the length of a river. The varying accuracy and precision also makes it difficult to make length comparisons between different rivers without a degree of uncertainty.\n\n==List of river systems longer than 1000 km==\n{{Original research section|date=May 2017}}\n{{Synthesis|date=June 2009}}\nOne should take the aforementioned discussion into account when using the data in the following table.

If the difference in lengths between given information sources is significant, all lengths are listed. But if the lengths from secondary information sources are similar, they are averaged and that figure has an asterisk.\n*Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the [[Ilha de Maraj\u00f3]] at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate [[Tocantins River]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6759291.stm New evidence], (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the [[Andes]], claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100&nbsp;km, with its longest [[headwater]] being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the [[Nevado Mismi]] mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the [[R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac]]\".<ref>[[Daily Telegraph]], Monday 18 June 2007, page 18</ref> However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see [http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz Jacek Palkiewicz]), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400&nbsp;km.\n*Generally, the most commonly used/anglicised name of the river is used.

That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that it was [[Rejuvenation (river)|rejuvenated]] by much of its lower course being removed. Before Africa split from South America when [[Gondwanaland]] broke up due to [[continental drift]], the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===West Siberian Glacial Lake drainage===\n{{main|West Siberian Glacial Lake}}\nThis river would have been about {{convert|10,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, in the last [[Ice Age]].

At this time, the [[River Thames|Thames]], the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], the [[Scheldt River|Scheldt]], and the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] probably joined before flowing into the sea, in a system known by [[palaeogeographer]]s as the [[Loubourg River|Loubourg or Lobourg River System]].<ref>Vaikm\u00e4e, R., Edmunds, W.

The former hypothesis would have produced a shorter river, some {{convert|1,400|km|mi}} in length.

A river may have multiple channels, or [[anabranch]]es. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be clear how to measure the length through a lake. Seasonal and annual changes may alter both rivers and lakes. Other factors that can change the length of a river include cycles of erosion and flooding, dams, levees, and [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]]. In addition, the length of [[meander]]s can change significantly over time due to natural or artificial [[Avulsion (river)#Meander cutoffs|cutoffs]], when a new channel cuts across a narrow strip of land, bypassing a large river bend. For example, due to 18 cutoffs created between 1766 and 1885, the length of the Mississippi River from [[Cairo, Illinois]], to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was reduced by {{convert|218|mi|km}}.<ref name=US/>\n\nThese points make it difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate measurement of the length of a river.

If the difference in lengths between given information sources is significant, all lengths are listed. But if the lengths from secondary information sources are similar, they are averaged and that figure has an asterisk.\n*Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the [[Ilha de Maraj\u00f3]] at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate [[Tocantins River]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6759291.stm New evidence], (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the [[Andes]], claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100&nbsp;km, with its longest [[headwater]] being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the [[Nevado Mismi]] mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the [[R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac]]\".<ref>[[Daily Telegraph]], Monday 18 June 2007, page 18</ref> However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see [http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz Jacek Palkiewicz]), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400&nbsp;km.\n*Generally, the most commonly used/anglicised name of the river is used.

That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that it was [[Rejuvenation (river)|rejuvenated]] by much of its lower course being removed. Before Africa split from South America when [[Gondwanaland]] broke up due to [[continental drift]], the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===West Siberian Glacial Lake drainage===\n{{main|West Siberian Glacial Lake}}\nThis river would have been about {{convert|10,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, in the last [[Ice Age]].

At this time, the [[River Thames|Thames]], the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], the [[Scheldt River|Scheldt]], and the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] probably joined before flowing into the sea, in a system known by [[palaeogeographer]]s as the [[Loubourg River|Loubourg or Lobourg River System]].<ref>Vaikm\u00e4e, R., Edmunds, W.

If the latter hypothesis is true, the Rhine would have attained a length of close to {{convert|1,650|km|mi}}. The former hypothesis would have produced a shorter river, some {{convert|1,400|km|mi}} in length.

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

In the other hand, in the northern village of \u017dejane, the only other one in which Istro-Romanian is spoken, ''jeian\u021bi'' or ''\u017eej\u00e5nci'' is used for the people and ''jeianski'', ''\u017eejanski'' or ''po jeianski cuvinta'' for the language.

This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]].

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]].

Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.
