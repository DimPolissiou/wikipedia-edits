Murrow]] during his time at the network, most notably in the years before and during [[World War II]].\n\nMurrow recruited a number of newsmen and women to CBS during his years as a correspondent, European news chief, and executive. The \"Boys\" were his closest professional and personal associates. They also shared Murrow's preference for incisive, thought-provoking coverage of public affairs, abroad and at home. They achieved nationwide fame, and inadvertently became early examples of \"celebrity journalism\" in the days of radio and early television news.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cloud|first1=Stanley|last2=Olson|first2=Lynne|title=Modern Celebrity Journalism is Born|journal=The American Enterprise|date=March 1996|pages=32-33|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmEnterprise-1996mar-00032?View=PDF|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The original \"Boys\"==\nThe individuals most often cited as Murrow Boys are those who worked for and with him covering the war for the [[CBS News Radio|CBS Radio Network]].

They had significant autonomy in filing reports, and while they had been influential in developing the field of radio news broadcasting, they were reluctant to make the transition to television. The Murrow Boys earned far more working in radio than they could in television, and they resented the process of lights, cameras, makeup, and other aspects of TV broadcasting. By the 1950s their dominating presence in the field had begun to decline.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Jim|title=Say Goodnight, Gracie: The Last Years of Network Radio|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786462396|pages=49-50}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, many in the core group stayed with CBS throughout the 1950s.

He maintained close friendships with the correspondents he hired during the war, and spent much of his free time with them.
