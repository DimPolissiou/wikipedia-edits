Kicking in a locked door is also sometimes attempted or performed by neighbors and ordinary passers-by who witness an emergency situation such as a house that is on fire (though the first step should always be to call [[emergency services]]) in order to ensure that everyone is out of the house or to notify/assist anyone who is not.

Using specialized tools (i.e.: [[A-tool]], [[K-tool]]), a lock cylinder can also be quickly dismantled and unlocked without removing it from the door; this method also allows the door to be closed and re-locked. Mechanical breaching also includes hydraulic breaching, which uses a special hydraulic ram to overcome the lock. The hydraulic ram may be powered manually, pneumatically, or electrically. More dynamic methods (kinetic breaching) use force to break the lock or door. The common methods are to use a lever, such as a [[Halligan bar]] or [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], or to use a tool to concentrate a large amount of force on the door, such as a [[sledgehammer]], [[hydraulic jack]], or [[battering ram]].<ref name=trmag>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hendonpub.com/publications/tacticalresponse/forcedentry.aspx |title=Action Target\u2019s Tactical Breach Door |author=Don Munson |journal=Tactical Response Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firerescue1.com/fire-products/Emergency-Response-Tools/articles/288215-Back-to-Basics-Forcible-Entry/ |title=Back to Basics: Forcible Entry |last1=LaFemina |first1=Fred |website=FireRescue1 |access-date=11 September 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ballistic ===\n[[File:Ballistic breach fm3-06-11fig3-26.gif|thumb|left|Suggested target locations for breaching a door at the latch (left) and the hinges (right)]]\nBallistic breaching uses a projectile weapon to breach an opening.

Of the available shotgun ammunition, [[shotgun slug]]s pose the highest risk, as they will retain significant energy to cause lethal wounds well after they have penetrated the door. Buckshot is far safer and [[birdshot]] even more so, as the multiple small projectiles disperse quickly after penetration, reducing the chances of causing a lethal wound.

The two are separated by around 1.5&nbsp;miles with Cliftonville based at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] on Cliftonville Road and Crusaders at [[Seaview (football ground)|Seaview]] on the [[Shore Road, Belfast|Shore Road]].\n\nThe rivalry between the two clubs began in 1949 with Crusaders' ascension to senior football. For the majority of years the rivalry was simply competitive and geographical. The rivalry was heightened during [[The Troubles]], and as the religious and political demographics within Belfast changed, Cliftonville began to develop a mainly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] following and Crusaders a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] following. While there have been unsavoury incidents in the past between the clubs and the rivalry is fierce and intense on the pitch, off the pitch they have developed a strong cross-community relationship in recent years.\n\nThe two sides have met each other on 296 occasions, and have met in three national cup finals (the [[2008\u201309 Irish Cup|2009 Irish Cup final]], [[2012\u201313 Irish League Cup|2013 League Cup final]] and [[2013\u201314 Northern Ireland Football League Cup|2014 League Cup final]]) and one regional cup final (the 1979 [[County Antrim Shield]] final). The two sides have also won twelve [[NIFL Premiership|league titles]] between them, five of these wins coming in six seasons; Cliftonville winning in [[2012\u201313 IFA Premiership|2012\u201313]] and [[2013\u201314 NIFL Premiership|2013\u201314]], and Crusaders winning in [[2014\u201315 NIFL Premiership|2014\u201315]], [[2015\u201316 NIFL Premiership|2015\u201316]] and [[2017\u201318 NIFL Premiership|2017\u201318]].\n\nBoth clubs also share rivalries with the Belfast [[Belfast's Big Two|'Big Two']] of [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] and [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], but the success disparity between the pairs of clubs has seen two distinct rivalries formed.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1879, Cliftonville are [[Ireland]]'s oldest football team, and along with [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]], Glentoran and Linfield were founder members of the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]], and are one of three teams never to have been relegated and to have competed in every top-flight season (along with Glentoran and Linfield). Although a major force in the first 20 years of Irish football their strict amateur status (not dropped until the early 1970s) meant they were also-rans for long periods once professionalism took hold. Once professional they added a cup win in 1979 and a league title in late 1990s.\n\n[[File:Belfast Cliftonville-Crusaders map.png|thumb|right|400px|Location of Solitude (left) and Seaview in North Belfast]]\nFounded in 1898, Crusaders applied unsuccessfully for many years to join the Irish League and became one of the top junior sides in the country, but it was not until 1949-50 season following the resignation of [[Belfast Celtic F.C.|Belfast Celtic]] they finally entered the league. They endured a tough start but became a major side during the 1960s, winning two [[Irish Cup]]s, and also having successful spells in the 1970s and 1990s, winning two league titles in each decade.\n\nThe first match between the two clubs took place on 13 January 1923 in the first round of the [[County Antrim Shield]] at Solitude; this was also Crusaders first ever match in senior competition. The senior side of Cliftonville was too good for the intermediate Crusaders team, with the Reds recording a 1-0 victory. The first game between the two sides as senior teams took place in the [[Ulster Cup]] on 17 September 1949, finishing in a 2-2 draw at Solitude. The first league match and Boxing Day derby took place on 26 December 1949, with Cliftonville emerging victorious with a 5-0 victory at Seaview. In 1979 at the height of [[The Troubles]], there were more than 1,900 police officers on duty for the Ulster Cup match on 21 September between Crusaders and Cliftonville at Seaview, more than has ever been recorded at a football match in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.community-relations.org.uk/about-us/news/item/686/memories-of-belfast-celtic-reawakened-as-ifa-tries-to-soothe-old-wounds|title=Memories of Belfast Celtic re-awakened as IFA tries to soothe old wounds|publisher=community-relations.org.uk|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://redblackredwhitegreenwhite.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/the-emergence-of-cliftonvilles-red-army-resistance-identity-and-football-in-1970s-north-belfast/|title=The emergence of Cliftonville's Red Army resistance: identity and football in 1970s North Belfast|publisher=redblackredwhitegreenwhite.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe sides first played each other in a cup final in 1978-79, with Cliftonville winning the [[County Antrim Shield]] in a penalty shoot-out, but with Glentoran and Linfield dominating Northern Irish football the sides did not reach a national cup final together until the 2008-09 season when they met in the final of the [[2008\u201309 Irish Cup]]. Crusaders won the match 1 &ndash; 0 in front of 7,500 fans at Windsor Park. It would be not long before the two met again in a cup final as in the 2012-13 season with the sides first and second in the league table they played each other in the final of the [[2012\u201313 Irish League Cup]] with Cliftonville emphatically winning 4 &ndash; 0 at Windsor Park. The following season they played again the League Cup Final but this time in a more cagey affair. Finishing 0 &ndash; 0 after extra time Cliftonville retained the cup with a 3 &ndash; 2 win on penalties.\n\nA fixture during the 2012-13 season came to national media attention after a game was cancelled due to a [[Belfast City Hall flag protests|Loyalist flag protest]]. Going into the fixture on 16 February 2013 Cliftonville led the Irish Premier League with a twelve-point lead, Crusaders in second had a game in hand and hoped a win over their rivals could see them falter. A small group of 20 flag protesters turned up half an hour before kick off and engaged in skirmishes with police. Around 2000 fans were in attendance but many supporters were unable to enter due to the protesters outside the turnstiles. The decision was made to cancel the game with condemnation of the protesters tactics and police's handling of the situation. Due to fixture congestion it was not rearranged until 22 April by which time Cliftonville had long won the title. Despite praise for both clubs during the incident further controversy emerged for the rearranged fixture when Crusaders on advice of the police only offered 200 tickets for away supporters (around 800 would be normal). Cliftonville fans issued a boycott of fixture (seven tickets were purchased, presumably to ticket stub collectors) leaving a completely empty away stand and total attendance of just 395.\n\nIn September 2018 the derby was chosen to be the first live [[NIFL Premiership]] match to be shown on BBC Two Northern Ireland, a part of a three year deal between [[BBC Sport|BBC Sport NI]], the [[Irish Football Association]] and [[Northern Ireland Football League]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/irish-fa-nifl|title=BBC Sport NI signs new three-year live football deal with the Irish FA and NIFL|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\nTraditionally Cliftonville's support was less polarised and they were seen as a cross community team in comparison to Crusaders, who had traditionally been regarded as a Unionist club. During the troubles the Cliftonville support came to be regarded as a [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] due to their location along the Cliftonville Road. With road blocks and cross community violence meaning that many away supporters no longer felt safe venturing to Solitude or Seaview. However, in recent years, with the streets safer than before, many supporters of both away teams choose to walk to their opponent's ground, given the close proximity of the grounds and the fact that both teams have largely local supports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-7.htm |title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the community differences the rivalry between supporters is fairly amicable and brings financial benefits to both clubs. A sell out league fixture can bring in an income of \u00a330,000. As is the tradition with many other derbies in the Irish League, each season a fixture is played on [[Boxing Day]], unless this day falls on a [[Sunday]].\n\n==Head-to-head==\nIn results between the two teams, Crusaders have 152 victories to Cliftonville's 85. Crusaders have won more games in the league, [[County Antrim Shield]], [[Ulster Cup]] and the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]], whereas Cliftonville have won more head-to heads in the [[Irish Cup]], [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup|League Cup]], [[Setanta Sports Cup]], [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] and Belfast Charity Cup.

The two are separated by around 1.5&nbsp;miles with Cliftonville based at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] on Cliftonville Road and Crusaders at [[Seaview (football ground)|Seaview]] on the [[Shore Road, Belfast|Shore Road]].\n\nThe rivalry between the two clubs began in 1949 with Crusaders' ascension to senior football. For the majority of years the rivalry was simply competitive and geographical. The rivalry was heightened during [[The Troubles]], and as the religious and political demographics within Belfast changed, Cliftonville began to develop a mainly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] following and Crusaders a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] following. While there have been unsavoury incidents in the past between the clubs and the rivalry is fierce and intense on the pitch, off the pitch they have developed a strong cross-community relationship in recent years.\n\nThe two sides have met each other on 296 occasions, and have met in three national cup finals (the [[2008\u201309 Irish Cup|2009 Irish Cup final]], [[2012\u201313 Irish League Cup|2013 League Cup final]] and [[2013\u201314 Northern Ireland Football League Cup|2014 League Cup final]]) and one regional cup final (the 1979 [[County Antrim Shield]] final). The two sides have also won twelve [[NIFL Premiership|league titles]] between them, five of these wins coming in six seasons; Cliftonville winning in [[2012\u201313 IFA Premiership|2012\u201313]] and [[2013\u201314 NIFL Premiership|2013\u201314]], and Crusaders winning in [[2014\u201315 NIFL Premiership|2014\u201315]], [[2015\u201316 NIFL Premiership|2015\u201316]] and [[2017\u201318 NIFL Premiership|2017\u201318]].\n\nBoth clubs also share rivalries with the Belfast [[Belfast's Big Two|'Big Two']] of [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] and [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], but the success disparity between the pairs of clubs has seen two distinct rivalries formed.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1879, Cliftonville are [[Ireland]]'s oldest football team, and along with [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]], Glentoran and Linfield were founder members of the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]], and are one of three teams never to have been relegated and to have competed in every top-flight season (along with Glentoran and Linfield). Although a major force in the first 20 years of Irish football their strict amateur status (not dropped until the early 1970s) meant they were also-rans for long periods once professionalism took hold. Once professional they added a cup win in 1979 and a league title in late 1990s.\n\n[[File:Belfast Cliftonville-Crusaders map.png|thumb|right|400px|Location of Solitude (left) and Seaview in North Belfast]]\nFounded in 1898, Crusaders applied unsuccessfully for many years to join the Irish League and became one of the top junior sides in the country, but it was not until 1949-50 season following the resignation of [[Belfast Celtic F.C.|Belfast Celtic]] they finally entered the league. They endured a tough start but became a major side during the 1960s, winning two [[Irish Cup]]s, and also having successful spells in the 1970s and 1990s, winning two league titles in each decade.\n\nThe first match between the two clubs took place on 13 January 1923 in the first round of the [[County Antrim Shield]] at Solitude; this was also Crusaders first ever match in senior competition. The senior side of Cliftonville was too good for the intermediate Crusaders team, with the Reds recording a 1-0 victory. The first game between the two sides as senior teams took place in the [[Ulster Cup]] on 17 September 1949, finishing in a 2-2 draw at Solitude. The first league match and Boxing Day derby took place on 26 December 1949, with Cliftonville emerging victorious with a 5-0 victory at Seaview. In 1979 at the height of [[The Troubles]], there were more than 1,900 police officers on duty for the Ulster Cup match on 21 September between Crusaders and Cliftonville at Seaview, more than has ever been recorded at a football match in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.community-relations.org.uk/about-us/news/item/686/memories-of-belfast-celtic-reawakened-as-ifa-tries-to-soothe-old-wounds|title=Memories of Belfast Celtic re-awakened as IFA tries to soothe old wounds|publisher=community-relations.org.uk|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://redblackredwhitegreenwhite.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/the-emergence-of-cliftonvilles-red-army-resistance-identity-and-football-in-1970s-north-belfast/|title=The emergence of Cliftonville's Red Army resistance: identity and football in 1970s North Belfast|publisher=redblackredwhitegreenwhite.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe sides first played each other in a cup final in 1978-79, with Cliftonville winning the [[County Antrim Shield]] in a penalty shoot-out, but with Glentoran and Linfield dominating Northern Irish football the sides did not reach a national cup final together until the 2008-09 season when they met in the final of the [[2008\u201309 Irish Cup]]. Crusaders won the match 1 &ndash; 0 in front of 7,500 fans at Windsor Park. It would be not long before the two met again in a cup final as in the 2012-13 season with the sides first and second in the league table they played each other in the final of the [[2012\u201313 Irish League Cup]] with Cliftonville emphatically winning 4 &ndash; 0 at Windsor Park. The following season they played again the League Cup Final but this time in a more cagey affair. Finishing 0 &ndash; 0 after extra time Cliftonville retained the cup with a 3 &ndash; 2 win on penalties.\n\nA fixture during the 2012-13 season came to national media attention after a game was cancelled due to a [[Belfast City Hall flag protests|Loyalist flag protest]]. Going into the fixture on 16 February 2013 Cliftonville led the Irish Premier League with a twelve-point lead, Crusaders in second had a game in hand and hoped a win over their rivals could see them falter. A small group of 20 flag protesters turned up half an hour before kick off and engaged in skirmishes with police. Around 2000 fans were in attendance but many supporters were unable to enter due to the protesters outside the turnstiles. The decision was made to cancel the game with condemnation of the protesters tactics and police's handling of the situation. Due to fixture congestion it was not rearranged until 22 April by which time Cliftonville had long won the title. Despite praise for both clubs during the incident further controversy emerged for the rearranged fixture when Crusaders on advice of the police only offered 200 tickets for away supporters (around 800 would be normal). Cliftonville fans issued a boycott of fixture (seven tickets were purchased, presumably to ticket stub collectors) leaving a completely empty away stand and total attendance of just 395.\n\nIn September 2018 the derby was chosen to be the first live [[NIFL Premiership]] match to be shown on BBC Two Northern Ireland, a part of a three year deal between [[BBC Sport|BBC Sport NI]], the [[Irish Football Association]] and [[Northern Ireland Football League]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/irish-fa-nifl|title=BBC Sport NI signs new three-year live football deal with the Irish FA and NIFL|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\nTraditionally Cliftonville's support was less polarised and they were seen as a cross community team in comparison to Crusaders, who had traditionally been regarded as a Unionist club. During the troubles the Cliftonville support came to be regarded as a [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] due to their location along the Cliftonville Road. With road blocks and cross community violence meaning that many away supporters no longer felt safe venturing to Solitude or Seaview. However, in recent years, with the streets safer than before, many supporters of both away teams choose to walk to their opponent's ground, given the close proximity of the grounds and the fact that both teams have largely local supports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-7.htm |title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland|publisher=cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the community differences the rivalry between supporters is fairly amicable and brings financial benefits to both clubs. A sell out league fixture can bring in an income of \u00a330,000. As is the tradition with many other derbies in the Irish League, each season a fixture is played on [[Boxing Day]], unless this day falls on a [[Sunday]].\n\n==Head-to-head==\nIn results between the two teams, Crusaders have 152 victories to Cliftonville's 85. Crusaders have won more games in the league, [[County Antrim Shield]], [[Ulster Cup]] and the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]], whereas Cliftonville have won more head-to heads in the [[Irish Cup]], [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup|League Cup]], [[Setanta Sports Cup]], [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] and Belfast Charity Cup. It should also be noted that Cliftonville's amateur status meant that they were rarely competitive until the early 1970s, losing most of their games and finishing bottom of the table on several occasions.\n\n===By competition===\n{{updated|3 March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.<ref>Morrison, Craig (1952). ''Go Cat Go!''

On 'Country Boy' I had my bass and drums playing a straight swing rhythm and wrote out that 'rumba' bass part for the saxes to play on top of the swing rhythm.

I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.<ref>Dave Bartholomew quoted by Palmer, Robert (1988: 27) \"The Cuban Connection\" ''Spin Magazine'' Nov.</ref>}}\n\nBartholomew referred to the Cuban [[son music|son]] by the misnomer ''rumba'', a common practice of that time. Fats Domino's \"[[Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)|Blue Monday]],\" produced by Bartholomew, is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in R&B. Bartholomew's 1949 tresillo-based \"Oh Cubanas\" is an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music.

New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as \"Carnival Day,\" (Bartholomew 1949) and \"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\" (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.\n\nRobert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \"fell under the spell of Perez Prado's [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records.\"<ref>Palmer, Robert (1979: 14).

Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.<ref>Morrison, Craig (1952). ''Go Cat Go!''
