It is related to the cognitive bias of [[illusory superiority]] and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability.

After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning, overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/ |title=What the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Is and Isn't |last=Yarkoni |first=Tal |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to estimate their class rank correctly after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/> The study \"Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability\" (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of [[illusory superiority]] to test subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ames |first=Daniel R. |last2=Kammrath |first2=Lara K. |date=September 2004 |title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf |journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |language=en |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=187\u2013209 |doi=10.1023/b:jonb.0000039649.20015.0e |issn=0191-5886 |citeseerx=10.1.1.413.8323}}</ref>\n\nThe study \"How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance\" (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues.

Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures,\n \nThe most common graphical convention is the Kruger-Dunning type graph typified by Figure 1 in the seminal paper.<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the Effect. Additional graphs used by other researchers who argued for the legitimacy of the Effect include (y-x) versus (x) cross plots (Figure 5 of Pazicni and Bauer, 2015<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pazicni|first=Samuel|last2=Bauer|first2=Christopher F.|date=2014|title=Characterizing illusions of competence in introductory chemistry students|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3RP00106G|journal=Chem.

These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the Effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the Effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the Effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions.\n\nTo expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence.

The paper confirms that minority groups are on average less privileged and score lower in the cognitive test scores and self-assessed confidence ratings on the instruments used in this research. They verified that women on average self-assessed more accurately than men, and did so across all ethnic groups that had sufficient representation in the researchers' database.\n\n==Cultural differences in self-perception==\nStudies of the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx |title=Why We overestimate Our Competence |last=DeAngelis |first=Tori |date=February 2003 |journal=Monitor on Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=60 |issn=1529-4978 |access-date=7 March 2011}}</ref> The study \"Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves\" (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heine |first=S.J. |last2=Lehman |first2=D.R. |last3=Ide |first3=E. |last4=Leung |first4=C. |last5=Kitayama |first5=S. |last6=Takata |first6=T. |last7=Matsumoto |first7=H. |date=October 2001 |title=Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=599\u2013615 |issn=0022-3514 |pmid=11642348 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.4.599}}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of the illusory superiority hypotheses established by the Dunning-Kruger effect can be found in the ''Upanishads,'' the ancient Sanskrit texts of spiritual teaching and ideas of Hinduism.

After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning, overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/ |title=What the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect Is and Isn't |last=Yarkoni |first=Tal |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform.

Researchers express the measures either as percentages or as percentile scores scaled from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 100. By convention, researchers express the differences between the two measures as self-assessed competence minus actual competence. In such a convention, negative numbers signify erring toward underconfidence, positive numbers signify erring toward overconfidence, and zero signifies perfectly accurate self-assessment.\n\nEhrlinger et al.<ref name=\"unskilledunaware\"></ref> summarized the major assertions of the Effect that first appeared in the 1999 seminal paper and continued to be supported by many studies after nine years of research: \"People are typically overly optimistic when evaluating the quality of their performance on social and intellectual tasks. In particular, poor performers grossly overestimate their performances\" (Ehrlinger et al. 2008, p. 98)''.''\n\nThe Effect asserts that most people are overconfident about their actual abilities, and that the least competent people are the most overconfident. Support for both assertions rests upon interpreting the patterns produced from graphing the paired measures,\n \nThe most common graphical convention is the Kruger-Dunning type graph typified by Figure 1 in the seminal paper.<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> That paper depicted college students' accuracy in self-assessing their competencies in humor, logical reasoning, and grammar. Researchers adopted that convention in subsequent papers on the Effect.

These researchers graphed their data in all the earlier papers' various conventions, and explained how the numerical reasoning used to argue for the Effect are similar in all. When graphed in these established conventions, the researchers' data also supported the Effect. Had the researchers ended their study at this point, their results would have added to the established consensus that validated the Effect. But their deeper analyses led them to conclude that the numerical procedures used repeatedly in all previous work were the likely sources of misleading conclusions.\n\nTo expose the sources of the misleading conclusions, the researchers employed their own real data set of paired measures from 1154 participants, and created a second simulated data set that employed random numbers to simulate random guessing by an equal number of simulated participants. The simulated data set contained only random noise, without any measures of human behavior.\n\nThe researchers<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" /><ref name=\"Nuhfer 2017\" /> then used the simulated data set and the graphical conventions of the behavioral scientists to produce patterns like those described as validating the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They traced the origin of the patterns, not to the dominant literature's claimed psychological disposition of humans, but instead to the nature of graphing data bounded by limits of 0 and 100 and to the process of ordering and grouping the paired measures to create the graphs. These patterns are mathematical artifacts that random noise devoid of any human influence can produce. They further showed that the graphs used to establish the Effect in three of the four case examples presented in the seminal paper are patterns characteristic of purely random noise. These patterns are numerical artifacts that behavioral scientists and educators seem to have interpreted as evidence for a human psychological disposition toward overconfidence.\n\nBut the graphic presented on the case study on humor in the seminal paper's Figure 1<ref name=\"Kruger\" /> and the Numeracy researchers' real data (Figure 4 of Nuhfer et al.<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />) were not the patterns of purely random noise. Although the data was noisy, that human-derived data exhibited some order that could not be attributed to random noise. The researchers attributed it to human influence and called it the \"self-assessment signal.\"<ref name=\"Nuhfer 2016\" />\n\nThe researchers went on to characterize the signal and worked to determine what human disposition it revealed. To do so, they employed different kinds of graphics that suppress or eliminate the noise responsible for most of the artifacts and distortions. The authors discovered that the different graphics refuted the assertions made for the Effect. Instead, they showed that most people are reasonably accurate in their self-assessments. About half of the 1154 participants in their studies accurately estimated their performance within \u00b110 percentage points (ppts). Two-thirds of these participants self-assessed their competency scores within \u00b115 ppts. Only about 6% of participants displayed wild overconfidence and were unable to accurately self-assess their abilities within 30 ppts. All groups overestimated and underestimated their actual ability with equal frequency. No marked tendency toward overconfidence, as predicted by the Effect, occurs, even in the most novice groups. In 2020, with an updated database of over 5000 participants, this relationship still held true. The revised mathematical interpretation of data confirmed that people typically have no pronounced tendency to overestimate their actual proficiency.\n\nGroups' mean self-assessments prove more than an order of magnitude more accurate than do individuals'. In randomly selected groups of 50 participants, 81% of groups' self-assessed mean scores were within 3 ppts of their actual mean competency score. The discovery that groups of people are accurate in their self-assessments opens an entirely new way to study groups of people with respect to paired measures of cognitive competence and affective self-assessed competence.

As you know more, you realize you know less for there is more to know. \n\n\n\n==Popular recognition==\nIn 2000, Kruger and Dunning were awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in recognition of the scientific work recorded in \"their modest report\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |title=Ig Nobel Past Winners |work=Improbable Research |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> \n\"The Dunning\u2013Kruger Song\"<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnH19KsVVc |title=\"The Dunning\u2013Kruger Song\", from ''The Incompetence Opera'' |date=15 January 2018 |website=YouTube.com |publisher=ImprobableResearch |access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> is part of ''The Incompetence Opera'',<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNGusIvpVxc |title=The Incompetence Opera |date=29 December 2017 |website=YouTube.com |publisher=ImprobableResearch |access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> a mini-opera that premiered at the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/ig/2017/ |title=The 27th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony & Lectures |access-date=18 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120422/https://www.improbable.com/ig/2017/ |archive-date=19 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mini-opera is billed as \"a musical encounter with the [[Peter principle]] and the Dunning\u2013Kruger Effect\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/2017/08/30/preview-the-incompetence-opera/ |title=Preview: \"The Incompetence Opera\" |publisher=Improbable Research |access-date=18 January 2018|date=30 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\nJournalists have often cited the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect in discussions of political incompetence.

The band consists of Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto (electric guitar, [[glockenspiel]]), Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Dahm Majuri Cipolla ([[drums]]), and Tamaki Kunishi (bass guitar, electric guitar, piano, glockenspiel).\n\nMono has released nine studio albums. The band spent their early years, from 1999 to 2003, touring Asia, Europe, and America continuously, and released two studio albums, ''Under the Pipal Tree'' (2001) and ''One Step More and You Die'' (2002) on the [[Tzadik Records]] and Music Mine Inc. record labels, respectively. From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to [[Temporary Residence Limited]], released two more studio albums, ''Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined'' (2004) and ''You Are There'' (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, ''Hymn to the Immortal Wind'' (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited. During the tour that followed they recorded a live album, ''Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra'' which was released in 2010. In October 2016 the band released their ninth studio album, titled ''Requiem for Hell''. Their most recent effort, 'Nowhere Now Here' was released on January 25, 2019 through Pelagic Records, and was produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago. It also contains Tamaki's first vocals for the band on the track 'Breathe'.\n\nThe band have cited a variety of [[experimental music|experimental]], [[avant-rock]] and [[classical music]] artists as inspirations but stated that their aim is to transcend genre, rejecting the [[post-rock]] label which has often been applied to them. Mono's sound is characterised by the lead and rhythm guitars of Goto and Yoda respectively, both of whom make extensive use of [[Reverberation|reverb]], [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] effects. The band's live performances are noted for their intensity, both in the playing and in the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:MonoCrocodileCafe10.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Electric guitarist \"Yoda\" in 2007]]\n\n===Formation and early years: 1999\u20132000===\nIn January 1999, Tokyo native electric guitarist Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto began composing music and spent the remainder of the year searching for other musicians with which to form an instrumental rock band; eventually recruiting long-time friend and fellow electric guitarist Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu on rhythm guitar.<ref name=Terrascope/> By December 1999, Tamaki Kunishi and Yasunori Takada had joined Mono on bass guitar and drums, respectively.

The band also made an appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, ''[[Under the Pipal Tree]]'' at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician [[John Zorn]], with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the ''Hey, You'' extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through [[New York City]] record label [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\n===''One Step More and You Die'': 2002\u20132003===\nAfter the release of ''Under the Pipal Tree'', the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, ''[[One Step More and You Die]]'' at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc.

The album, titled ''[[New York Soundtracks]]'', was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4.\n\nIn January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer [[Steve Albini]], recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The album, titled ''[[Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined]]'' was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year.

From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to [[Temporary Residence Limited]], released two more studio albums, ''Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined'' (2004) and ''You Are There'' (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, ''Hymn to the Immortal Wind'' (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited. During the tour that followed they recorded a live album, ''Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra'' which was released in 2010. In October 2016 the band released their ninth studio album, titled ''Requiem for Hell''. Their most recent effort, 'Nowhere Now Here' was released on January 25, 2019 through Pelagic Records, and was produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago.

The band also made an appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, ''[[Under the Pipal Tree]]'' at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician [[John Zorn]], with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the ''Hey, You'' extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through [[New York City]] record label [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\n===''One Step More and You Die'': 2002\u20132003===\nAfter the release of ''Under the Pipal Tree'', the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, ''[[One Step More and You Die]]'' at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc. The band spent most of 2003 touring in support of the album, returning to Japan, the United States, Sweden, and visiting Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom for the first time.\n\n===''Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined'': 2004===\nMono's next release was a collaboration with Japanese musician Aki Onda; whom the band met while touring New York in 2002. The band, Onda, and several notable members of the New York experimental music scene (including [[DJ Olive]], [[Jackie-O Motherfucker]], and [[Loren Connors]]) remixed ''One Step More and You Die''. The album, titled ''[[New York Soundtracks]]'', was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4.\n\nIn January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer [[Steve Albini]], recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The album, titled ''[[Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined]]'' was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year. After the album's release, the band embarked upon a year-long tour of America, Asia, and Europe.\n\n===''You Are There'': 2005\u20132007===\n[[File:Mono live 20050502.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Mono in Stockholm, Sweden, May 2005]]\nThe band also spent 2005 touring Asia, America, and Europe composing music, and eventually returning to Electrical Audio Engineering in February and September to record their fourth studio album with Steve Albini. The album, titled ''[[You Are There (Mono album)|You Are There]]'' was released in Japan in March 2006 on Human Highway, and on Temporary Residence Limited in the United States and Europe. Mono also collaborated with Japanese musician [[World's End Girlfriend]] in 2005, releasing a collaboration studio album in December of that year, on Human Highway, and with American band [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], releasing a split album with the band through Temporary Residence Limited in October 2005.\n\nMono spent 2006 and 2007 touring Asia, America and Europe in support of ''You Are There''. In October 2006, the band returned to Electrical Audio Engineering and recorded a four-track extended play, which was released in April 2007 as part of Temporary Residence Limited's [[Travels in Constants]] series, titled ''The Phoenix Tree''. In November 2006, the band released a two-track extended play titled ''[[Memorie dal Futuro]]'' through Vinyl Films, and also contributed a track to a Temporary Residence Limited compilation album, ''Thankful''. In September 2007, the band released their first compilation album, compiling material from all previous extended plays, split albums, and compilations, titled ''[[Gone (Mono album)|Gone: A Collection of EPs 2000\u20132007]]'', as well as the music documentary DVD, ''The Sky Remains the Same as Ever'', documenting the worldwide tours of 2006 and 2007 and the recording of ''The Phoenix Tree'' extended play.\n\n===''Hymn to the Immortal Wind'': 2008\u20132011===\n[[File:Mono in Prague 2010.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Mono in Prague, Czech republic, April 2010]]\nIn 2008, the band took a year-long break from touring, spending the time composing new music and playing a handful of shows throughout the year, including an appearance at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] in Somerset, England, curated by [[Explosions in the Sky]] in May. Mono returned to Electrical Audio Engineering in June and November 2008 to record their fifth studio album, ''[[Hymn to the Immortal Wind]]'', which was later released in March 2009, and followed by a year-long tour of America and Eurasia. The band played a ten-year anniversary show at the Society for Ethical Culture Hall in New York, United States on 8 May 2009, accompanied by the 24-piece Wordless Music Orchestra. The performance was recorded and later released as both a [[live album]] and a [[DVD]], named ''Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra'', through Temporary Residence Limited in Europe and America, and Human Highway in Asia.

''KeelyNet''.</ref> The phrase has also become established in popular culture as a reference to a [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]] trick, and has been referred to in various media accounts. In performing magic this effect is known as '''abnormal lift'''.<ref name=\"numen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lybrary.com/the-abnormal-lift-and-other-abnormalities-p-128439.html |title=The Abnormal Lift and other abnormalities |last1=Numen |first1=David |date=2010 |website=Lybrary.com |access-date=2016-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nOne participant lies flat on the floor, and then the others space themselves around him or her, each placing one or two fingertips underneath the participant's limbs. The person closest to the head commonly begins by saying, \"She's looking ill,\" which is repeated several times, and followed by, \"she's looking worse,\" which is also repeated several times. The general direction of the call-and-repeat describes how the prone person is looking worse and worse, followed by saying \"she is dying,\" and, finally, \"she is dead\".\n\nVariations of the spoken part of the game occur\u2014In a common, modern version, the person being lifted is told a story about his/her death and asked to imagine it happening to him/her. It serves the dual-purpose of \"freaking out\" the participants and convincing the participants that it will now be easier to lift this person than before.\n\nAll versions of the game end with the phrase \"light as a feather, stiff as a board\" chanted by the entire group, (save for the prone person, who pretends to be dead) as they attempt to lift their companion's body using only their fingertips. Some versions omit the story entirely and only the \"light as a feather...\" chant is used. Allegedly, after these repetitions, the person being lifted will seem lighter or even entirely weightless.\n\nAnother variation of the game takes place with one person seated in a chair. Four volunteers agree to stand around the sitter, two on the sitter's left side and the other two on his/her right. Each of the four places two fingers under each corner of the chair's seat and the four together will attempt to lift the chair and sitter, which generally fails. The volunteers will then perform some small ritual, usually involving rubbing their hands together or circling the chair in various direction (counter-clockwise, walking backwards, etc.) After this ritual, the volunteers hold their hands over the sitter's head to \"transfer\" energy into the sitter, which will presumably make him/her weightless. The lifters then retry lifting the sitter the same way as before. Also, it can be that the lifters lift the person sitting in the chair; doing the rest of the ritual as so but holding at the four main points of the body (Under the knees on each side and under the shoulders.)\n\n==Explanation of the trick==\n\nThe key to the trick is timing: each of the lifters must apply the lifting force at the same moment. When this is done, the weight of the subject is divided equally between each lifter, requiring each person to contribute only {{convert|12|-|20|kg|st|0}} of lift, to raise a {{convert|50|-|80|kg|st|0|adj=on}} person.<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/05/27/2257305.htm | title=Lift that finger |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-05-27}}</ref> This is about the same as each person lifting a heavy shopping bag.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reusable Bag Guidelines |url=http://www.wsps.ca/WSPS/media/Site/Resources/Downloads/Resuable_Bag_Guidelines.pdf?ext=.pdf |publisher=Health and Safety Ontario |accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIf the trick is performed without synchronising the lift, it will fail: as participants attempt to lift at slightly different times, they are instead performing a series of lifts by smaller groups, resulting in a much heavier weight per person. This fact may be used as a deliberate form of [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] from the person explaining the trick, first asking the group to \"go ahead, try to lift\" to show that it cannot be done, and then asking them to try again on the count of three, where it succeeds.<ref name=\"abc\"/>\n\nSome people who remember performing the trick as a child will have exaggerated their memory of the effect, recalling the performance as lifting the subject high into the air for some time, when in reality they would only have lifted them for a moment.<ref name=\"abc\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe oldest known account of levitation play comes from the [[diary of Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703), a British naval administrator. Pepys\u2019s account of levitation play comes from a conversation with a friend of his, Mr. Brisband, who claimed to have seen four little girls playing light as a feather, stiff as a board in Bordeaux, France. Pepys\u2019s account of Mr. Brisband\u2019s experience reads:\n{{quote|He saw four little girls, very young ones, all kneeling, each of them, upon one knee; and one begun the first line, whispering in the ear of the next, and the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and she to the first. Then the first begun the second line, and so round quite through, and putting each one finger only to a boy that lay flat upon his back on the ground, as if he was dead; at the end of the words, they did with their four fingers raise this boy high as they could reach, and he [Mr. Brisband] being there, and wondering at it, as also being afeared to see it, for they would have had him to have bore a part in saying the words, in the roome of one of the little girles that was so young that they could hardly make her learn to repeat the words, did, for feare there might be some sleight used in it by the boy, or that the boy might be light, call the cook of the \thouse, a very lusty fellow, as Sir G. Carteret's cook, who is very big, and they did raise him in just the same manner.''<ref>Pepys, Samuel, Le Gallienne, Richard ed., ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'' New York, The Modern Library, 2003.</ref>}}\n\nPepys also spoke of the chant that accompanied this performance.\n{{Verse translation\n|Voici un corps mort\nRaide comme un b\u00e2ton,\nFroid comme le marbre\nL\u00e9ger comme un esprit,\nL\u00e8ve-toi au nom de J\u00e9sus-Christ!\n|Here is a dead body\nStiff as a stick,\nCold as marble\nLight as a spirit,\nLift yourself, in the name of Jesus Christ!}}\n\nThe next recording of the game being played comes from ''The Magician\u2019s Own Book'' (1857). This account differs from that of Pepys, as it is a direct account of the game being played. Also, this account focuses on a different version of the game than the version played by the girls in Samuel Pepys\u2019 account.  In this account, the heaviest man at a party in Venice, Italy, sits in a chair, and is unable to be lifted by six other persons, initially. However, after coordinated hand-clapping and synchronized inhalations and exhalations, the man in the chair is able to be lifted on the forefingers of the six lifters.<ref>Arnold, George. (1862). The Magician\u2019s Own Handbook or The Whole Art of Conjuring. New York: Dick Fitzgerald.</ref>\n\nThe phenomenon has been observed into modern times, often being described as a form of [[spiritualism]] or [[seance]] and considered [[anathema]] by some religious groups.  It is widely considered a simple spooky [[party game]] along the lines of [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] and the telling of [[ghost story|ghost stories]].\n\nThe game appears in the 1996 film [[The Craft (film)|''The Craft'']], which follows the story of four young girls as they familiarize themselves with witchcraft and various arcane experiments\u2014one of which is light as a feather, stiff as a board. In the movie, the girls are seen performing the version of the game described in Samuel Pepys\u2019 diary, which involves one participant lying down, while the others kneel around her. The girls chant \u201cLight as a feather, stiff as a board,\u201d several times before lifting the prone participant into the air. In the movie, this scene involves special effects, which has the effect of the prone participant levitating above the hands of the lifters.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Light as a Feather (TV series)]] \n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/levitate In-depth explanation of levitation including tricks from Answers.com]\n*''Halloween is good clean fun'' October 30, 1998 Weekender Lexington Herald-Leader (KY) [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&s_site=kentucky&p_multi=LH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB741DF2B9E9BB7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM article for purchase link]\n*Pajama game: Despite dramatic changes in culture and technology, girls' sleepovers have remained basically the same for generations by MaryEllen Fillo Hartford Courant Aug. 30, 2005 [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/889302321.html?dids=889302321:889302321&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+30%2C+2005&author=MARYELLEN+FILLO%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=PAJAMA+GAMES+%3B+DESPITE+DRAMATIC+CHANGES+IN+CULTURE+AND+TECHNOLOGY%2C+GIRLS'+SLEEPOVERS+HAVE+REMAINED+BASICALLY+THE+SAME+FOR+GENERATIONS&pqatl=google article for purchase link]\n*[http://www.pepysdiary.com Samuel Pepys' diary highlights the experience during the London plague of 1665 as well as the Great Fire in 1666 ]\n*[https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/13613/CFR_2007-08_R3_prt.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=46 Levitation Revisited by Elizabeth Tucker explains the origins of the game and discusses some of its occult history.]\\\n*[http://magicpedia.ru/Portals/12/Books/MagiciansOwnBook-1862.pdf The Magician's Own Book contains an entry on page 341-42 which describes an account of the game being played at a Venetian party.]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWUKekJJaU, The Craft (1996) Light as a feather, Stiff as a board scene.]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqtUl44ZcBk Video example 1]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wznkUyXvb2s Video example 2]\n\n[[Category:Party games]]\n[[Category:Children's games]]\n[[Category:Magic tricks]]\n", "text_old": "'''Light as a feather, stiff as a bird''', sometimes known as '''pig in a blanket, stiff as a board''', is a game played by children at [[slumber party|slumber parties]].<ref name=\"played\">While not scientifically valid, and giving unproven explanations of the event, various pages are mentioned to demonstrate that the spell itself is known, and citation here does not imply that the sources are reliable to demonstrate anything beyond the fact that some people play this game.\n\n* [http://www.lauralee.com/partylv2.htm ''Party Levitation''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015155253/http://www.lauralee.com/partylv2.htm |date=2008-10-15 }} from Conversation for Exploration: A Talk Show hosted by Laura Lee \n* Description of the trick at [http://www.castleofspirits.com/levitation.html Castle of Spirits]\n* Jerry W.

''KeelyNet''.</ref> The phrase has also become established in popular culture as a reference to a [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]] trick, and has been referred to in various media accounts. In performing magic this effect is known as '''abnormal lift'''.<ref name=\"numen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lybrary.com/the-abnormal-lift-and-other-abnormalities-p-128439.html |title=The Abnormal Lift and other abnormalities |last1=Numen |first1=David |date=2010 |website=Lybrary.com |access-date=2016-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nOne participant lies flat on the floor, and then the others space themselves around him or her, each placing one or two fingertips underneath the participant's limbs. The person closest to the head commonly begins by saying, \"She's looking ill,\" which is repeated several times, and followed by, \"she's looking worse,\" which is also repeated several times. The general direction of the call-and-repeat describes how the prone person is looking worse and worse, followed by saying \"she is dying,\" and, finally, \"she is dead\".\n\nVariations of the spoken part of the game occur\u2014In a common, modern version, the person being lifted is told a story about his/her death and asked to imagine it happening to him/her. It serves the dual-purpose of \"freaking out\" the participants and convincing the participants that it will now be easier to lift this person than before.\n\nAll versions of the game end with the phrase \"light as a feather, stiff as a board\" chanted by the entire group, (save for the prone person, who pretends to be dead) as they attempt to lift their companion's body using only their fingertips. Some versions omit the story entirely and only the \"light as a feather...\" chant is used. Allegedly, after these repetitions, the person being lifted will seem lighter or even entirely weightless.\n\nAnother variation of the game takes place with one person seated in a chair. Four volunteers agree to stand around the sitter, two on the sitter's left side and the other two on his/her right. Each of the four places two fingers under each corner of the chair's seat and the four together will attempt to lift the chair and sitter, which generally fails. The volunteers will then perform some small ritual, usually involving rubbing their hands together or circling the chair in various direction (counter-clockwise, walking backwards, etc.) After this ritual, the volunteers hold their hands over the sitter's head to \"transfer\" energy into the sitter, which will presumably make him/her weightless. The lifters then retry lifting the sitter the same way as before. Also, it can be that the lifters lift the person sitting in the chair; doing the rest of the ritual as so but holding at the four main points of the body (Under the knees on each side and under the shoulders.)\n\n==Explanation of the trick==\n\nThe key to the trick is timing: each of the lifters must apply the lifting force at the same moment. When this is done, the weight of the subject is divided equally between each lifter, requiring each person to contribute only {{convert|12|-|20|kg|st|0}} of lift, to raise a {{convert|50|-|80|kg|st|0|adj=on}} person.<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/05/27/2257305.htm | title=Lift that finger |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-05-27}}</ref> This is about the same as each person lifting a heavy shopping bag.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reusable Bag Guidelines |url=http://www.wsps.ca/WSPS/media/Site/Resources/Downloads/Resuable_Bag_Guidelines.pdf?ext=.pdf |publisher=Health and Safety Ontario |accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIf the trick is performed without synchronising the lift, it will fail: as participants attempt to lift at slightly different times, they are instead performing a series of lifts by smaller groups, resulting in a much heavier weight per person. This fact may be used as a deliberate form of [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] from the person explaining the trick, first asking the group to \"go ahead, try to lift\" to show that it cannot be done, and then asking them to try again on the count of three, where it succeeds.<ref name=\"abc\"/>\n\nSome people who remember performing the trick as a child will have exaggerated their memory of the effect, recalling the performance as lifting the subject high into the air for some time, when in reality they would only have lifted them for a moment.<ref name=\"abc\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe oldest known account of levitation play comes from the [[diary of Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703), a British naval administrator. Pepys\u2019s account of levitation play comes from a conversation with a friend of his, Mr. Brisband, who claimed to have seen four little girls playing light as a feather, stiff as a board in Bordeaux, France.

She explained, \"It was something very raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think that is what happened with many.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dia-thinks-in-song|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330043752/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/10/dia-thinks-in-song.html|url-status=dead|title=Dia Thinks in Song|first=Cond\u00e9|last=Nast|archivedate=March 30, 2011|website=Teen Vogue}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005-2011: Meg & Dia ===\n\n''Main article: [[Meg & Dia]]''\n\nAlong with her sister Meg, Frampton was part of the five-piece alternative rock band Meg & Dia. The band released their debut album \"Our Home is Gone\" in 2005 (at the time the band was just a two-piece) and later released [[Something Real]] under Doghouse Records, which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band found success by promoting their music on [[MySpace]], leading them to become the official MySpace band on the [[Warped Tour 2006]]. \n\nMeg & Dia's profile in the rock scene continued to grow, leading to continued appearances at the Warped Tour, touring with bands such as [[Angels & Airwaves]] and a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. This deal yielded the pop-rock leaning [[Here, here and here]] , which charted at #103 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. dropped the band, reverting the group back to their indie status. Nonetheless, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album) | Cocoon]]'', which was received positively by fans and critics, but failed to perform well commercially, leading to Dia's manager, Mike Kaminsky, suggesting she audition for ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''\n\n\n===2011: ''The Voice''===\nDia Frampton was a contestant (and eventual runner-up) on the first season of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' on [[NBC]], introduced as a children's story author. Frampton stated that she had originally joined the show only with the intention of promoting ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album)|Cocoon]]'' and had not expected that she would make it that far in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dia starts The Voice tour|url=http://meganddia.com/?p=73|website=Meganddia.com|accessdate=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405193718/http://meganddia.com/?p=73|archive-date=April 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was selected to be on the team of coach [[Blake Shelton]], who stated, \"when I heard your voice, I started to smile.\" Frampton advanced through the show's quarter-finals and semi-finales after renditions of \"[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]\" and \"[[Losing My Religion]]\". Notably, the aforementioned singles were the highest charting iTunes digital songs by any contestant on ''The Voice'' during its respective voting eligibility period, with \"Inventing Shadows\" topping the charts at No.&nbsp;1. Following the season finale on June 29, 2011, \"Inventing Shadows\" debuted at No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with 137,000 downloads sold. As of July 7, 2011 Frampton's ''The Voice'' digital releases have sold 480,000 downloads.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trust|first=Gary |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/american-idol-vs-the-voice-who-won-the-1005268192.story |title='American Idol' Vs.

Dia graduated early by homeschooling her senior year, and at the same time attending public school. Dia then moved to Salt Lake City with her sister to further their music career. She cites [[Modest Mouse]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[The Avett Brothers]], [[Rocky Votolato]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Etta James]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[The Cranberries]], and [[Cursive]] as influences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Dia Frampton|url=http://www.musicgeek.org/wp/2005/06/11/an-interview-with-meg-and-dia|accessdate=January 20, 2008|date=June 11, 2005|publisher=MusicGeek.org}}</ref> During live performances, Frampton plays percussion instruments, such as the [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] and [[tambourine]], and occasionally a [[Privia|Casio Privia]] keyboard. She almost always performs without shoes on. She also does not like to eat anything within two hours of performing. Her father is an American of English and Dutch ancestry and her mother is Korean, originally from Seoul.\nFrampton often recorded a \"song diary,\" an impromptu recorded song, on her [[MySpace]] page. She explained, \"It was something very raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think that is what happened with many.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dia-thinks-in-song|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330043752/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/10/dia-thinks-in-song.html|url-status=dead|title=Dia Thinks in Song|first=Cond\u00e9|last=Nast|archivedate=March 30, 2011|website=Teen Vogue}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005-2011: Meg & Dia ===\n\n''Main article: [[Meg & Dia]]''\n\nAlong with her sister Meg, Frampton was part of the five-piece alternative rock band Meg & Dia. The band released their debut album \"Our Home is Gone\" in 2005 (at the time the band was just a two-piece) and later released [[Something Real]] under Doghouse Records, which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band found success by promoting their music on [[MySpace]], leading them to become the official MySpace band on the [[Warped Tour 2006]]. \n\nMeg & Dia's profile in the rock scene continued to grow, leading to continued appearances at the Warped Tour, touring with bands such as [[Angels & Airwaves]] and a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. This deal yielded the pop-rock leaning [[Here, here and here]] , which charted at #103 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. dropped the band, reverting the group back to their indie status. Nonetheless, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album) | Cocoon]]'', which was received positively by fans and critics, but failed to perform well commercially, leading to Dia's manager, Mike Kaminsky, suggesting she audition for ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''\n\n\n===2011: ''The Voice''===\nDia Frampton was a contestant (and eventual runner-up) on the first season of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' on [[NBC]], introduced as a children's story author. Frampton stated that she had originally joined the show only with the intention of promoting ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album)|Cocoon]]'' and had not expected that she would make it that far in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dia starts The Voice tour|url=http://meganddia.com/?p=73|website=Meganddia.com|accessdate=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405193718/http://meganddia.com/?p=73|archive-date=April 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was selected to be on the team of coach [[Blake Shelton]], who stated, \"when I heard your voice, I started to smile.\" Frampton advanced through the show's quarter-finals and semi-finales after renditions of \"[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]\" and \"[[Losing My Religion]]\". Notably, the aforementioned singles were the highest charting iTunes digital songs by any contestant on ''The Voice'' during its respective voting eligibility period, with \"Inventing Shadows\" topping the charts at No.&nbsp;1. Following the season finale on June 29, 2011, \"Inventing Shadows\" debuted at No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with 137,000 downloads sold.

Also in 2017, the group came to national limelight when it protested against the release of the movie ''[[Padmaavat]]''.<ref name=\"ToI_various_2018\"/>\n\n==''Jodhaa Akbar''==\nSRKS had protested when the film ''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]'' was released in 2008. According to Goldie Osuri, an academic with specialist interests in depictions of nationalism in the media, the public objection of the SRKS was related to a \"minor historical indeterminacy\" regarding whether the fictional central character was the wife or daughter-in-law of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]]. Osuri says that a wider analysis of media and blog sources shows that the real objection was to the depiction of marriage between the Muslim Akbar and a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] Rajput princess.<ref>{{cite book |title=Religious Freedom in India: Sovereignty and (anti) conversion |first=Goldie |last=Osuri |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-41566-557-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lz0Mg3xx9sC&pg=PA111}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Secular Interventions/Hinduized Sovereignty: (Anti) Conversion and Religious Pluralism in Jodhaa Akbar |first=Goldie |last=Osuri |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=81 |date=Spring 2012 |pages=70\u201399 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |jstor=10.5749/culturalcritique.81.2012.0070 }}</ref>\n\nThe SRKS did not receive an apology from the ''Jodhaa Akbar'' film-maker, [[Ashutosh Gowariker]], as they had demanded but some Rajasthani cinemas did refuse to show the production and there were some protests in other states also. The organisation then objected to the 2010 movie ''[[Veer (2010 film)|Veer]]'', which they claimed maligned their community. They vandalised some cinemas that showed the film, the acts being described by commentator Chitra Padmanabhan as: {{quote|Thereupon the Sena wrote a new chapter in bravery by indulging in acts of vandalism in theatres screening the movie.

Various objectors associated with SRKS said that the group would organise legal action and public protests to ban the series from being broadcast if discussions with the television company, [[Zee TV]], did not achieve their aim.

SR 20 crosses the [[Slate River (Virginia)|Slate River]] and passes through the community of [[Centenary, Virginia|Centenary]] on its way through northwestern [[Buckingham County, Virginia|Buckingham County]] to its crossing of the [[James River]].  On the north side of the bridge, the state highway enters the town of [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]], through which the highway passes as Valley Street.

At Garrett Street, SR 20 continues onto four-lane divided 9th Street, which crosses over [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Piedmont Subdivision]] into downtown Charlottesville.  The state highway passes to the east of the [[Downtown Mall]] and meets [[U.S._Route_250_in_Virginia#Charlottesville_business_route|US 250 Business]], which heads eastbound along Market Street and westbound along High Street, which are both two-way streets.  The business route joins SR 20 in a concurrency on High Street, which passes by the former [[Martha Jefferson Hospital]].  US 250 Business reaches its eastern terminus at [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|US 250]] (Long Street).

SR 20 enters Orange County and its name changes to Constitution Highway south of [[Barboursville, Virginia|Barboursville]], which contains the ruins of the [[Barboursville (James Barbour)|namesake estate]].  The state highway has a short concurrency with [[U.S. Route 33 in Virginia|US 33]] (Spotswood Trail) in which the highways pass under [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Washington District]].  SR 20 heads northeast and intersects [[Virginia State Route 231|SR 231]] (Blue Ridge Turnpike) north of [[Somerset, Virginia|Somerset]].

SR 20 passes the [[James Madison Museum]] before US 15 (Madison Street) joins the highway in a concurrency to pass under the Washington District rail line after the counties sole remaining tractor crossing.  The state highway turns east onto Berry Hill Road and passes under another Norfolk Southern rail line before receiving the other end of SR 20 Business (Byrd Street).  SR 20 becomes Constitution Highway again on leaving the town of Orange.  The state highway passes Orange County Airport and intersects [[U.S. Route 522 in Virginia|US 522]] (Zachary Taylor Highway) between [[Unionville, Virginia|Unionville]] and [[Rhoadesville, Virginia|Rhoadesville]].  SR 20 briefly passes through part of [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]] near the site of the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] before reaching its northern terminus at SR 3 (Germanna Highway) in the community of Locust Grove just west of the [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]] line.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\n== History ==\nSR 20 was first created in 1933 with the renumbering of SR 316 between US 15 in Dillwyn and SR 6 in Scottsville and a separate section to the north that replaced SR 702 between SR 231 in Somerset and SR 3 in Wilderness. In 1941, the southern section was extended north from SR 6 to US 250 in Charlottesville, and the northern section was extended south from SR 231 to US 33 in Barboursville. In 1950, the two sections of SR 20 were finally connected via a replacement of SR 613 between Charlottesville and Barboursville. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vahighways.com/route-log/va020.htm|title=VA 20|website=www.vahighways.com|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, the intersection of SR 20 and I-64 was changed.

The state highway runs {{convert|89.79|mi|km}} from [[U.S. Route 15 in Virginia|U.S. Route 15]] (US 15) in [[Dillwyn, Virginia|Dillwyn]] north to [[Virginia State Route 3|SR 3]] in [[Wilderness, Virginia|Wilderness]].  SR 20 is a C-shaped route that connects [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] with [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] (via US 15) in [[Southside Virginia]].  The state highway also links Charlottesville to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] (via SR 3) by way of [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]], within which SR 20 is the main east&ndash;west highway and intersects US 15 again in the [[county seat]] of [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]].\n\nSR 20 is a [[Virginia Byway]] from [[Scottsville, VA|Scottsville]] to [[Orange, VA|Orange]].\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2016-07-21 18 27 16 View north along Virginia State Route 20 (Berry Hill Road) between U.S. Route 15 (Caroline Street) and Warren Street in Orange, Orange County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|View north along SR 20 past US 15 in Orange]]\nSR 20 begins at an intersection with US 15 (James Madison Highway) just west of the town of Dillwyn.  The state highway heads north as the two-lane Constitution Route, which passes through the hamlet of [[Allenslevel, Virginia|Allenslevel]], the site of [[Buckingham Correctional Center]].  SR 20 crosses the [[Slate River (Virginia)|Slate River]] and passes through the community of [[Centenary, Virginia|Centenary]] on its way through northwestern [[Buckingham County, Virginia|Buckingham County]] to its crossing of the [[James River]].  On the north side of the bridge, the state highway enters the town of [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]], through which the highway passes as Valley Street.  SR 20 meets [[Virginia State Route 6|SR 6]] (Main Street) in the center of town.  The two highways run together to the north end of town where SR 6 splits west as Irish Road.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\nSR 20 continues through southern Albemarle County as Scottsville Road.  The state highway heads through [[Glendower, Virginia|Glendower]], where the highway passes close to the historical [[President of the United States|presidential]] retreat [[Pine Knot (cabin)|Pine Knot]] and [[Christ Church Glendower]].  North of [[Keene, Virginia|Keene]], SR 20 crosses the [[Hardware River]] as the watercourse and the highway passes through a gap between Green Mountain and Carters Mountain, which are part of the [[Southwest Mountains]].  The state highway follows the west side of the latter mountain to the community of [[Mill Creek, Albemarle County, Virginia|Mill Creek]], where the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with [[Virginia State Route 53|SR 53]] (Thomas Jefferson Parkway).  SR 53 provides access to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]]'s respective estates of [[Monticello]] and [[Ash Lawn&ndash;Highland]].  SR 20 passes the entrance to [[Piedmont Virginia Community College]] just south of its [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange with [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate 64]].<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\nSR 20 becomes Monticello Avenue on crossing Moores Creek into the city of Charlottesville.  The street reduces to two lanes and curves west to Avon Street, onto which the state highway turns north.  At Garrett Street, SR 20 continues onto four-lane divided 9th Street, which crosses over [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Piedmont Subdivision]] into downtown Charlottesville.  The state highway passes to the east of the [[Downtown Mall]] and meets [[U.S._Route_250_in_Virginia#Charlottesville_business_route|US 250 Business]], which heads eastbound along Market Street and westbound along High Street, which are both two-way streets.  The business route joins SR 20 in a concurrency on High Street, which passes by [[Martha Jefferson Hospital]].  US 250 Business reaches its eastern terminus at [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|US 250]] (Long Street).  SR 20 turns east onto US 250 to cross the Free Bridge over the [[Rivanna River]] to leave the city limits.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\nSR 20 heads north from the Charlottesville vicinity along Stony Point Road, which parallels the west flank of the Southwest Mountains.  The state highway passes the communities of [[Key West, Virginia|Key West]], [[Eastham, Virginia|Eastham]], [[Stony Point, Virginia|Stony Point]], and [[Rosena, Virginia|Rosena]].  SR 20 enters Orange County and its name changes to Constitution Highway south of [[Barboursville, Virginia|Barboursville]], which contains the ruins of the [[Barboursville (James Barbour)|namesake estate]].  The state highway has a short concurrency with [[U.S. Route 33 in Virginia|US 33]] (Spotswood Trail) in which the highways pass under [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Washington District]].  SR 20 heads northeast and intersects [[Virginia State Route 231|SR 231]] (Blue Ridge Turnpike) north of [[Somerset, Virginia|Somerset]].  The state highway continues east and closely parallels the railroad through [[Montpelier Station, Virginia|Montpelier Station]], which is named for [[James Madison]]'s estate [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]] on the south side of the tracks.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\nSR 20 continues east to the town of Orange, where the highway enters town as Main Street.  At the [[Holladay House]], the state highway turns south onto Caroline Street while Main Street continues east SR 20 Business.  SR 20 passes the [[James Madison Museum]] before US 15 (Madison Street) joins the highway in a concurrency to pass under the Washington District rail line after the counties sole remaining tractor crossing.  The state highway turns east onto Berry Hill Road and passes under another Norfolk Southern rail line before receiving the other end of SR 20 Business (Byrd Street).  SR 20 becomes Constitution Highway again on leaving the town of Orange.  The state highway passes Orange County Airport and intersects [[U.S. Route 522 in Virginia|US 522]] (Zachary Taylor Highway) between [[Unionville, Virginia|Unionville]] and [[Rhoadesville, Virginia|Rhoadesville]].  SR 20 briefly passes through part of [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]] near the site of the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] before reaching its northern terminus at SR 3 (Germanna Highway) in the community of Locust Grove just west of the [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]] line.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 20\"/>\n\n== History ==\nSR 20 was first created in 1933 with the renumbering of SR 316 between US 15 in Dillwyn and SR 6 in Scottsville and a separate section to the north that replaced SR 702 between SR 231 in Somerset and SR 3 in Wilderness. In 1941, the southern section was extended north from SR 6 to US 250 in Charlottesville, and the northern section was extended south from SR 231 to US 33 in Barboursville. In 1950, the two sections of SR 20 were finally connected via a replacement of SR 613 between Charlottesville and Barboursville. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vahighways.com/route-log/va020.htm|title=VA 20|website=www.vahighways.com|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, the intersection of SR 20 and I-64 was changed. Travelers exiting I-64 west and turning left onto SR 20 south now have a dedicated lane to turn into. As a result, travelers only have to cross SR 20 north and then merge with SR 20 south. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbs19news.com/content/news/Traffic-pattern-change-coming-to-I-64Route-20-interchange-508783091.html|title=Traffic pattern change coming to I-64/Route 20 interchange|website=CBS19 News|language=english|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n== Future ==\nTwo new roundabouts have been approved to be implemented along SR 20.
