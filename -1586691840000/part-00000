Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J.

The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A. Nadybal, Bhutan Stamp Agency Problems Revealed, in: Postal Himal no.72, 4th Quarter 1992, pp 64-65: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1992_004.pdf</ref> After the death in 1972 of the 3rd [[Druk Gyalpo]], His Majesty [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], a good friend of Todd, one of the changes which took place was the cancellation of the contract of the Bhutan Stamp Agency end March 1974.<ref>Nildo Harper, Bhutan - A (continued) Brief Postal History, in: Postal Himal no.52, 4th Quarter 1987, p44: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1987_004.pdf</ref><ref>Brian Kuehl,'The Demise of the Bhutan Stamp Agency', in: 'The Kaleidoscope' (Bimonthly Publication of the Bhutan Philatelic Society) vol.1, no.2, July\u2013August 1976, pp 2-4</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Bhutanese stamps have tended to be more conventional with just the occasional unusual format. Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15.

These stamps are listed in the Michel catalogue under nos. 2517 - 2528.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of late 2010 / early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue.

This left the front side free for writing of a message.\n\nThe next year P&T issued a simple, single postal card with a purple 10 Chhetrum imprinted stamp showing crossed dorjis or [[vajra]]s. At the same time a reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined single postcards. Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".  Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line.<ref>the size of the card is 100 x 180 mm with strip, and has the modern picture postcard size of 100 x 150 mm without</ref> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998. The folding letters, similar to an aerogramme, were mostly distributed free of charge by Bhutan Post to make the writing of letters popular.<ref>Karl-Heinz Michel, 'Bhutan Free Mail Campaign 1998 & 1999', in: Postal Himal no.126, 2nd Quarter 2006, p11-12 http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2006_002.pdf</ref> One carries the campaign slogans ''Let us produce a good relationship between parents and children through the exchange of letters'' in Dzongkha on the front and on the reverse in English ''Donate Blood,Save Lives''. The imprinted stamp is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the April 1998 WHO stamp set issued on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter.

The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years.

However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>.

With the opening up of Bhutan in the early 1960s, a formal postal system was introduced. The American entrepreneur Burt Todd assisted in establishing a postage stamp program in the country<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/history.htm |title=Bhutan Stamps - History |publisher=Bhutanpostagestamps.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> and Bhutan became known for the unusual designs and materials of its stamps which were chosen by Todd specifically to attract attention. With the assistance of the Indian postal advisor Dr. K. Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J. Raymond, 'Bhutan New Postal Services Poses Several Questions', reprinted in ''The Great Wall'' (Quarterly of the China Stamp Collectors Club of Australasia), vol IV, no.1, October 1959</ref> Although disputed, the Finnish philatelist Iiro Kakko opines that the majority of the known covers sent to Kalimpong appear not to be genuine letters routed through the postal system, but especially produced for the philatelic market.<ref>Tshering Tashi, 'When revenue stamps served for postage', Kuensel Online 20 March 2011 (former link 'http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=18776'), also reprinted in Phila Mirror 15 April 2011 http://philamirror.info/2011/04/15/when-revenue-stamps-served-for-postage/ ; see also: Iiro Kakko, 'Bhutan - Dzong Dak Covers', in: Postal Himal no.85, 1st Quarter 1996, p. 17: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1996_002.pdf</ref>\n\n===Start of the modern era===\nWith the start of development programs in Bhutan and the end of its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of mail items, now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A.

Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The sheet carries the text ''Coronation and Centenary Celebrations 2008''. The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15. Each stamp is framed, which provides a blank space for the printing of a personalized picture, drawing or logo.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of late 2010 / early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue. The sheetlet bears the text ''Celebrating Royal Wedding 2011'', while there is a picture of the newlywed couple as well.

All postage labels will indicate date and time, the sending post office, place of addressee, weight of envelope, and costs of postage. EMS and registered letters also indicate name of receiver, EMS or registration tracking number and the registration fee. Registered letters and domestic EMS letters using a postal label, will also have a separate registration or EMS label with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding bar-code, while for international EMS covers this is part of the main label. Registered letters using ordinary postage stamps, will have an analog registration number, often written by hand on the envelope.\n\n==Revenue, legal and non-judicial stamps==\n[[File:Bhutanese revenue stamps used on legal document.jpg|thumb|left|Bhutanese revenue stamps of the 1950s used on a legal document]]\nBhutan has issued [[revenue stamp]]s in 1954, 1966/1967 and 1996.

These stamps were also made valid for postage as of 1 January 1955 (see above \u2018Dzong Dak system and the use of fiscals as postage\u2019) until the introduction of the postage stamps in 1962, although they appear to have been postally used until at least 1964.<ref>Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, section Bhutan 'Postal-Fiscal Stamps'</ref> The set has been reprinted in the 1950s on paper that varies from the first printing in 1954, while also the colour ink may differ. A surcharged issue on the blue 1 trangka revenue stamp had been reportedly released in 1961 or 1962, diagonally surcharged respectively with \"10NP\" and \"25NP\" (NP standing for New Paisa, so using the Indian currency), but identified as fakes originating from Kathmandu, Nepal.<ref>Gobi Times , June 1970, pp 5-6, \u2018Further information on fiscal overprints\u2019</ref>\nOnly in 1966 was a new set of two revenue stamps  ready for release, now in Bhutanese currency, of 10 Chetrum (red colour) and 25 Chetrum (jade colour).

This left the front side free for writing of a message.\n\nThe next year P&T issued a simple, single postal card with a purple 10 Chhetrum imprinted stamp showing crossed dorjis or [[vajra]]s. At the same time a reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined single postcards. Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".

The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998.

Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter.

The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years. Recently they resurfaced on Facebook as ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors''.<ref>see the Facebook page of ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors'' at https://www.facebook.com/groups/129173790434880/</ref> The [[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]] provides also a haven for collectors of Bhutanese stamps and Bhutan philately receives regular attention in their publication ''Postal Himal''.<ref>the NTPSC website is hosted by Rainer's Stamp Corner http://fuchs-online.com/ntpsc , while digital copies of their publication Postal Himal can be found on the website of the Digital Himalaya Project co-located at the Cambridge and Yale universities http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/postalhimal</ref>\n\n==Catalogues and publications==\nA specific stamp catalogue for Bhutan does not exist at the moment. However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>. The postal museum narrates the story of the evolution of communication, transportation and postal services in Bhutan's history. The story is told through the collection of various anecdotes, artifacts and the rich assortment of stamps Bhutan has produced over the years<ref> Bhutan Postal Museum website http://www.bhutanpostalmuseum.bt/ </ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people on stamps of Bhutan]]\n*[[Bhutan Postal Corporation]]\n*[[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Bhutan through postage stamps''.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Type Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4.

The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications.

He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own [[parachute]] has been shot up. He manages to contact June, an [[Americans|American]] [[Radio|radio operator]] based in England and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.\n\nPeter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the [[Other World]], misses him in the [[Visibility|thick fog]] over the [[English Channel]]. The airman wakes up on a beach near June's base. At first, he assumes he is in the [[afterlife]] but, when a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.\n\nPeter meets June [[cycling]] back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French [[aristocrat]] [[guillotined]] in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a [[Defense (legal)|defence counsel]] from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.\n\nPeter's visions are diagnosed by June's fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury\u2014chronic adhesive [[arachnoiditis]] from a slight [[concussion]] two years earlier\u2014and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves' death allows him to act as Peter's [[counsel]].\n\nReeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife's claim on him. The matter comes to a head\u2014in parallel with Peter's brain surgery\u2014before a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an [[amphitheatre]] to reveal that it is as large as a [[spiral galaxy]]. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.\n\nReeves and Farlan both cite examples from [[British history|British]] and [[world history]] to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter's open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, \"...&nbsp;nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.\"\n\nThe jury rules in Peter's favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it \"very generous\", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[David Niven]] as Squadron Leader Peter David Carter\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as June\n* [[Roger Livesey]] as Dr. Frank Reeves\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as an Angel\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as an English Pilot\n* [[Bonar Colleano]] as an American Pilot\n* [[Joan Maude]] as Chief Recorder\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Conductor 71\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe{{refn|\"Trubshawe\" was a name often given to minor characters in Niven's films at his insistence, as a back-handed tribute to his old army friend [[Michael Trubshawe]].<ref name=warman/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n* [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]] as the Vicar\n* Bob Roberts as Dr. Gaertler\n* Edwin Max as Dr. Mc Ewan\n* Betty Potter as Mrs. Tucker, Reeves' housekeeper\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Abraham Farlan\n* [[Abraham Sofaer]] as the Judge {{col-end}}\n[[File:Matter Life Death Hunter Niven.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim Hunter and David Niven in the film.]]\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n\nGoring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach [[Peter Ustinov]] to play the part.<ref>Powell 1986, p. 489</ref>\n\nPowell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, [[Betty Field]], who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s screen test for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.

When Pressburger countered with the hit film ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]'', their response was to point out that it succeeded because the very fact that Death was on holiday meant that there would be no death in the film.<ref>Powell 1986, pp. 486-87.</ref><ref name=\"SFGate\">Stein, Ruthe.

However, despite being asked several times within the film, no accepted answer to how Peter could have survived the fall is given.\n\nThere are two scenes set within \"the other world\" in which Peter is not present (Trubshawe's arrival and just before the start of the trial) which seem to imply the existence of the other world. A minor point regarding a borrowed book (which forms a third \"other world\" experience while Peter is still unconscious following his operation) also seems to hint at the possibility of its existence; however, these could all be explained simply by Peter's mind filling in blanks during times he is unconscious.\n\n===The other world===\nThe producers took pains never to refer to \"the other world\" as [[Heaven]], as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the \"other world\" and asking: \"It's heaven, isn't it?\" This is followed by the \"other world\" female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be \"...heaven to be a clerk\". An introductory title screen \u2013 repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman<ref name=\"warman\"/> \u2013 contains an explicit statement, however: \"This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war\", but goes on to say \"Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental\".\n\nThe architecture of the other world is noticeably [[modernist]].

There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the [[D-Day]] invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as \"overpaid, oversexed and over here\" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry \u2013 against the British \u2013 is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War.

Written, produced and directed by [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]], the film stars [[David Niven]], [[Roger Livesey]], [[Raymond Massey]], [[Kim Hunter]] and [[Marius Goring]].\n\nThe film was originally released in the United States under the title '''''Stairway to Heaven''''', which derived from the film's most prominent [[special effects|special effect]]: a broad [[escalator]] linking Earth to the [[afterlife]]. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in [[Three-strip Technicolor]], but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as \"Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in [[Technicolor]]\". This reversed the effect in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.{{refn|As Powell pointed out, we know that this world is in colour.<ref name=alim/>|group=\"nb\"}} Photographic dissolves between \"Technicolor Dye-Monochrome\" (the Other World) and [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|Three-Strip Technicolor]] (Earth) are used several times during the film.\n\nIn 1999, ''A Matter of Life and Death'' placed 20th on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Best 100 British films]].<ref>{{cite web| title= Best 100 British films - full list |date=23 September 1999 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/455170.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate= 27 February 2015}}</ref> In 2004, a poll by the magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' of 25 film critics named ''A Matter of Life and Death'' the second greatest British film ever made, behind ''[[Get Carter]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3711460.stm \"Get Carter tops British film poll.\"] [[BBC|BBC News]], 3 October 2004.

He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own [[parachute]] has been shot up. He manages to contact June, an [[Americans|American]] [[Radio|radio operator]] based in England and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.\n\nPeter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the [[Other World]], misses him in the [[Visibility|thick fog]] over the [[English Channel]]. The airman wakes up on a beach near June's base. At first, he assumes he is in the [[afterlife]] but, when a [[de Havilland Mosquito]] flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.\n\nPeter meets June [[cycling]] back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French [[aristocrat]] [[guillotined]] in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a [[Defense (legal)|defence counsel]] from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.\n\nPeter's visions are diagnosed by June's fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury\u2014chronic adhesive [[arachnoiditis]] from a slight [[concussion]] two years earlier\u2014and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves' death allows him to act as Peter's [[counsel]].\n\nReeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife's claim on him. The matter comes to a head\u2014in parallel with Peter's brain surgery\u2014before a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an [[amphitheatre]] to reveal that it is as large as a [[spiral galaxy]]. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.\n\nReeves and Farlan both cite examples from [[British history|British]] and [[world history]] to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter's open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, \"...&nbsp;nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.\"\n\nThe jury rules in Peter's favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it \"very generous\", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[David Niven]] as Squadron Leader Peter David Carter\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as June\n* [[Roger Livesey]] as Dr. Frank Reeves\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as an Angel\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as an English Pilot\n* [[Bonar Colleano]] as an American Pilot\n* [[Joan Maude]] as Chief Recorder\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Conductor 71\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe{{refn|\"Trubshawe\" was a name often given to minor characters in Niven's films at his insistence, as a back-handed tribute to his old army friend [[Michael Trubshawe]].<ref name=warman/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n* [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]] as the Vicar\n* Bob Roberts as Dr. Gaertler\n* Edwin Max as Dr. Mc Ewan\n* Betty Potter as Mrs. Tucker, Reeves' housekeeper\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Abraham Farlan\n* [[Abraham Sofaer]] as the Judge {{col-end}}\n[[File:Matter Life Death Hunter Niven.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim Hunter and David Niven in the film.]]\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n\nGoring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach [[Peter Ustinov]] to play the part.<ref>Powell 1986, p. 489</ref>\n\nPowell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, [[Betty Field]], who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for [[Ingrid Bergman]]'s screen test for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.  Hunter had stage experience and had been under contract to [[David O. Selznick]] for two years.

However, despite being asked several times within the film, no accepted answer to how Peter could have survived the fall is given.\n\nThere are two scenes set within \"the other world\" in which Peter is not present (Trubshawe's arrival and just before the start of the trial) which seem to imply the existence of the other world. A minor point regarding a borrowed book (which forms a third \"other world\" experience while Peter is still unconscious following his operation) also seems to hint at the possibility of its existence; however, these could all be explained simply by Peter's mind filling in blanks during times he is unconscious.\n\n===The other world===\nThe producers took pains never to refer to \"the other world\" as [[Heaven]], as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the \"other world\" and asking: \"It's heaven, isn't it?\" This is followed by the \"other world\" female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be \"...heaven to be a clerk\". An introductory title screen \u2013 repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman<ref name=\"warman\"/> \u2013 contains an explicit statement, however: \"This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war\", but goes on to say \"Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental\".\n\nThe architecture of the other world is noticeably [[modernist]].

There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the [[D-Day]] invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as \"overpaid, oversexed and over here\" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry \u2013 against the British \u2013 is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War.

After the Turkish invasion in Cyprus (1974), Famagusta's residents were forced to leave the city and spread to other Cyprus cities. Women's team recruited for a short term in Larnaca, but re-established strong foundations in 1987, in Nicosia, by Anorthosis' people who moved there after the war. The first members of the team were schoolgirls, but gradually the team grew and became competitive in the first division of women volleyball. Their first championship came in 2002, and in 2004 Anorthosis managed to win both the championship and National Cup.

After the Turkish invasion in Cyprus (1974), Famagusta's residents were forced to leave the city and spread to other Cyprus cities. Women's team recruited for a short term in Larnaca, but re-established strong foundations in 1987, in Nicosia, by Anorthosis' people who moved there after the war. The first members of the team were schoolgirls, but gradually the team grew and became competitive in the first division of women volleyball. Their first championship came in 2002, and in 2004 Anorthosis managed to win both the championship and National Cup. Since then, Anorthosis has been one of the top four teams of the Cyprus championship, and has won seven championships, seven National Cups and nine Super Cups. \u03a4hat makes Anorthosis the most successful Cypriot women's team of the last 20 years.\n\n==Current volleyball squad==\n{| bgcolor=\"white\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"white\" \n| align=center|'''Number'''\n| align=center|'''Player'''\n| align=center|'''Nationality'''\n| align=center|'''Position'''\n| align=center|'''Birth Year'''\n| align=center|'''Height (m)'''\n|- align=left\n|1\n|[[Marina Christodoulou]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Outside Hitter\n|2002\n|1.77\n|- align=\"left\"\n|2\n|[[Taylor Milton]]\n||{{flagicon|US}} [[United States]]\n|Opposite\n|1992\n|1.81\n|- align=\"left\"\n|3\n|[[Andrea Charalambous]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Middle Blocker\n|1988\n|1.83\n|- align=\"left\"\n|4\n|[[Christiana David]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Libero\n|1993\n|1.66\n|- align=\"left\"\n|5\n|[[Courtney Felinski]]\n||{{flagicon|US}} [[United States]]\n|Outside Hitter\n|1992\n|1.86\n|- align=\"left\"\n|6\n|[[Tatiana Antoniou]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Libero\n|2004\n|1.65\n|- align=\"left\"\n|7\n|[[Kalia Vassiliou]] (C)\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Setter\n|1987\n|1.80\n|- align=\"left\"\n|8\n|[[Pelagia Tzakidou]]\n|{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Middle Blocker\n|2003\n|1.78\n|- align=\"left\"\n|9\n|[[Mary Hadjipetrou]]\n|{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Setter\n|2003\n|1.75\n|- align=\"left\"\n|10\n|[[Juliana Caetano]]\n||{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Brazil]]\n|Outside Hitter\n|1987\n|1.85\n|- align=\"left\"\n|11\n|[[Vaso Riala]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Middle Blocker\n|2000\n|1.88\n|- align=\"left\"\n|12\n|[[Georgia Stavrinidou]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Middle Blocker\n|2001\n|1.88\n|- align=\"left\"\n|13\n|[[Natalia Bratuhhina]]\n||{{flagicon|Estonia}} [[Estonia]]\n|Outside Hitter\n|1987\n|1.78\n|- align=\"left\"\n|16\n|[[Constantina Demetriou]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Setter\n|2005\n|1.70\n|- align=\"left\"\n|17\n|[[Lilia Angelide]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Middle Blocker\n|1987\n|1.75\n|- align=\"left\"\n|18\n|[[Afroditi David]]\n||{{flagicon|Cyprus}} [[Cyprus]]\n|Libero\n|1987\n|1.65\n|- align=\"left\"\n|}\nCoach: Alexandar Boskovic {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] <br>\nPresident of Department:  Adamos Montanios\n\n==Titles==\n*'''Cyprus Championships: 7'''\n**2002, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2018, 2019\n*'''Cyprus Cups: 7'''\n**2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2019\n*'''Cyprus Super Cups: 9'''\n**1993, 1994, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2012, 2017, 2018, 2019\n*'''Championship Runner-up: 12'''\n**1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2014\n*'''Cup Finalist: 7'''\n**1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2017, 2018\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.anorthosisvolley.com Volleyball Official website]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/ANORTHOSIS.WOMEN.VOLLEYBALL.TEAM/ Women Team Facebook Page]\n*[http://www.anorthosisfc.com.cy/ Official website of Anorthosis Famagusta]\n\n==Volleball Court, Nicosia==\nAnorthosis Sports Hall [https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1423697,33.3808963,235m/data=!3m1!1e3 (location on google maps)]\n\n{{Anorthosis FC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anorthosis Famagusta Volley (women)}}\n[[Category:Women's volleyball teams in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Sport in Famagusta]]\n\n\n{{Volleyball-team-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Graham87", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorthosis_Famagusta_Volley_(women)"}
