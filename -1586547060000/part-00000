The character was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[John Romita Sr.]] and [[Ross Andru]]. The Punisher made his first appearance in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 129|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129]] ([[cover-date]]d February [[1974 in comics|1974]]).\n\nThe character is an [[Italian-American]]<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDvMRvvfIK4C&pg=PA6399&dq=%22frank+castle%22+italian&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid0cTOxe3SAhWH_iwKHWnoBqoQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=frank%20castle&f=false |title=Library of Congress Subject Headings|page=6399|publisher=[[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\"Martone 334\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHJ1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA334&dq=Punisher+sicilian+saga&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjorNrewO3SAhVHQpoKHS6TCsgQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=Punisher%20sicilian&f=false |title= Italian Americans: The History and Culture of a People|first= Eric|last=Martone |isbn=978-1610699945 |date=December 12, 2016 |page=334 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[vigilante]] who employs [[murder]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[Assault (tort)|threats of violence]], and [[torture]] in his campaign against crime.

By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically-troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: ''The Punisher'', ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'', ''[[The Punisher War Zone|The Punisher: War Zone]]'', and ''The Punisher Armory''.\n\nDespite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series as ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers. In feature films, [[Dolph Lundgren]] portrayed the Punisher in ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]'', as did [[Thomas Jane]] in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and [[Ray Stevenson]] in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. [[Jon Bernthal]] portrayed the character in the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and the spin-off ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{For|complete list of Punisher titles|List of The Punisher titles}}\n\n===First appearance===\nThe Punisher was conceived of by [[Gerry Conway]], then-writer of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', inspired by ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', a popular book series created by author [[Don Pendleton]], in which a [[Vietnam veteran]], [[Mack Bolan]], becomes a serial killer of criminals after the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-related deaths of his family. Conway described the inspiration in an interview from 1987: \"I was fascinated by the Don Pendleton Executioner character, which was fairly popular at the time, and I wanted to do something that was inspired by that, although not to my mind a copy of it. And while I was doing the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] storyline, the opportunity came for a character who would be used by the Jackal to make [[Spider-Man]]'s life miserable. The Punisher seemed to fit.\"<ref>Comics Interview #75 (1985)</ref>\n\nConway also helped design the character's distinctive costume. As Conway recalled in 2002, \"In the '70s, when I was writing comics at [[DC Comics|DC]] and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters\u2014heroes and villains\u2014which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/14conway.html |title=All the Stars There Are in (Super-hero) Heaven!

He is portrayed as a bloodthirsty vigilante who has no qualms about killing gangsters, something that most superheroes of the time refrain from doing. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] describes him as \"the most newsworthy thing to happen to [[New York City|New York]] since [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]\".

At the time he was living with Duffy Vohland, an employee in Marvel's production department. Vohland encouraged Grant to pitch story ideas to Marvel, and arranged an interview with then-editor-in-chief [[Marv Wolfman]], with whom Grant would become good friends. Grant sat at Vohland's typewriter for a day and wrote three ideas: One involved the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]] and one was the Punisher, since those were characters he liked that as far as Grant knew, no other Marvel writer was working with at the time. Unbeknownst to Grant, the Punisher, as it turned out, was the lead in a black and white magazine being written by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], making the character unavailable for Grant's use. A couple of years later Grant began writing for Marvel after another friend, [[Roger Stern]], became a Marvel editor there and asked Grant to write something for him. In 1979, Marvel began considering publishing miniseries, which Grant had been lobbying for some time. Grant began pushing for a ''Punisher'' miniseries, but this was met with disinterest from editorial, as the character was not thought of as one that readers would care about. The following year, Grant collaborated on ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #94 with artist [[Mike Zeck]]. In 1984, Zeck illustrated Marvel's first ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, which raised his profile in the Marvel offices, where editors were thinking in terms of talent \"stables\" that worked exclusively for each editor. A new editor, [[Carl Potts]], was looking for projects, so Grant and Zeck pitched a ''Punisher'' miniseries to him, and Potts accepted it, over much objection from Marvel management, who told him that he bore full responsibility for it.<ref name=\"CBR3.6.15\">Cronin, Brian (March 6, 2015).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n[[File:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992); art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]\nAn ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 \u2013 July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series\u2014''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (80 issues, November 1988 \u2013 July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 \u2013 July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, November 1989 \u2013 September 1990) and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing \"His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!\" (as stated on the cover of issue #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''.\n\nDuring this era, the Punisher was assisted by his then-partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. Serving as a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] type figure, he would supply the Punisher with high-tech vehicles and equipment such as armored combat \"battle vans\" specially built and customized.\n\nOver the next decade, the Punisher would be shown fighting virtually every known, criminal organization, including the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia|Russian Bratva]], the [[Yakuza|Japanese Yakuza]], the [[Colombia|Columbian]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartels]], the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the [[Triad (underground societies)|Chinese Triads]], [[Yardie|Jamaican Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], [[outlaw motorcycle club|biker gangs]], [[Gang|street gangs]], [[arms trafficking|gunrunning]] [[militia]]s, [[Robbery|muggers]], [[Murder|killer]]s, [[rape|rapists]], [[Psychopathy|psychopaths]], violent [[racism|racists]], [[Sadomasochism|sadists]], [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], and [[Political corruption|corrupt city officials]] . He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as [[drug trafficking]], [[Gun running|weapons smuggling]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]].\n\nDue to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely-scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' vol. 2, #15\u201319 (January\u2013May 1989)</ref> a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods. Villains such as the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #28\u201329 (Mid December 1989 \u2013 January 1990)</ref> The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] would be used to provide more of a challenge for the character. In addition, heroes such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Daredevil, [[Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #5\u20136 (September\u2013October 1990)</ref> the [[Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #6\u20137 (June\u2013July 1989)</ref> [[Nick Fury]], and [[Moon Knight]]<ref name=\":0\">''The Punisher Annual'' vol. 2 #2 (1989)</ref> \u2013 and, on at least two occasions, the preadolescent team [[Power Pack]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #14, ''Power Pack'' vol. 1 #46</ref> \u2013 would appear. Often the stories would use the appearance of those heroes to provide commentary on the difference between the Punisher and those more colourful characters. During Don Daley's run on ''The Punisher'' title, his version of justice was described by the editor as \"an [[eye for an eye]]\".<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #98 (January 1995): Letters page</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1995, Marvel canceled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a re-launch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series ''[[Punisher (1995 series)|Punisher]]'', under the new [[Marvel Edge]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher willingly joined and became the boss of an organized crime family, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. The series ran for 18 issues, from November 1995 to April 1997. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue Marvel Knights miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (November 1998 \u2013 February 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s. This version of the character also appeared in a 4-issue mini-series co-starring Wolverine.\n\n===Revivals===\nA 12-issue miniseries by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], again titled ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 \u2013 March 2001), under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, August 2001 \u2013 February 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, [[MAX (comics)|MAX]]. Returning the character to his lone vigilante roots, those series combined crime-focused stories with black humor. The look of the Punisher was modified further removing the white gloves and pairing his traditional skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, black combat boots and a black trench coat. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories before ''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2.\n\n===MAX imprint===\n{{Main|The Punisher (2004 series)|PunisherMAX}}\n[[File:PunMax44.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Promotional art for ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #44 (March 2007), by [[Tim Bradstreet]].]]\nContinuing his run on the character, [[Garth Ennis]] used the freedom of the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] to write more realistic and hard-edged stories than had previously been seen.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 | title=Max'ing Out the Future: Axel Alonso Talks Marvel Max | work=[[Newsarama]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519203358/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 | archivedate=May 19, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comixtreme.com/forums/showthread.php?t=33068 | title=''Punisher War Journal'' #4 Review | work=ComiXtreme}}</ref> Ennis has stated that he would \"like to see less superheroes\";<ref>{{Cite book | last=Ennis | first=Garth | chapter=Frankly, I'd Like to See Less Superheroes | title=Inside the World of Comic Books | editor-first=Jeffery | editor-last=Klaehn | location=Montreal | publisher=Black Rose Books | year=2007 | pages=206\u2013210}}</ref> this desire is reflected in the gritty, realistic tone and the anti-heroic portrayals of both the title character and [[Nick Fury]], who made two guest appearances in the series. ''Punisher'' also made it explicit that Castle's timeline was fixed, while Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. Promotional art for the cover of ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #44 (March 2007), gave his birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After the departure of Ennis as writer, the series was renamed ''Punisher: Frank Castle'' with issue #66.\n\nThe imprint depicts the Punisher being active for almost 30 years, with ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #19 (June 2005) specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people. Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the [[United States]] and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandals|corporate fraud]] to [[sexual slavery]] and the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]. Many characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Soviet]] [[KGB]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and [[Special Air Service|SAS]], as well as various militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]], including the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nThe miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'' by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]] further examines Castle's roots, tracing them back to his third tour of the Vietnam War, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals from his childhood.\n\nThe ''MAX'' version of the Punisher ends with the character's death. After killing the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Castle dies from his own wounds in issue #21 of ''[[PunisherMAX]]''. He is buried in issue #22 as his death sparks a public uprising and killing of the city's criminals.\n\n===''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2)===\nIn November 2006, a new ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and penciled by [[Ariel Olivetti]], was released. The first three issues of the book are set during Marvel's \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-super-powered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main ''Civil War'' series (issues #5\u20137). Wearing both his traditional costume and his Marvel Knights/MAX attire, and a new costume designed to look like his costume and Captain America's combined, the series pitted the character against a series of super-powered foes while also being involved in crossover events such as \"[[World War Hulk]]\" and \"[[Secret Invasion]]\".\n\n===''The Punisher'' and ''Punisher: Frank Castle''===\n[[File:Frankencastle.PNG|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Punisher'' vol. 7, #11 (January 2010); art by Dave Wilkins]]\nMarvel relaunched ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' in 2009 as simply ''[[Punisher (2009 series)|Punisher]]'', with a thematic link tied to the events of the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline and, following the departure of writer [[Garth Ennis]], retitled the Marvel MAX series (formerly ''Punisher MAX'') as ''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' and, more recently, as ''Punisher: Frank Castle''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13057 | title=''Punisher: Frank Castle'' #75 (December 2009) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> or ''Frank Castle: The Punisher''<ref>''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' #74 (November 2009): Page 44</ref> (depending on the source); launching a new series called ''PunisherMAX'' by [[Jason Aaron]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13374 | title=''PunisherMAX'' #1 (January 2010) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> As part of his work on the character, [[Rick Remender]] wrote the one-shot title ''Dark Reign: The List \u2013 Punisher'', which, as part of the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, shows the character dismembered and decapitated by [[Daken]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List \u2013 The Punisher'' #1 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nFollowing this, the main ''Punisher'' series was renamed ''FrankenCastle'' and featured a Castle who is resurrected by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] and the Legion of Monsters as a patchwork, [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein]]-like creature.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #11 (January 2010)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091118-Punisher-Remender.html | title=Putting the Punisher Back Together With Rick Remender | work=Newsarama | date=November 18, 2009}}</ref> He joins up with the Legion of Monsters to help protect the monsters of Monster Metropolis from the Hunter of Monster Special Force.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #12 (February 2010)</ref> At the conclusion of the series, the character was transformed back into a normal human when he acquired the mystical Bloodstone, with its healing abilities restoring his humanity, although he subsequently chose to discard it despite its healing powers because he recognized that reliance on the stone would result in its side-effects eventually affecting his judgment so that he would lose the ability to recognize innocents.{{issue|date=November 2018}}\n\n===''Punisher: In the Blood''===\nIn 2010, a Punisher series was released titled ''[[Punisher: In the Blood]]''.

When he returned, the society he was essentially defending betrayed him and murdered his wife and children in front of him. The conflict matters less than the fact that he gave his service, and this was the reward. In that broad brush vague Marvel Universe sense there's always 'the war' whatever it was.

While a Marine, he also received training from the [[United States Army Airborne School|Airborne School]] and [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] as well as cross-training with the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, since beginning his work as the Punisher, Castle has used his military discipline and training techniques to update and expand his skills in areas that aid in his mission (disguise, acting, use of non-military weapons, etc.). From this training, the Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry skills, but in special operations, which includes the use and maintenance of specialized firearms and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, capture, and military intelligence. Also, he is trained in various forms of camouflage and stealth.

The Punisher has a [[Kevlar]] uniform which protects him from most gunfire, though he can still suffer concussive injury or penetration from sufficient or repeated impacts.

During the \"Civil War\", he was aided by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]] for a short time. Various police officers and detectives have assisted the Punisher, most notably [[Lynn Michaels]] and [[Martin Soap|Lt. Martin Soap]].

By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically-troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: ''The Punisher'', ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'', ''[[The Punisher War Zone|The Punisher: War Zone]]'', and ''The Punisher Armory''.\n\nDespite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series as ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers. In feature films, [[Dolph Lundgren]] portrayed the Punisher in ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]'', as did [[Thomas Jane]] in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and [[Ray Stevenson]] in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. [[Jon Bernthal]] portrayed the character in the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and the spin-off ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{For|complete list of Punisher titles|List of The Punisher titles}}\n\n===First appearance===\nThe Punisher was conceived of by [[Gerry Conway]], then-writer of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', inspired by ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', a popular book series created by author [[Don Pendleton]], in which a [[Vietnam veteran]], [[Mack Bolan]], becomes a serial killer of criminals after the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-related deaths of his family. Conway described the inspiration in an interview from 1987: \"I was fascinated by the Don Pendleton Executioner character, which was fairly popular at the time, and I wanted to do something that was inspired by that, although not to my mind a copy of it. And while I was doing the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] storyline, the opportunity came for a character who would be used by the Jackal to make [[Spider-Man]]'s life miserable. The Punisher seemed to fit.\"<ref>Comics Interview #75 (1985)</ref>\n\nConway also helped design the character's distinctive costume. As Conway recalled in 2002, \"In the '70s, when I was writing comics at [[DC Comics|DC]] and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters\u2014heroes and villains\u2014which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind.

At the time he was living with Duffy Vohland, an employee in Marvel's production department. Vohland encouraged Grant to pitch story ideas to Marvel, and arranged an interview with then-editor-in-chief [[Marv Wolfman]], with whom Grant would become good friends. Grant sat at Vohland's typewriter for a day and wrote three ideas: One involved the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]] and one was the Punisher, since those were characters he liked that as far as Grant knew, no other Marvel writer was working with at the time. Unbeknownst to Grant, the Punisher, as it turned out, was the lead in a black and white magazine being written by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], making the character unavailable for Grant's use. A couple of years later Grant began writing for Marvel after another friend, [[Roger Stern]], became a Marvel editor there and asked Grant to write something for him. In 1979, Marvel began considering publishing miniseries, which Grant had been lobbying for some time. Grant began pushing for a ''Punisher'' miniseries, but this was met with disinterest from editorial, as the character was not thought of as one that readers would care about. The following year, Grant collaborated on ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #94 with artist [[Mike Zeck]]. In 1984, Zeck illustrated Marvel's first ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, which raised his profile in the Marvel offices, where editors were thinking in terms of talent \"stables\" that worked exclusively for each editor. A new editor, [[Carl Potts]], was looking for projects, so Grant and Zeck pitched a ''Punisher'' miniseries to him, and Potts accepted it, over much objection from Marvel management, who told him that he bore full responsibility for it.<ref name=\"CBR3.6.15\">Cronin, Brian (March 6, 2015).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n[[File:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992); art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]\nAn ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 \u2013 July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series\u2014''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (80 issues, November 1988 \u2013 July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 \u2013 July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, November 1989 \u2013 September 1990) and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing \"His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!\" (as stated on the cover of issue #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''.\n\nDuring this era, the Punisher was assisted by his then-partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. Serving as a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] type figure, he would supply the Punisher with high-tech vehicles and equipment such as armored combat \"battle vans\" specially built and customized.\n\nOver the next decade, the Punisher would be shown fighting virtually every known, criminal organization, including the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia|Russian Bratva]], the [[Yakuza|Japanese Yakuza]], the [[Colombia|Columbian]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartels]], the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the [[Triad (underground societies)|Chinese Triads]], [[Yardie|Jamaican Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], [[outlaw motorcycle club|biker gangs]], [[Gang|street gangs]], [[arms trafficking|gunrunning]] [[militia]]s, [[Robbery|muggers]], [[Murder|killer]]s, [[rape|rapists]], [[Psychopathy|psychopaths]], violent [[racism|racists]], [[Sadomasochism|sadists]], [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], and [[Political corruption|corrupt city officials]] . He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as [[drug trafficking]], [[Gun running|weapons smuggling]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]].\n\nDue to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely-scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' vol. 2, #15\u201319 (January\u2013May 1989)</ref> a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods.

Often the stories would use the appearance of those heroes to provide commentary on the difference between the Punisher and those more colourful characters. During Don Daley's run on ''The Punisher'' title, his version of justice was described by the editor as \"an [[eye for an eye]]\".<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #98 (January 1995): Letters page</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1995, Marvel canceled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a re-launch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series ''[[Punisher (1995 series)|Punisher]]'', under the new [[Marvel Edge]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher willingly joined and became the boss of an organized crime family, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. The series ran for 18 issues, from November 1995 to April 1997. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue Marvel Knights miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (November 1998 \u2013 February 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s. This version of the character also appeared in a 4-issue mini-series co-starring Wolverine.\n\n===Revivals===\nA 12-issue miniseries by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], again titled ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 \u2013 March 2001), under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, August 2001 \u2013 February 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, [[MAX (comics)|MAX]]. Returning the character to his lone vigilante roots, those series combined crime-focused stories with black humor. The look of the Punisher was modified further removing the white gloves and pairing his traditional skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, black combat boots and a black trench coat.

''Punisher'' also made it explicit that Castle's timeline was fixed, while Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. Promotional art for the cover of ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #44 (March 2007), gave his birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After the departure of Ennis as writer, the series was renamed ''Punisher: Frank Castle'' with issue #66.\n\nThe imprint depicts the Punisher being active for almost 30 years, with ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #19 (June 2005) specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people. Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the [[United States]] and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandals|corporate fraud]] to [[sexual slavery]] and the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]. Many characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Soviet]] [[KGB]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and [[Special Air Service|SAS]], as well as various militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]], including the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nThe miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'' by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]] further examines Castle's roots, tracing them back to his third tour of the Vietnam War, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals from his childhood.\n\nThe ''MAX'' version of the Punisher ends with the character's death. After killing the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Castle dies from his own wounds in issue #21 of ''[[PunisherMAX]]''. He is buried in issue #22 as his death sparks a public uprising and killing of the city's criminals.\n\n===''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2)===\nIn November 2006, a new ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and penciled by [[Ariel Olivetti]], was released. The first three issues of the book are set during Marvel's \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-super-powered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main ''Civil War'' series (issues #5\u20137). Wearing both his traditional costume and his Marvel Knights/MAX attire, and a new costume designed to look like his costume and Captain America's combined, the series pitted the character against a series of super-powered foes while also being involved in crossover events such as \"[[World War Hulk]]\" and \"[[Secret Invasion]]\".\n\n===''The Punisher'' and ''Punisher: Frank Castle''===\n[[File:Frankencastle.PNG|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Punisher'' vol. 7, #11 (January 2010); art by Dave Wilkins]]\nMarvel relaunched ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' in 2009 as simply ''[[Punisher (2009 series)|Punisher]]'', with a thematic link tied to the events of the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline and, following the departure of writer [[Garth Ennis]], retitled the Marvel MAX series (formerly ''Punisher MAX'') as ''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' and, more recently, as ''Punisher: Frank Castle''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13057 | title=''Punisher: Frank Castle'' #75 (December 2009) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> or ''Frank Castle: The Punisher''<ref>''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' #74 (November 2009): Page 44</ref> (depending on the source); launching a new series called ''PunisherMAX'' by [[Jason Aaron]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13374 | title=''PunisherMAX'' #1 (January 2010) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> As part of his work on the character, [[Rick Remender]] wrote the one-shot title ''Dark Reign: The List \u2013 Punisher'', which, as part of the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, shows the character dismembered and decapitated by [[Daken]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List \u2013 The Punisher'' #1 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nFollowing this, the main ''Punisher'' series was renamed ''FrankenCastle'' and featured a Castle who is resurrected by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] and the Legion of Monsters as a patchwork, [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein]]-like creature.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #11 (January 2010)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091118-Punisher-Remender.html | title=Putting the Punisher Back Together With Rick Remender | work=Newsarama | date=November 18, 2009}}</ref> He joins up with the Legion of Monsters to help protect the monsters of Monster Metropolis from the Hunter of Monster Special Force.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #12 (February 2010)</ref> At the conclusion of the series, the character was transformed back into a normal human when he acquired the mystical Bloodstone, with its healing abilities restoring his humanity, although he subsequently chose to discard it despite its healing powers because he recognized that reliance on the stone would result in its side-effects eventually affecting his judgment so that he would lose the ability to recognize innocents.{{issue|date=November 2018}}\n\n===''Punisher: In the Blood''===\nIn 2010, a Punisher series was released titled ''[[Punisher: In the Blood]]''.

When he returned, the society he was essentially defending betrayed him and murdered his wife and children in front of him. The conflict matters less than the fact that he gave his service, and this was the reward. In that broad brush vague Marvel Universe sense there's always 'the war' whatever it was.

In addition, since beginning his work as the Punisher, Castle has used his military discipline and training techniques to update and expand his skills in areas that aid in his mission (disguise, acting, use of non-military weapons, etc.). From this training, the Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry skills, but in special operations, which includes the use and maintenance of specialized firearms and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, capture, and military intelligence.

The Punisher has a [[Kevlar]] uniform which protects him from most gunfire, though he can still suffer concussive injury or penetration from sufficient or repeated impacts.

The sad truth is that Frank Castle can't survive without killing, and his new job fulfills him in ways his family never could.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/27|title=Punisher|work=IGN}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe is ranked #39 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'''s Top 200 Comic Book Characters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[IGN]] later listed the ''Punisher'' series #15 in their 25 Best Comic Runs of the Decade, praising [[Garth Ennis]]'s ten-year timeline of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/19/25-best-comic-runs-of-the-decade?page=3|title=25 Best Comic Runs of the Decade|work=IGN}}</ref> Writer and director [[Joss Whedon]] has been critical of the character, referring to the Punisher as \"a coward\" in an issue of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Joss Whedon|title = On Heroes Killing:|magazine = Wizard|location = United States|publisher = Wizard Entertainment|date = March 2006|language = English|issue = 173|page = 54|quote = They really shouldn't kill.

[[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] assisted Castle by building and supplying weapons and technology and providing friendship. During the \"Civil War\", he was aided by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]] for a short time. Various police officers and detectives have assisted the Punisher, most notably [[Lynn Michaels]] and [[Martin Soap|Lt. Martin Soap]]. Lynn Michaels was a police officer who teamed up with Castle to take down a serial rapist and later quit the force to become a vigilante. Martin Soap was secretly allied with the Punisher and gave him information on his targets from the police database.\n\n==In politics and popular culture==\n[[Image:Charlottesville Punisher emblem.jpg|thumb|A variation of the Punisher's skull emblem that was used by protesters at the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]].<ref name=\"Deconstructing\"/>]]\nThe Punisher's skull emblem has become popular within the [[Blue Lives Matter]] movement, with many companies producing [[decal]]s, stickers, and T-shirts featuring the Punisher emblem colored with the [[thin blue line]], or atop an American flag.

It was designed and implemented by the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), the ruling body of the sport. This system of scoring is used in all international competitions sanctioned by the ISU, including the [[Olympic Games]]. The ISU Judging System replaced the previous [[6.0 system]] in 2004. This new system was created in response to the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]], in an attempt to make the scoring system more objective and less vulnerable to abuse.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scoring System Approved|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/sports/sports-briefing.html?ref=internationalskatingunion|access-date=25 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Previous judging system==\n{{main|6.0 system}}\nFigure skating was formerly judged on a 6.0 scale. This scale is sometimes called \"the old scale\", or \"old system\". Skaters were judged on \"technical merit\" (in the free skate), \"required elements\" (in the short program), and \"presentation\" (in both programs). The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0 and were used to determine a preference ranking, or \"ordinal\", separately for each judge; the judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program.\n<!-- \"Lowest scoring\" is correct in the following sentence; 1.0 factored placements beat 2.0 factored placements, and 1.0 is lower than 2.0. -->The highest scoring individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.\n\n==Scandal and response==\n{{main|2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal}}\nIn 2004, after the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal|judging controversy]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the ISU adopted the New Judging System (NJS), or Code of Points, which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Technical panel===\nUnder the ISU Judging System, the base value of each element performed by the skater is identified by the Technical Panel.  The purpose of this panel is to identify all of the elements performed by the skater in real time as they happen.  The panel is also responsible for: any \"technical errors\" to jumps; identifying falls of the skater; and any \"levels of difficulty\" performed in Spins and Steps.\n\nThe Technical Panel is composed of the following five people:\n# The Technical Specialist ('''TS''') who verbally calls the elements as they happen in real time.\n# The Assistant Technical Specialist ('''ATS''') whose primary purpose is to take written notes on all of the elements performed and to contribute to any decisions on technical calls during the \"review of elements\".\n# The Technical Controller ('''TC''') who is there to supervise the panel, and break ties on technical decisions during the \"review of elements\" when the TS and ATS do not agree. The TC is also responsible for \"rule vetting\" the program, and is able to throw out any elements that break the rules for that level and specific program.\n# The Data Operator ('''DO''') who inputs the codes of the elements and levels of difficulty into the computer system.  The DO also flags elements called \"for review\". In the U.S. the DO also replays the video clips of the elements during the review process. The DO is available to assist the TC in the process of \"rule vetting\", in the event that the TC is unsure or makes a mistake.\n# The Video Replay Operator ('''VRO''') who marks clips of elements for review. This person replays the clips in place of the DO in international competitions,<ref>{{Cite book|title=US Figure Skating Rulebook 2017-2018|last=|first=|publisher=US Figure Skating|year=|isbn=|location=Colorado Springs, CO USA|pages=107\u2013108}}</ref> however in the U.S. this person is not involved in the review process.\n\n===Judging panel===\nThe judging panel's primary purpose is to grade the quality of each individual technical element performed by the skater, known as the Grade of Execution (GOE), and the five Program Component Scores (PCS) for each segment of the competition. The five component scores replaced the \"presentation mark\" in the old 6.0 system. At most international events and other large National Championships (such as the U.S. Championships) there are nine judges, but at smaller competitions the panel might consist of between four and seven judges. An odd number of judges was needed to break ties in the old 6.0 system, but this is no longer necessary with averaging marks in the ISU Judging System.\n\n==== Grade of Execution (GOE)====\nThe evaluation of the Grade of Execution (GOE) for each technical element has clear guidelines from the ISU; it ranges from a \"base value\" of 0, to as high as +5 and as low as \u20135. In order to award a positive GOE, a judge needs to identify a certain number of \"positive bullets\" with almost no reductions. One positive bullet is needed for a GOE of +1, two bullets for a +2, three for a +3, four for a +4, and five or more for a GOE of +5. In the case of a negative GOE, a judge must be able to support their evaluation with reference to the published list of reductions. As the skater performs each element, the judges evaluate all phases of the element, possibly weighing both positive and negative aspects of the element in order to determine a final GOE.<ref name=\"ISU2168\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/communications/17142-isu-communication-2168/file|title=ISU Communication No. 2168 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution, season 2018/19 (REVISED)|date=25 June 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|access-date=9 July 2018}}</ref> Prior to the [[2018\u201319 figure skating season|2018&ndash;2019 season]], which started on 1 July 2018, the GOE scoring system ranged from \u20133 to +3, with a base value of 0.<ref name=\"ISU2089\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/ISU%202089-sptc-comm-goe-sov-2017-18.pdf|title=ISU Communication No. 2089 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution, season 2017/18|date=11 May 2017|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]}}</ref> The changes were implemented to allow more accurate scoring factors to be awarded in a sport that is becoming increasingly technical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/communications/17037-isu-communication-2156/file|title=Agenda of the 57th Ordinary Congress, Seville \u2013 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|date=30 April 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nTo aid the process of evaluating only the ''quality'' of an element, while ignoring the ''difficulty'' of the element, the judges are simply shown the element codes on their screens; they do not see the levels of difficulty awarded by the Technical Panel. The judges must be able to support every mark that they have awarded in case they are questioned by the referee after the event.\n\n==== Program Component Scores (PCS)====\n\nThe five program component scores are Skating skills, Transitions, Performance, Composition, and Interpretation. Each mark has individual characteristics that are evaluated; they are scored from 0.25 to 10.00 in quarter-point increments. The scale from zero to ten is an absolute scale, so for example if 6.00 is considered \"above average\" then each judge\u2019s understanding of a 6.00 should remain the same throughout an event and their judging careers.\n\n* ''Skating skills'': This mark assesses the skater's command of the blade over the ice, including the ability to skate with power and ease, forwards and backwards, clockwise and counter-clockwise. How acute is the skater's blade to the ice? How clean and clear are the curves over the ice (known as edge quality)? Skating skills are considered to be excellent if the skater moves quickly and easily, and flows over the ice with soft knees and ankles; but they are judged to be poor if the skating is scratchy and noisy, with the skater pushing from their toes rather than from the sides of the blades.\n* ''Transitions'': This mark evaluates all of the \"in between\" skating when technical elements are not being performed, i.e. whether the skater is merely skating in circles, or incorporating different turns and steps, perhaps also using their arms. A program with good transitions manages to \"thread\" all the elements together, making the skater's program seem effortless. Poor transitions are sometimes non-existent or merely places between the technical elements with a precise \"stopping\" point where the skater begins to prepare for the next element.\n* ''Performance'': This is where the scores start to become slightly more abstract and largely based on the judges' individual opinions. Is the skater physically, emotionally, and mentally involved in their program? Does the skater project to the entire audience and arena? Does the skater have presence on the ice with good carriage? Do they project their own personality while skating?\n* ''Composition'': This mark is concerned with the pattern and spacing over the ice, i.e. how the technical elements are placed throughout the ice surface. Does the skater always skate in the same part of the ice or are they making use of the entire area given to them? Is there a purpose to the way the program is constructed? Maybe their performance is designed to convey an abstract idea like rain or snow; or it might be about a particular story, e.g. when performing to a movie soundtrack or ballet. Does the movement in the program match the phrasing of the music? Perhaps there is meant to be a traditional musical \"call and answer\" or something more abstract.\n* ''Interpretation'': This score reflects how well the judges feel that the skater is performing with their \"soul\" (whereas the Composition score is more about the choreography). Does the skater move in time to the music, or are all the movements just off by a beat or two? Does the skater reflect every little trill and ding with a corresponding skating move?<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/ISU%20program-component-chart_sandp-and-id_08-16.pdf|title=Program Components \u2013 Singles & Pairs, Ice Dance|date=28 August 2016|website=www.usfigureskating.org}}</ref>\n\n==== Computation of scores ====\n\nThe judging panel consists of up to nine judges and one referee. The Technical Panel sends the element codes to the judges' computers for marking. For each element, all of the judges award a mark for Grade of Execution (GOE) that is an integer between \u20135 and +5. The GOE mark is then translated into a value using the Scale of Value (SOV) table which is published regularly by ISU Communications.<ref name=\"isu_rules\">{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/figure-skating-rules/regulations-rules-fs/file|title=ISU Special Regulations & Technical Rules, Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance, 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> The GOE values from the nine judges are averaged using the \"[[trimmed mean]]\" procedure, where the highest and lowest values are discarded and an average is calculated from the remaining seven values.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" /> This average value (which may be positive or negative) is finally added to the base value to produce the judging panel's overall score for the element.\n\nJudges also mark the Program Components, which are: Skating Skills; Transitions/Linking Footwork; Performance and Execution; Composition and Choreography; and Interpretation and Timing. These Components are marked on a scale of 0.25\u201310 with 0.25 increments and averaged using the same \"trimmed mean\" procedure that was used for averaging the GOE marks. Judges also have the power to input majority deductions such as Music Violations and Costume/Prop Violations. The Referee inputs other deductions such as Time Violations, Interruption in Excess and Costume Failures.\n\n===Technical elements===\nThe number and type of technical elements included in a skating program depend on the event and on the level of competition. At the senior international level, the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]] for both singles and pair skaters must contain seven technical elements. The [[Free skating|free program]] must contain twelve elements for singles and eleven elements for pairs.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\nDetails of the seven elements required of singles skaters in their short program are given in ISU rule 611; the skater must attempt two solo [[Figure skating jumps|jumps]], one combination jump, three [[Figure skating spins|spins]] (including one combination spin and one flying spin), and one [[step sequence]]. The seven elements required of pair skaters in their short program are detailed in ISU rule 620; the pair must attempt two lifts, one side-by-side jump, one throw jump, one spin combination, one [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]], and one step sequence.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\nThe twelve elements required of singles skaters in their free program are detailed in ISU rule 612; the skater must perform seven jumps, three spins (including one combination spin and one flying spin), one step sequence, and one choreographic sequence (formerly the \"choreographic step sequence\" for Men and the \"spiral sequence\" for Ladies). The eleven elements required of pair skaters in their free program are detailed in ISU rule 621; they must attempt a maximum of four lifts (including one twist lift), four jumps (including two different throw jumps), one pair spin combination, one death spiral, and one choreographic sequence (previously known as the \"spiral sequence\").<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\n===Component factoring===\nThe panel's points for each Program Component are multiplied by a factor depending on the event. For singles and pair skating, the factor is uniform for all components, as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | | style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Discipline\n!Short<br/>program<br/>(factor)\n!Free<br/>skating<br/>(factor)\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Men\n| 1.0\n| 2.0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Ladies\n| 0.8\n| 1.6\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Pairs\n| 0.8\n| 1.6\n|}\n\nThe factors in Ice Dance are different for each Program Component and depend on the dance type.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\n===Protocol details===\nFollowing an event, the complete judges' scores are published in a document referred to as a ''protocol''. This document uses specific notations as described below.\n\nIf a skater attempts more than the allowed number of a certain type of element in a program, then the element is still described and called as such by the technical controller, but receives a base value of 0 as well as a GOE of 0, regardless of how the judges have marked it. On ISU protocol sheets, elements that have been nullified by this are denoted by an asterisk ('''*''') next to the element name. In free skating, for jumps executed twice as solo jumps, the second jump is marked as '''+REP''' and receives 70% of its base value. Jump elements performed after the halfway point of a program are marked with '''x''' and receive a 10% bonus added to their base value. If a jump has been called as having an unclear take-off edge, that jump is marked with '''!''' and receives a \u20131 to \u20132 GOE depending on severity; if a jump has been called as having an incorrect take-off edge (for example, an inside edge on the take-off of a [[Lutz jump]]), that jump is marked with '''e''' and receives a \u20132 or \u20133 GOE depending on the severity of the edge fault. Jumps that are under-rotated are marked with '''<''' or '''<<''' depending on the degree of turns completed on the ice instead of in mid-air. '''<''' indicates that a jump had less than a \u00bd turn but more than a \u00bc turn completed on the ice, reducing the base value to 70% of its original value. '''<<''' indicates a severe under-rotation (a \u00bd turn or more) and the jump is valued as if it had one less rotation (e.g. a triple would receive the value of a double).<ref name=isu1611>{{cite web |url=http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id=1862 |title=Communication No. 1611 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution |date=4 May 2010 |publisher=[[International Skating Union]] |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513221826/http://isu.sportcentric.net/db/files/serve.php?id=1862 |archive-date=13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nJumps that are executed in combination or sequence are marked as a single element, with a base mark equal to the sum of the base marks for the individual jumps. However, a combination or sequence can be downgraded \u2013 marked with '''+COMBO''' (combinations in the short program) or '''+SEQ''' (combinations and sequences in the free skate) \u2013 in which case the sum of the base values of the jumps is reduced by 80%.\n\n====Scale of Values (SOV) and abbreviations of common elements====\nEvery spring/summer the ISU releases rule updates which include a current Scale of Values (SOV) for different types of element.

The number of rotations on a jump is denoted by the number preceding the element abbreviation. For example, '''3A''' denotes a triple axel, while '''SlSt4''' denotes a level four straight line step sequence. '''ChSt''' and '''ChSq''' are step sequences and spiral sequences that have no level and a fixed base value.\n\n===In ice dance===\n[[Ice dancing|Ice dance]] judging is similar to pairs and singles, but uses a separate set of rules and table of values. In the compulsory dance, steps are specified and \"elements\" are defined for each dance as subsets of the prescribed steps. For compulsory dance only, there is no program component score given for transitions and choreography. Instead there is a timing (TI) program component that is exclusive to the compulsory dance, leaving only four program components in the compulsory dance. In the original dance there are 5 marked technical elements. In the free dance, there are 9 marked technical elements. Unlike singles and pair skating, the different program components are weighted differently in each segment of the competition. The highest factored component(s) in each segment are skating skills and timing in the compulsory dance, interpretation in the original dance, and transitions in the free dance. The exact values of these factors are listed in ISU Rule 543.1k.\n\n== High scores ==\n\nAfter being trialed in 2003, the IJS replaced the old [[6.0 system]] in the 2004\u20132005 figure skating season. Up to and including the [[2017\u20132018 figure skating season|2017\u20132018 season]], the Grade of Execution (GOE) scoring system for each program element ranged between \u20133 and +3. Starting with the 2018\u20132019 season, the GOE was expanded to range between \u20135 and +5. Hence, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) have restarted all records from the 2018\u20132019 season and all previous statistics have been marked as \"historical\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.org/statistics |title=Statistics including Personal Best & Season's Best information |publisher=[[International Skating Union]] |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe ISU only recognizes the best scores that are set at international competitions run under the ISU's rules, and does not recognize, for example, scores that are obtained at national figure skating championships. The competitions recognized by the ISU are: [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] (including the team event), [[Figure skating at the Youth Olympic Games|Youth Olympics]] (including the team event), [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]], [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]], [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|GP events]], [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior GP events]], [[ISU Challenger Series|Challenger Series events]], and [[ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|World Team Trophy]].\n\n=== List of highest scores in figure skating === \n\n*'''Records:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Record holders|current record holders]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Technical and component record scores|technical and component record scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Progression of record scores|progression of record scores]]\n*'''Personal bests:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best scores|highest personal best scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best technical element scores|highest PB technical element scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best program component scores|highest PB program component scores]]\n*'''Absolute bests:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Absolute best scores|lists of absolute best scores]]\n\nFor highest scores achieved prior to the 2018\u20132019 season, see [[List of highest historical scores in figure skating]].\n\n=== List of highest junior scores in figure skating ===\n\n*'''Records:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Junior record holders|current junior record holders]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Technical and component record scores|technical and component record scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Progression of junior record scores|progression of junior record scores]]\n*'''Personal bests:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best scores|highest personal best scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best technical element scores|highest PB technical element scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best program component scores|highest PB program component scores]]\n*'''Absolute bests:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Absolute best scores|lists of absolute best scores]]\n\nFor highest junior scores prior to the 2018\u20132019 season, see [[List of highest historical junior scores in figure skating]].\n\n==Subjectivity==\nLike [[gymnastics]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] competitions, judging in figure skating is intrinsically [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. Although there may be general consensus that one skater \"looks better\" than another, it is difficult to reach agreement on what causes one skater to be marked as 5.5 and another to be 5.75 for a particular program component. As judges, coaches, and skaters gain more experience with the new system, greater consensus may emerge. However, for the 2006 Olympics there were cases of 1 to 1.5 point differences in component marks from different judges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This range of difference implies that \"observer bias\" determines about 20% of the mark given by a judge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Averaging over many judges reduces the effect of this bias in the final score, but there will remain about a 2% spread in the average artistic marks from the randomly selected subsets of judges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nAside from intra-expert subjectivity, skating is very open to misjudgement from everyday spectators who only see skating casually, e.g. every four years at the Olympics. A skater's jump may look perfect, but the general public will not be aware that the competitor landed on an incorrect edge, therefore receiving fewer points for an element, resulting in the appearance of haphazard or biased judging.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe aim of the IJs (ISU Judging System) is to ensure that the judging of figure skating competitions is more consistent with the judging of sports such as [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[gymnastics]]. It also includes features intended to make judging more resistant to pressure by special interests. However, there is debate as to whether the new system is in fact an improvement over the old 6.0 system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/19/winterolympics2006.winterolympics1 |title=Jury is out on skating's latest judging system |first=Clare |last=Balding |date=19 February 2006 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |quote= |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/sports/olympics/despite-revamped-system-for-judging-figure-skating-gets-mixed-marks.html |title=Despite Revamp, Figure Skating Gets Mixed Marks |first1=Mary |last1=Pilon |first2=Jere |last2=Longman |date=5 February 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nInitially under the new ISU rules, the judges' marks were anonymous, which removed any public accountability of the judges for their marks.

It was designed and implemented by the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), the ruling body of the sport. This system of scoring is used in all international competitions sanctioned by the ISU, including the [[Olympic Games]]. The ISU Judging System replaced the previous [[6.0 system]] in 2004. This new system was created in response to the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]], in an attempt to make the scoring system more objective and less vulnerable to abuse.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scoring System Approved|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/sports/sports-briefing.html?ref=internationalskatingunion|access-date=25 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Previous judging system==\n{{main|6.0 system}}\nFigure skating was formerly judged on a 6.0 scale. This scale is sometimes called \"the old scale\", or \"old system\". Skaters were judged on \"technical merit\" (in the free skate), \"required elements\" (in the short program), and \"presentation\" (in both programs). The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0 and were used to determine a preference ranking, or \"ordinal\", separately for each judge; the judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program.\n<!-- \"Lowest scoring\" is correct in the following sentence; 1.0 factored placements beat 2.0 factored placements, and 1.0 is lower than 2.0. -->The highest scoring individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.\n\n==Scandal and response==\n{{main|2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal}}\nIn 2004, after the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal|judging controversy]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the ISU adopted the New Judging System (NJS), or Code of Points, which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Technical panel===\nUnder the ISU Judging System, the base value of each element performed by the skater is identified by the Technical Panel.  The purpose of this panel is to identify all of the elements performed by the skater in real time as they happen.  The panel is also responsible for: any \"technical errors\" to jumps; identifying falls of the skater; and any \"levels of difficulty\" performed in Spins and Steps.\n\nThe Technical Panel is composed of the following five people:\n# The Technical Specialist ('''TS''') who verbally calls the elements as they happen in real time.\n# The Assistant Technical Specialist ('''ATS''') whose primary purpose is to take written notes on all of the elements performed and to contribute to any decisions on technical calls during the \"review of elements\".\n# The Technical Controller ('''TC''') who is there to supervise the panel, and break ties on technical decisions during the \"review of elements\" when the TS and ATS do not agree. The TC is also responsible for \"rule vetting\" the program, and is able to throw out any elements that break the rules for that level and specific program.\n# The Data Operator ('''DO''') who inputs the codes of the elements and levels of difficulty into the computer system.  The DO also flags elements called \"for review\". In the U.S. the DO also replays the video clips of the elements during the review process. The DO is available to assist the TC in the process of \"rule vetting\", in the event that the TC is unsure or makes a mistake.\n# The Video Replay Operator ('''VRO''') who marks clips of elements for review. This person replays the clips in place of the DO in international competitions,<ref>{{Cite book|title=US Figure Skating Rulebook 2017-2018|last=|first=|publisher=US Figure Skating|year=|isbn=|location=Colorado Springs, CO USA|pages=107\u2013108}}</ref> however in the U.S. this person is not involved in the review process.\n\n===Judging panel===\nThe judging panel's primary purpose is to grade the quality of each individual technical element performed by the skater, known as the Grade of Execution (GOE), and the five Program Component Scores (PCS) for each segment of the competition. The five component scores replaced the \"presentation mark\" in the old 6.0 system. At most international events and other large National Championships (such as the U.S. Championships) there are nine judges, but at smaller competitions the panel might consist of between four and seven judges. An odd number of judges was needed to break ties in the old 6.0 system, but this is no longer necessary with averaging marks in the ISU Judging System.\n\n==== Grade of Execution (GOE)====\nThe evaluation of the Grade of Execution (GOE) for each technical element has clear guidelines from the ISU; it ranges from a \"base value\" of 0, to as high as +5 and as low as \u20135. In order to award a positive GOE, a judge needs to identify a certain number of \"positive bullets\" with almost no reductions. One positive bullet is needed for a GOE of +1, two bullets for a +2, three for a +3, four for a +4, and five or more for a GOE of +5. In the case of a negative GOE, a judge must be able to support their evaluation with reference to the published list of reductions. As the skater performs each element, the judges evaluate all phases of the element, possibly weighing both positive and negative aspects of the element in order to determine a final GOE.<ref name=\"ISU2168\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/communications/17142-isu-communication-2168/file|title=ISU Communication No. 2168 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution, season 2018/19 (REVISED)|date=25 June 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|access-date=9 July 2018}}</ref> Prior to the [[2018\u201319 figure skating season|2018&ndash;2019 season]], which started on 1 July 2018, the GOE scoring system ranged from \u20133 to +3, with a base value of 0.<ref name=\"ISU2089\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/ISU%202089-sptc-comm-goe-sov-2017-18.pdf|title=ISU Communication No. 2089 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution, season 2017/18|date=11 May 2017|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]}}</ref> The changes were implemented to allow more accurate scoring factors to be awarded in a sport that is becoming increasingly technical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/communications/17037-isu-communication-2156/file|title=Agenda of the 57th Ordinary Congress, Seville \u2013 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|date=30 April 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nTo aid the process of evaluating only the ''quality'' of an element, while ignoring the ''difficulty'' of the element, the judges are simply shown the element codes on their screens; they do not see the levels of difficulty awarded by the Technical Panel. The judges must be able to support every mark that they have awarded in case they are questioned by the referee after the event.\n\n==== Program Component Scores (PCS)====\n\nThe five program component scores are Skating skills, Transitions, Performance, Composition, and Interpretation. Each mark has individual characteristics that are evaluated; they are scored from 0.25 to 10.00 in quarter-point increments. The scale from zero to ten is an absolute scale, so for example if 6.00 is considered \"above average\" then each judge\u2019s understanding of a 6.00 should remain the same throughout an event and their judging careers.\n\n* ''Skating skills'': This mark assesses the skater's command of the blade over the ice, including the ability to skate with power and ease, forwards and backwards, clockwise and counter-clockwise. How acute is the skater's blade to the ice? How clean and clear are the curves over the ice (known as edge quality)? Skating skills are considered to be excellent if the skater moves quickly and easily, and flows over the ice with soft knees and ankles; but they are judged to be poor if the skating is scratchy and noisy, with the skater pushing from their toes rather than from the sides of the blades.\n* ''Transitions'': This mark evaluates all of the \"in between\" skating when technical elements are not being performed, i.e. whether the skater is merely skating in circles, or incorporating different turns and steps, perhaps also using their arms. A program with good transitions manages to \"thread\" all the elements together, making the skater's program seem effortless. Poor transitions are sometimes non-existent or merely places between the technical elements with a precise \"stopping\" point where the skater begins to prepare for the next element.\n* ''Performance'': This is where the scores start to become slightly more abstract and largely based on the judges' individual opinions. Is the skater physically, emotionally, and mentally involved in their program? Does the skater project to the entire audience and arena? Does the skater have presence on the ice with good carriage? Do they project their own personality while skating?\n* ''Composition'': This mark is concerned with the pattern and spacing over the ice, i.e. how the technical elements are placed throughout the ice surface. Does the skater always skate in the same part of the ice or are they making use of the entire area given to them? Is there a purpose to the way the program is constructed? Maybe their performance is designed to convey an abstract idea like rain or snow; or it might be about a particular story, e.g. when performing to a movie soundtrack or ballet. Does the movement in the program match the phrasing of the music? Perhaps there is meant to be a traditional musical \"call and answer\" or something more abstract.\n* ''Interpretation'': This score reflects how well the judges feel that the skater is performing with their \"soul\" (whereas the Composition score is more about the choreography). Does the skater move in time to the music, or are all the movements just off by a beat or two? Does the skater reflect every little trill and ding with a corresponding skating move?<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/ISU%20program-component-chart_sandp-and-id_08-16.pdf|title=Program Components \u2013 Singles & Pairs, Ice Dance|date=28 August 2016|website=www.usfigureskating.org}}</ref>\n\n==== Computation of scores ====\n\nThe judging panel consists of up to nine judges and one referee. The Technical Panel sends the element codes to the judges' computers for marking. For each element, all of the judges award a mark for Grade of Execution (GOE) that is an integer between \u20135 and +5. The GOE mark is then translated into a value using the Scale of Value (SOV) table which is published regularly by ISU Communications.<ref name=\"isu_rules\">{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating-ice-dance/figure-skating-rules/regulations-rules-fs/file|title=ISU Special Regulations & Technical Rules, Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance, 2018|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> The GOE values from the nine judges are averaged using the \"[[trimmed mean]]\" procedure, where the highest and lowest values are discarded and an average is calculated from the remaining seven values.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" /> This average value (which may be positive or negative) is finally added to the base value to produce the judging panel's overall score for the element.\n\nJudges also mark the Program Components, which are: Skating Skills; Transitions/Linking Footwork; Performance and Execution; Composition and Choreography; and Interpretation and Timing. These Components are marked on a scale of 0.25\u201310 with 0.25 increments and averaged using the same \"trimmed mean\" procedure that was used for averaging the GOE marks. Judges also have the power to input majority deductions such as Music Violations and Costume/Prop Violations. The Referee inputs other deductions such as Time Violations, Interruption in Excess and Costume Failures.\n\n===Technical elements===\nThe number and type of technical elements included in a skating program depend on the event and on the level of competition. At the senior international level, the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]] for both singles and pair skaters must contain seven technical elements. The [[Free skating|free program]] must contain twelve elements for singles and eleven elements for pairs.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\nDetails of the seven elements required of singles skaters in their short program are given in ISU rule 611; the skater must attempt two solo [[Figure skating jumps|jumps]], one combination jump, three [[Figure skating spins|spins]] (including one combination spin and one flying spin), and one [[step sequence]]. The seven elements required of pair skaters in their short program are detailed in ISU rule 620; the pair must attempt two lifts, one side-by-side jump, one throw jump, one spin combination, one [[Death spiral (figure skating)|death spiral]], and one step sequence.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\nThe twelve elements required of singles skaters in their free program are detailed in ISU rule 612; the skater must perform seven jumps, three spins (including one combination spin and one flying spin), one step sequence, and one choreographic sequence (formerly the \"choreographic step sequence\" for Men and the \"spiral sequence\" for Ladies). The eleven elements required of pair skaters in their free program are detailed in ISU rule 621; they must attempt a maximum of four lifts (including one twist lift), four jumps (including two different throw jumps), one pair spin combination, one death spiral, and one choreographic sequence (previously known as the \"spiral sequence\").<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\n===Component factoring===\nThe panel's points for each Program Component are multiplied by a factor depending on the event. For singles and pair skating, the factor is uniform for all components, as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | | style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Discipline\n!Short<br/>program<br/>(factor)\n!Free<br/>skating<br/>(factor)\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Men\n| 1.0\n| 2.0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Ladies\n| 0.8\n| 1.6\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Pairs\n| 0.8\n| 1.6\n|}\n\nThe factors in Ice Dance are different for each Program Component and depend on the dance type.<ref name=\"isu_rules\" />\n\n===Protocol details===\nFollowing an event, the complete judges' scores are published in a document referred to as a ''protocol''. This document uses specific notations as described below.\n\nIf a skater attempts more than the allowed number of a certain type of element in a program, then the element is still described and called as such by the technical controller, but receives a base value of 0 as well as a GOE of 0, regardless of how the judges have marked it. On ISU protocol sheets, elements that have been nullified by this are denoted by an asterisk ('''*''') next to the element name. In free skating, for jumps executed twice as solo jumps, the second jump is marked as '''+REP''' and receives 70% of its base value. Jump elements performed after the halfway point of a program are marked with '''x''' and receive a 10% bonus added to their base value. If a jump has been called as having an unclear take-off edge, that jump is marked with '''!''' and receives a \u20131 to \u20132 GOE depending on severity; if a jump has been called as having an incorrect take-off edge (for example, an inside edge on the take-off of a [[Lutz jump]]), that jump is marked with '''e''' and receives a \u20132 or \u20133 GOE depending on the severity of the edge fault. Jumps that are under-rotated are marked with '''<''' or '''<<''' depending on the degree of turns completed on the ice instead of in mid-air. '''<''' indicates that a jump had less than a \u00bd turn but more than a \u00bc turn completed on the ice, reducing the base value to 70% of its original value. '''<<''' indicates a severe under-rotation (a \u00bd turn or more) and the jump is valued as if it had one less rotation (e.g. a triple would receive the value of a double).<ref name=isu1611>{{cite web |url=http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id=1862 |title=Communication No. 1611 \u2013 Single & Pair Skating \u2013 Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution |date=4 May 2010 |publisher=[[International Skating Union]] |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513221826/http://isu.sportcentric.net/db/files/serve.php?id=1862 |archive-date=13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nJumps that are executed in combination or sequence are marked as a single element, with a base mark equal to the sum of the base marks for the individual jumps. However, a combination or sequence can be downgraded \u2013 marked with '''+COMBO''' (combinations in the short program) or '''+SEQ''' (combinations and sequences in the free skate) \u2013 in which case the sum of the base values of the jumps is reduced by 80%.\n\n====Scale of Values (SOV) and abbreviations of common elements====\nEvery spring/summer the ISU releases rule updates which include a current Scale of Values (SOV) for different types of element. One is released for Singles/Pairs<ref name=\"ISU2089\"/> and another for Ice Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfsa.org/content/ISU%202094-id-scales-of-values-2017-18.pdf|title=ISU Communication No. 2094 \u2013 ICE DANCE Scales of Values, effective July 1st 2017|date=1 July 2017|website=www.usfsa.org}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+\n!

The number of rotations on a jump is denoted by the number preceding the element abbreviation. For example, '''3A''' denotes a triple axel, while '''SlSt4''' denotes a level four straight line step sequence. '''ChSt''' and '''ChSq''' are step sequences and spiral sequences that have no level and a fixed base value.\n\n===In ice dance===\n[[Ice dancing|Ice dance]] judging is similar to pairs and singles, but uses a separate set of rules and table of values. In the compulsory dance, steps are specified and \"elements\" are defined for each dance as subsets of the prescribed steps. For compulsory dance only, there is no program component score given for transitions and choreography. Instead there is a timing (TI) program component that is exclusive to the compulsory dance, leaving only four program components in the compulsory dance. In the original dance there are 5 marked technical elements. In the free dance, there are 9 marked technical elements. Unlike singles and pair skating, the different program components are weighted differently in each segment of the competition. The highest factored component(s) in each segment are skating skills and timing in the compulsory dance, interpretation in the original dance, and transitions in the free dance. The exact values of these factors are listed in ISU Rule 543.1k.\n\n== High scores ==\n\nAfter being trialed in 2003, the IJS replaced the old [[6.0 system]] in the 2004\u20132005 figure skating season. Up to and including the [[2017\u20132018 figure skating season|2017\u20132018 season]], the Grade of Execution (GOE) scoring system for each program element ranged between \u20133 and +3. Starting with the 2018\u20132019 season, the GOE was expanded to range between \u20135 and +5. Hence, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) have restarted all records from the 2018\u20132019 season and all previous statistics have been marked as \"historical\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.org/statistics |title=Statistics including Personal Best & Season's Best information |publisher=[[International Skating Union]] |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe ISU only recognizes the best scores that are set at international competitions run under the ISU's rules, and does not recognize, for example, scores that are obtained at national figure skating championships. The competitions recognized by the ISU are: [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] (including the team event), [[Figure skating at the Youth Olympic Games|Youth Olympics]] (including the team event), [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]], [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]], [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|GP events]], [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior GP events]], [[ISU Challenger Series|Challenger Series events]], and [[ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|World Team Trophy]].\n\n=== List of highest scores in figure skating === \n\n*'''Records:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Record holders|current record holders]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Technical and component record scores|technical and component record scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Progression of record scores|progression of record scores]]\n*'''Personal bests:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best scores|highest personal best scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best technical element scores|highest PB technical element scores]]; [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Highest personal best program component scores|highest PB program component scores]]\n*'''Absolute bests:''' [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Absolute best scores|lists of absolute best scores]]\n\nFor highest scores achieved prior to the 2018\u20132019 season, see [[List of highest historical scores in figure skating]].\n\n=== List of highest junior scores in figure skating ===\n\n*'''Records:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Junior record holders|current junior record holders]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Technical and component record scores|technical and component record scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Progression of junior record scores|progression of junior record scores]]\n*'''Personal bests:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best scores|highest personal best scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best technical element scores|highest PB technical element scores]]; [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Highest personal best program component scores|highest PB program component scores]]\n*'''Absolute bests:''' [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Absolute best scores|lists of absolute best scores]]\n\nFor highest junior scores prior to the 2018\u20132019 season, see [[List of highest historical junior scores in figure skating]].\n\n==Subjectivity==\nLike [[gymnastics]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] competitions, judging in figure skating is intrinsically [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. Although there may be general consensus that one skater \"looks better\" than another, it is difficult to reach agreement on what causes one skater to be marked as 5.5 and another to be 5.75 for a particular program component. As judges, coaches, and skaters gain more experience with the new system, greater consensus may emerge. However, for the 2006 Olympics there were cases of 1 to 1.5 point differences in component marks from different judges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This range of difference implies that \"observer bias\" determines about 20% of the mark given by a judge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Averaging over many judges reduces the effect of this bias in the final score, but there will remain about a 2% spread in the average artistic marks from the randomly selected subsets of judges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nAside from intra-expert subjectivity, skating is very open to misjudgement from everyday spectators who only see skating casually, e.g. every four years at the Olympics. A skater's jump may look perfect, but the general public will not be aware that the competitor landed on an incorrect edge, therefore receiving fewer points for an element, resulting in the appearance of haphazard or biased judging.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe aim of the IJS is to ensure that the judging of figure skating competitions is more consistent with the judging of sports such as [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[gymnastics]]. It also includes features intended to make judging more resistant to pressure by special interests. However, there is debate as to whether the new system is in fact an improvement over the old 6.0 system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/19/winterolympics2006.winterolympics1 |title=Jury is out on skating's latest judging system |first=Clare |last=Balding |date=19 February 2006 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |quote= |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/sports/olympics/despite-revamped-system-for-judging-figure-skating-gets-mixed-marks.html |title=Despite Revamp, Figure Skating Gets Mixed Marks |first1=Mary |last1=Pilon |first2=Jere |last2=Longman |date=5 February 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nInitially under the new ISU rules, the judges' marks were anonymous, which removed any public accountability of the judges for their marks.

The proprietor, John Moy, enlarged the building, and by 1850 it became known as '''Moy's [[Music Hall]]'''.  Alfred Brown took it over in 1863, refurbished it, and renamed it the '''Royal Standard Music Hall'''.\n\nThe hotel was demolished in 1886, by which time the main line terminus, [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria Station]] and its new Grosvenor Hotel, had transformed the area into a major transport hub. The railways were at this time building grand hotel structures at their termini, and Victoria was one of the first. Added to this was the integration of the electric underground system and the building of [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]].  The owner of the music hall, Thomas Dickey, had it rebuilt along more ambitious lines in 1886 by Richard Wake, retaining the name Royal Standard Music Hall.\n\n===Matcham's theatre===\nThe Royal Standard was demolished in 1910, and in its place was built, at a cost of \u00a312,000, the current theatre, The Victoria Palace. It was designed by prolific theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]], and opened 6 November 1911. The original design featured a sliding roof that helped cool the auditorium during intervals in the summer months.\n\nUnder [[impresario]] [[Alfred Butt]], the Victoria Palace Theatre continued the musical theatre tradition by presenting mainly [[variety show|varieties]], and under later managements, [[repertory]] and [[revue]]s.<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/VictoriaPalaceTheatre.htm ''Victoria Palace Theatre''] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history) accessed 12 September 2008</ref> Perhaps because of its music hall linkage, the plays were not always taken seriously. In 1934, the theatre presented ''Young England'', a patriotic play written by the Rev. Walter Reynolds, then 83.  It received such amusingly bad reviews that it became a cult hit and played to full houses for 278 performances before transferring to two other West End theatres.  \n<blockquote>''Intended by its author as a serious work celebrating the triumph of good over evil and the virtues of the [[Boy Scout]] Movement, it was received as an uproarious comedy.  Before long, audiences had learned the key lines and were joining in at all the choicest moments.  The scoutmistress rarely said the line 'I must go and attend to my girls' water' without at least fifty voices in good-humoured support.''</blockquote>\n\nA return to revue brought new success. ''[[Me and My Girl]]'' was a hit in its original production at the theatre, opening in 1937 starring [[Lupino Lane]]. In 1939, songs from this show formed the first live broadcast of a performance by the [[BBC]], and listeners could sing along to ''[[The Lambeth Walk]]''.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article625736.ece ''Still doing the Lambeth Walk'' [[The Times]], 4 September 2006]. Retrieved 24 August 2007</ref> In early 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe, variety was presented under the stewardship of [[Lupino Lane]]. Headlining the bill from his radio series was [[Will Hay]], with his schoolboy retinue of [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] and [[John Clark (actor/director)|John Clark]], and among the \"turns\" was [[Stainless Stephen]], a comic acrobat comedian duo, and Victor Barna (then world champion [[table tennis]] player) giving an exhibition, who would invite audience members up on to the stage to see if they could beat him in ten points. From 1947 through 1962, [[Jack Hylton]] produced ''[[Crazy Gang (comedy group)|The Crazy Gang]]'' series of comedy revues, with a glittering company of variety performers including [[Flanagan and Allen]], [[Nervo and Knox]], and [[Naughton and Gold]].\n\nThe long-running ''[[Black and White Minstrel Show]]'' played through the 1960s until 1972.  In 1982, a production of ''[[The Little Foxes]]'', saw [[Elizabeth Taylor]] making her London stage debut.  Another unusually long-running show at the theatre was ''[[Buddy \u2013 The Buddy Holly Story]]'', that played for 13 years in London, beginning in 1989 (transferring to the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in 1995).  After this, the theatre presented mostly revivals of well-known musicals.  In 2005, ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' opened, garnering rave reviews and Olivier awards.\n\nThe theatre was purchased by [[Stephen Waley-Cohen]] in 1991. At the opening in 1911, a gilded statue of ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]] was positioned above the cupola of the theatre. This was taken down for its safety during [[World War II]], and was lost. In 2006, a replica of the original statue was restored in its place.<ref>[http://www.victoriapalacetheatre.co.uk/History_London_Victoria_Palace_Theatre.html Victoria Palace history].

These states can coincide with social lives and daily routines, making it more difficult to maintain.

It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism. Stimulants and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are used, as well as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[parent management training]].<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nA change of lifestyle habits can assist in relieving the condition of irritability.

These states can coincide with social lives and daily routines, making it more difficult to maintain. Someone is considered for to be irritable when they have a short temper and easily become frustrated in their situation and do not know how to stay calm in a pressured situation. Irritability is considered an emotion and can affect the mood in a negative way.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIrritability is associated with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/irritability.shtml|title=Irritability Anxiety Symptom|last=anxietycentre.com|website=anxietycentre.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The fight or flight responses triggered in the brain can make irritability easily developed and result in severe grouchiness and aggravation towards other people.

It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism. Stimulants and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are used, as well as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[parent management training]].<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nA change of lifestyle habits can assist in relieving the condition of irritability. Recommendations include reducing dietary intake of sodium and sugar. Managing sleep is crucial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/symptom/irritable-mood|title=Irritable mood: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|website=www.healthline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention ==\nOffering help to others and being more sympathetic can change emotions to positive feelings.
