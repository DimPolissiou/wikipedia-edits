It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nTo comply with the current [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] (2015), a snorkel for users with larger lung capacities should not exceed 38 centimeters in length and 230 cubic centimeters in internal volume, while the corresponding figures for users with smaller lung capacities are 35&nbsp;cm and 150&nbsp;cc respectively.<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\">British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving equipment - Snorkels - Requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 2015.</ref> Current [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques|World Underwater Federation (CMAS)]] Surface Finswimming Rules (2017) require snorkels used in official competitions to have a total length between 43 and 48&nbsp;cm and to have an inner diameter between 1.5 and 2.3&nbsp;cm.<ref>''CMAS Finswimming Rules Version 2017/01'', p. 6.

The lungs would then be unable to inflate when the snorkeler inhales, because the [[muscle]]s that expand the lungs are not strong enough to operate against the higher pressure.<ref>R. Stigler, \"Die Taucherei\" in ''Fortschritte der naturwissenschaftlichen Forschung, IX. Band'', Berlin/Wien, 1913.</ref> The pressure difference across the tissues in the lungs, between the blood capillaries and air spaces would increase the risk of [[Swimming-induced pulmonary edema|pulmonary edema]].\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n== Operation ==\n{{main|Snorkelling}}\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is held in the mouth, and allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nSingle snorkels and two-way twin snorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. Twin integrated snorkels with one-way valves eliminate the dead-space of the snorkels themselves, but are usually used on a full-face mask, and even if it has an inner oro-nasal section, there will be some dead space, and the valves will impede airflow through the loop. Integrated two-way snorkels include the internal volume of the mask as dead space in addition to the volume of the snorkels. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply, as this reduces the dead space ratio. Slower breathing will reduce the effort needed to move the air through the circuit. There is a danger that a snorkeler who can breathe comfortably in good conditions will be unable to ventilate adequately under stress or when working harder, leading to [[hypercapnia]] and possible [[panic]], and could get into serious difficulties if they are unable to swim effectively if they have to remove the snorkel or mask to breathe without restriction.\n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve{{clarify|reason=how does this valve work?|date=September 2019}} which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref name=\"patentimages.storage.googleapis.com\">US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI and BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard.\n\n===Scuba diving===\nA snorkel can be useful when scuba diving as it is a safe way of swimming face down at the surface for extended periods to conserve the bottled air supply, or in an emergency situation when there is a problem with either air supply or regulator.<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\"  /> Many dives do not require the use of a snorkel at all, and some scuba divers do not consider a snorkel a necessary or even useful piece of equipment, but the usefulness of a snorkel depends on the dive plan and the dive site. If there is no requirement to swim face down and see what is happening underwater, then a snorkel is not useful. If it is necessary to swim over heavy seaweed which can entangle the pillar valve and regulator if the diver swims face upward to get to and from the dive site, then a snorkel is useful to save breathing gas.\n\n== History ==\nSnorkeling is mentioned by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Parts of Animals]]''. He refers to divers using \"instruments for respiration\" resembling the elephant's [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]].{{r|Aristoteles}}  Some evidence suggests that snorkeling may have originated in Crete some 5,000 years ago as sea sponge farmers used hollowed out reeds to submerge and retrieve natural sponge for use in trade and commerce. In the fifteenth century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew designs for an underwater breathing device consisting of cane tubes with a mask to cover the mouth at the demand end and a float to keep the tubes above water at the supply end.<ref>British Library: ''Online gallery.

This German standard sets safety and testing criteria comparable to British standard BS 4532 with an additional requirement that every snorkel must be topped with a fluorescent red or orange band to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. In November 1988, the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] publishes Austrian standard [[\u00d6NORM S 4223]]<ref>Austrian Standards Institute: \u00d6NORM S 4223: ''Tauch-Zubeh\u00f6r; Schnorchel; Abmessungen, sicherheitstechnische Anforderungen, Pr\u00fcfung, Normkennzeichnung.

The first<ref>British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving accessories - Snorkels - Safety requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 1997.</ref> and second<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\"/> editions of [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] on snorkel requirements and test methods appear in July 1997 and December 2015. This European standard refines snorkel dimension, airflow and joint-strength testing and matches snorkel measurements to the user's height and lung capacity. The snorkels regulated by these British, German, Austrian and European standards exclude combined masks and snorkels in which the snorkel tubes open into the mask.\n\n==Separate snorkels==\nA snorkel may be either separate from, or integrated into, a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated snorkel mask may be a half-mask, which encloses the eyes and nose but excludes the mouth, or a full-face mask, which covers the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nA separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nAlthough snorkels come in many forms, they are primarily classified by their [[dimension]]s and secondarily by their orientation and shape. The [[length]] and the inner [[diameter]] (or inner [[volume]]) of the tube are paramount health and safety considerations when matching a snorkel to the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[End user|end-user]]. The orientation and shape of the tube must also be taken into account when matching a snorkel to its use while seeking to optimise [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] factors such as [[Streamline (swimming)|streamlining]], [[airflow]] and [[Trap (plumbing)|water retention]].\n\n===Dimensions===\nThe total length, inner diameter and internal volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. A long or narrow snorkel tube, or a tube with abrupt changes in direction, or internal surface irregularities will have greater breathing resistance, while a wide tube will have a larger [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]] and may be hard to clear of water. A short tube will be susceptible to swamping by waves.\n\nTo date, all national and international standards on snorkels specify two ranges of tube dimensions to meet the health and safety needs of their end-users, whether young or old, short or tall, with low or high lung capacity. The snorkel dimensions at issue are the total length, the inner diameter and/or the inner volume of the tube. The specifications of the standardisation bodies are tabulated below.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Snorkel standards and rules !! Total length !! Inner diameter !!

The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining. Front-mounted snorkels are attached to the head with a special head bracket fitted with straps to be adjusted and buckled around the temples.\n\nSide-mounted snorkels are generally worn by scuba divers on the left-hand side of the head because the scuba regulator is placed over the right shoulder. They come in at least four basic shapes: J-shaped; L-shaped; Flexible-hose; Contour.<ref>''PADI Diver Manual''. Santa Ana, CA: PADI, 1983, p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Snorkel parts.jpg|thumb|Snorkel parts]]\n* '''A.''' J-shaped snorkels represent the original side-mounted snorkel design, cherished by some for their simplicity but eschewed by others because water accumulates in the U-bend at the bottom.\n* '''B.''' L-shaped snorkels represent an improvement on the J-shaped style. They claim to reduce breathing resistance, to cut water drag and to remove the \"water trap\".\n* '''C.''' Flexible-hose snorkels curry favour with some scuba divers because the flexible hose between the tube and the mouthpiece causes the lower part of the snorkel to drop out of the way when it is no longer in use. However, a spearfisher equipped with this snorkel must have a hand spare to replace the mouthpiece when it falls out of the mouth.\n* '''D.''' Contour snorkels represent the most recent design. They have a \"wraparound\" shape with smooth curves closely following the outline of the wearer's head, which improves wearing comfort.\n\n=== Construction ===\nA snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the demand end at the bottom where the mouthpiece is attached. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and curvature all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a fluorescent red or orange band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head can be seen in the illustration of connection methods.\n* '''A.''' The mask strap is threaded through the permanent plastic loop moulded on to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''B.''' The mask strap is threaded through the separable rubber loop pulled down to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''C.''' The rubber band knotted to the centre of the barrel is stretched over the temple. This method was last used in the USA during the 1950s.\n* '''D.''' The mask strap is threaded through the rotatable plastic snorkel keeper positioned at the centre of the barrel.\n\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nAttached to the demand end of the snorkel at the bottom of the barrel, the mouthpiece serves to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, typically natural rubber and latterly silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P.

Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at end of length of flexible corrugated hose designed for flexible-hose snorkel.\n* '''B.'''

Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs positioned at a right angle and designed for an L-shaped snorkel.\n* '''D.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at the end of a flexible U-shaped elbow designed to be combined with a straight barrel to create a J-shaped snorkel.\n* '''E.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin bite plates offset at an angle from a contoured snorkel.\nA disadvantage of mouthpieces with lugs is the presence of the teeth when breathing. The tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs, the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe.\n[[File:Snorkeling gear.jpg|thumb|right|Typical snorkeling equipment: snorkel, diving mask and swimfins.]]\nSnorkel design is only limited by the imagination.

By creating an airspace in front of the cornea, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. Scuba- and freediving masks consist of flat lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold the mask in place. There are different styles and shapes, which range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose, as there is no need to equalise the internal pressure.\n\n==Integrated snorkels==\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel masks.jpg|thumb|Older swim masks with integrated snorkels]]\nIn this section, usage of the term \"snorkel\" denotes single or multiple tubular devices integrated with, and opening into, a [[Diving mask|swim or dive mask]], while the term \"snorkel-mask\" is used to designate a swim or dive mask with single or multiple built-in snorkels. Such snorkels from the past typically comprised a tube for breathing and a means of connecting the tube to the space inside the snorkel-mask. The tube had an aperture with a shut-off valve at the top and opened at the bottom into the mask, which might cover the mouth as well as the nose and eyes. Although such snorkels tended to be permanent fixtures on historical snorkel-masks, a minority could be detached from their sockets and replaced with plugs enabling certain snorkel-masks to be used without their snorkels.\n\nThe 1950s were the heyday of older-generation snorkel-masks, first for the pioneers of underwater hunting and then for the general public who swam in their wake. One even-minded authority of the time declared that \"the advantage of this kind of mask is mainly from the comfort point of view. It fits snugly to one's face, there is no mouthpiece to bite on, and one can breathe through either nose or mouth\".<ref>Simon Codrington: ''Guide to underwater hunting'', London: Adlard Coles, 1954, pp. 17-18.</ref> Another concluded with absolute conviction that \"built-in snorkel masks are the best\" and \"a must for those who have sinus trouble.\"<ref>Cornel Lumi\u00e8re: ''Beneath the seven seas'', London: Hutchinson, 1956, pp. 18-20, 30.</ref> Yet others, including a co-founder of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], deemed masks with integrated snorkels to be complicated and unreliable: \"Many have the breathing tube built in as an integral part of the mask. I have never seen the advantage of this, and this is the opinion shared by most experienced underwater swimmers I know\".<ref>Peter Small: ''Your guide to underwater adventure'', London: Lutterworth Press, 1957, p. 5.</ref> Six decades on, a new generation of snorkel-masks has come to the marketplace.\n\nLike separate snorkels, integrated snorkels come in a variety of forms. The assortment of older-generation masks with integrated snorkels highlights certain similarities and differences:\n* '''A.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. A permanent single snorkel emerges from the top of the mask and terminates above with a shut-off ball valve.\n* '''B.''' A model with a chinpiece to enclose the eyes, the nose and the mouth. Permanent twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off \"gamma\" valves.\n* '''C.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. Removable twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off ball valves. Supplied with plugs for use without snorkels, as illustrated.\n\nIntegrated snorkels are tentatively classified here by their tube configuration and by the face coverage of the masks to which they are attached.\n\n===Tube configuration===\nAs a rule, early manufacturers and retailers classed integrated snorkel masks by the number of breathing tubes projecting from their tops and sides. Their terse product descriptions often read: \"single snorkel mask\", \"twin snorkel mask\", \"double snorkel mask\" or \"dual snorkel mask\".<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - Florida Frogman No.19''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/f/Florida_Frogman/19.html.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask.\n\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel shutoff valves.jpg|thumb|Shut-off valves fitted to older snorkels]]\nTubes are made of strong but lightweight materials such as plastic. At the supply end, they are fitted with valves made of plastic, rubber or latterly silicone. Three typical shut-off valves are illustrated.\n* '''A.''' Ball valve using a ping-pong ball in a cage to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device may be the most common and familiar valve used atop old-generation snorkels, whether separate or integrated.\n* '''B.''' Hinged \"gamma\" valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was invented in 1954 by [[Luigi Ferraro (naval officer)|Luigi Ferraro]], fitted as standard on every [[Cressi-sub]] mask with integrated breathing tubes and granted US patent 2,815,751 on 10 December 1957.<ref>US Patent US2815751: ''Breathing valve for a submarine mask''. Retrieved on 27 February 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/59/03/10/480531a12da43d/US2815751.pdf.</ref>\n* '''C.''' Sliding float valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was used on Britmarine brand snorkels manufactured by the Haffenden company in [[Sandwich, Kent]] during the 1960s.\nIntegrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nThe skirt of the diving mask attached to the snorkel is made of rubber, or latterly silicone. Older-generation snorkel masks come with a single oval, round or triangular lens retained by a metal clamp in a groove within the body of the mask. An adjustable head strap or harness ensures a snug fit on the wearer's face. The body of a mask with full-face coverage is fitted with a chinpiece to enable a complete leaktight enclosure of the mouth.\n\nOlder proprietary designs came with special facilities. One design separated the eyes and the nose into separate mask compartments to reduce fogging. Another enabled the user to remove integrated snorkels and insert plugs instead, thus converting the snorkel-mask into an ordinary diving mask. New-generation snorkel-masks enclose the nose and the mouth within an inner mask at the demand end directly connected to the single snorkel with its valve at the supply end.\n\n===Half face snorkel masks===\nHalf-face snorkel-masks are standard diving masks featuring built-in breathing tubes topped with shut-off valves. They cover the eyes and the nose only, excluding the mouth altogether. The integral snorkels enable swimmers to keep their mouths closed, inhaling and exhaling air through their noses instead, while they are at, or just below, the surface of the water. When the snorkel tops submerge, their valves are supposed to shut off automatically, blocking nasal respiration and preventing mask flooding.\n\nApart from the integral tubes and their sockets, older half-face snorkel-masks were generally supplied with the same lenses, skirts and straps fitted to standard diving masks without snorkels. Several models of this kind could even be converted to standard masks by replacing their detachable tubes with air- and water-tight plugs. Conversely, the 1950s [[Oscar Gugen|Typhoon]] Super Star<ref>''The Diving Mask''.

Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nThere are numerous mid-twentieth-century examples of commercial snorkel-masks covering the eyes and the nose only. New-generation versions remain relatively rare commodities in the early twenty-first century.\n\n===Full face snorkel masks===\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nMost, but not all, existing new-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some first-generation commercial snorkel-masks were full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others excluded the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only.\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory tidal volume. The main difficulty or danger is that it must fit the whole face perfectly and since no two faces are the same shape, it should be used with great care and in safe water. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth.\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted to create oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by deploying [[3D printing]] and carrying out minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n== Operation ==\n{{main|Snorkelling}}\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is held in the mouth, and allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nSingle snorkels and two-way twin snorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. Twin integrated snorkels with one-way valves eliminate the dead-space of the snorkels themselves, but are usually used on a full-face mask, and even if it has an inner oro-nasal section, there will be some dead space, and the valves will impede airflow through the loop. Integrated two-way snorkels include the internal volume of the mask as dead space in addition to the volume of the snorkels. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply, as this reduces the dead space ratio. Slower breathing will reduce the effort needed to move the air through the circuit. There is a danger that a snorkeler who can breathe comfortably in good conditions will be unable to ventilate adequately under stress or when working harder, leading to [[hypercapnia]] and possible [[panic]], and could get into serious difficulties if they are unable to swim effectively if they have to remove the snorkel or mask to breathe without restriction.\n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve{{clarify|reason=how does this valve work?|date=September 2019}} which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref name=\"patentimages.storage.googleapis.com\">US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI and BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard.\n\n===Scuba diving===\nA snorkel can be useful when scuba diving as it is a safe way of swimming face down at the surface for extended periods to conserve the bottled air supply, or in an emergency situation when there is a problem with either air supply or regulator.<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\"  /> Many dives do not require the use of a snorkel at all, and some scuba divers do not consider a snorkel a necessary or even useful piece of equipment, but the usefulness of a snorkel depends on the dive plan and the dive site. If there is no requirement to swim face down and see what is happening underwater, then a snorkel is not useful. If it is necessary to swim over heavy seaweed which can entangle the pillar valve and regulator if the diver swims face upward to get to and from the dive site, then a snorkel is useful to save breathing gas.\n\n== History ==\nSnorkeling is mentioned by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Parts of Animals]]''. He refers to divers using \"instruments for respiration\" resembling the elephant's [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]].{{r|Aristoteles}}  Some evidence suggests that snorkeling may have originated in Crete some 5,000 years ago as sea sponge farmers used hollowed out reeds to submerge and retrieve natural sponge for use in trade and commerce. In the fifteenth century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew designs for an underwater breathing device consisting of cane tubes with a mask to cover the mouth at the demand end and a float to keep the tubes above water at the supply end.<ref>British Library: ''Online gallery.

This European standard refines snorkel dimension, airflow and joint-strength testing and matches snorkel measurements to the user's height and lung capacity. The snorkels regulated by these British, German, Austrian and European standards exclude combined masks and snorkels in which the snorkel tubes open into the mask.\n\n==Separate snorkels==\nA snorkel may be either separate from, or integrated into, a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated snorkel mask may be a half-mask, which encloses the eyes and nose but excludes the mouth, or a full-face mask, which covers the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nA separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nAlthough snorkels come in many forms, they are primarily classified by their [[dimension]]s and secondarily by their orientation and shape. The [[length]] and the inner [[diameter]] (or inner [[volume]]) of the tube are paramount health and safety considerations when matching a snorkel to the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[End user|end-user]]. The orientation and shape of the tube must also be taken into account when matching a snorkel to its use while seeking to optimise [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] factors such as [[Streamline (swimming)|streamlining]], [[airflow]] and [[Trap (plumbing)|water retention]].\n\n===Dimensions===\nThe total length, inner diameter and internal volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. A long or narrow snorkel tube, or a tube with abrupt changes in direction, or internal surface irregularities will have greater breathing resistance, while a wide tube will have a larger [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]] and may be hard to clear of water. A short tube will be susceptible to swamping by waves.\n\nTo date, all national and international standards on snorkels specify two ranges of tube dimensions to meet the health and safety needs of their end-users, whether young or old, short or tall, with low or high lung capacity. The snorkel dimensions at issue are the total length, the inner diameter and/or the inner volume of the tube. The specifications of the standardisation bodies are tabulated below.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Snorkel standards and rules !! Total length !! Inner diameter !!

The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining. Front-mounted snorkels are attached to the head with a special head bracket fitted with straps to be adjusted and buckled around the temples.\n\nSide-mounted snorkels are generally worn by scuba divers on the left-hand side of the head because the scuba regulator is placed over the right shoulder. They come in at least four basic shapes: J-shaped; L-shaped; Flexible-hose; Contour.<ref>''PADI Diver Manual''. Santa Ana, CA: PADI, 1983, p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Snorkel parts.jpg|thumb|Snorkel parts]]\n* '''A.''' J-shaped snorkels represent the original side-mounted snorkel design, cherished by some for their simplicity but eschewed by others because water accumulates in the U-bend at the bottom.\n* '''B.''' L-shaped snorkels represent an improvement on the J-shaped style. They claim to reduce breathing resistance, to cut water drag and to remove the \"water trap\".\n* '''C.''' Flexible-hose snorkels curry favour with some scuba divers because the flexible hose between the tube and the mouthpiece causes the lower part of the snorkel to drop out of the way when it is no longer in use. However, a spearfisher equipped with this snorkel must have a hand spare to replace the mouthpiece when it falls out of the mouth.\n* '''D.''' Contour snorkels represent the most recent design. They have a \"wraparound\" shape with smooth curves closely following the outline of the wearer's head, which improves wearing comfort.\n\n=== Construction ===\nA snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the demand end at the bottom where the mouthpiece is attached. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and curvature all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a fluorescent red or orange band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head can be seen in the illustration of connection methods.\n* '''A.''' The mask strap is threaded through the permanent plastic loop moulded on to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''B.''' The mask strap is threaded through the separable rubber loop pulled down to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''C.''' The rubber band knotted to the centre of the barrel is stretched over the temple. This method was last used in the USA during the 1950s.\n* '''D.''' The mask strap is threaded through the rotatable plastic snorkel keeper positioned at the centre of the barrel.\n\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nAttached to the demand end of the snorkel at the bottom of the barrel, the mouthpiece serves to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, typically natural rubber and latterly silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P.

Flanged mouthpiece with twin bite plates offset at an angle from a contoured snorkel.\nA disadvantage of mouthpieces with lugs is the presence of the teeth when breathing. The tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs, the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe.\n[[File:Snorkeling gear.jpg|thumb|right|Typical snorkeling equipment: snorkel, diving mask and swimfins.]]\nSnorkel design is only limited by the imagination.

By creating an airspace in front of the cornea, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. Scuba- and freediving masks consist of flat lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold the mask in place. There are different styles and shapes, which range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose, as there is no need to equalise the internal pressure.\n\n==Integrated snorkels==\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel masks.jpg|thumb|Older swim masks with integrated snorkels]]\nIn this section, usage of the term \"snorkel\" denotes single or multiple tubular devices integrated with, and opening into, a [[Diving mask|swim or dive mask]], while the term \"snorkel-mask\" is used to designate a swim or dive mask with single or multiple built-in snorkels. Such snorkels from the past typically comprised a tube for breathing and a means of connecting the tube to the space inside the snorkel-mask. The tube had an aperture with a shut-off valve at the top and opened at the bottom into the mask, which might cover the mouth as well as the nose and eyes. Although such snorkels tended to be permanent fixtures on historical snorkel-masks, a minority could be detached from their sockets and replaced with plugs enabling certain snorkel-masks to be used without their snorkels.\n\nThe 1950s were the heyday of older-generation snorkel-masks, first for the pioneers of underwater hunting and then for the general public who swam in their wake. One even-minded authority of the time declared that \"the advantage of this kind of mask is mainly from the comfort point of view. It fits snugly to one's face, there is no mouthpiece to bite on, and one can breathe through either nose or mouth\".<ref>Simon Codrington: ''Guide to underwater hunting'', London: Adlard Coles, 1954, pp. 17-18.</ref> Another concluded with absolute conviction that \"built-in snorkel masks are the best\" and \"a must for those who have sinus trouble.\"<ref>Cornel Lumi\u00e8re: ''Beneath the seven seas'', London: Hutchinson, 1956, pp. 18-20, 30.</ref> Yet others, including a co-founder of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], deemed masks with integrated snorkels to be complicated and unreliable: \"Many have the breathing tube built in as an integral part of the mask. I have never seen the advantage of this, and this is the opinion shared by most experienced underwater swimmers I know\".<ref>Peter Small: ''Your guide to underwater adventure'', London: Lutterworth Press, 1957, p. 5.</ref> Six decades on, a new generation of snorkel-masks has come to the marketplace.\n\nLike separate snorkels, integrated snorkels come in a variety of forms. The assortment of older-generation masks with integrated snorkels highlights certain similarities and differences:\n* '''A.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. A permanent single snorkel emerges from the top of the mask and terminates above with a shut-off ball valve.\n* '''B.''' A model with a chinpiece to enclose the eyes, the nose and the mouth. Permanent twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off \"gamma\" valves.\n* '''C.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. Removable twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off ball valves. Supplied with plugs for use without snorkels, as illustrated.\n\nIntegrated snorkels are tentatively classified here by their tube configuration and by the face coverage of the masks to which they are attached.\n\n===Tube configuration===\nAs a rule, early manufacturers and retailers classed integrated snorkel masks by the number of breathing tubes projecting from their tops and sides. Their terse product descriptions often read: \"single snorkel mask\", \"twin snorkel mask\", \"double snorkel mask\" or \"dual snorkel mask\".<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - Florida Frogman No.19''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/f/Florida_Frogman/19.html.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask.\n\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel shutoff valves.jpg|thumb|Shut-off valves fitted to older snorkels]]\nTubes are made of strong but lightweight materials such as plastic. At the supply end, they are fitted with valves made of plastic, rubber or latterly silicone. Three typical shut-off valves are illustrated.\n* '''A.''' Ball valve using a ping-pong ball in a cage to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device may be the most common and familiar valve used atop old-generation snorkels, whether separate or integrated.\n* '''B.''' Hinged \"gamma\" valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was invented in 1954 by [[Luigi Ferraro (naval officer)|Luigi Ferraro]], fitted as standard on every [[Cressi-sub]] mask with integrated breathing tubes and granted US patent 2,815,751 on 10 December 1957.<ref>US Patent US2815751: ''Breathing valve for a submarine mask''. Retrieved on 27 February 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/59/03/10/480531a12da43d/US2815751.pdf.</ref>\n* '''C.''' Sliding float valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was used on Britmarine brand snorkels manufactured by the Haffenden company in [[Sandwich, Kent]] during the 1960s.\nIntegrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nThe skirt of the diving mask attached to the snorkel is made of rubber, or latterly silicone. Older-generation snorkel masks come with a single oval, round or triangular lens retained by a metal clamp in a groove within the body of the mask. An adjustable head strap or harness ensures a snug fit on the wearer's face. The body of a mask with full-face coverage is fitted with a chinpiece to enable a complete leaktight enclosure of the mouth.\n\nOlder proprietary designs came with special facilities. One design separated the eyes and the nose into separate mask compartments to reduce fogging. Another enabled the user to remove integrated snorkels and insert plugs instead, thus converting the snorkel-mask into an ordinary diving mask. New-generation snorkel-masks enclose the nose and the mouth within an inner mask at the demand end directly connected to the single snorkel with its valve at the supply end.\n\n===Half face snorkel masks===\nHalf-face snorkel-masks are standard diving masks featuring built-in breathing tubes topped with shut-off valves. They cover the eyes and the nose only, excluding the mouth altogether. The integral snorkels enable swimmers to keep their mouths closed, inhaling and exhaling air through their noses instead, while they are at, or just below, the surface of the water. When the snorkel tops submerge, their valves are supposed to shut off automatically, blocking nasal respiration and preventing mask flooding.\n\nApart from the integral tubes and their sockets, older half-face snorkel-masks were generally supplied with the same lenses, skirts and straps fitted to standard diving masks without snorkels. Several models of this kind could even be converted to standard masks by replacing their detachable tubes with air- and water-tight plugs.

Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nThere are numerous mid-twentieth-century examples of commercial snorkel-masks covering the eyes and the nose only. New-generation versions remain relatively rare commodities in the early twenty-first century.\n\n===Full face snorkel masks===\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nMost, but not all, existing new-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some first-generation commercial snorkel-masks were full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others excluded the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only.\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory tidal volume. The main difficulty or danger is that it must fit the whole face perfectly and since no two faces are the same shape, it should be used with great care and in safe water. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth.\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted into oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by using [[3D printing]] and minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

According to the concept of [[vitalism]] (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\".<ref name=G%E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>  During the first half of the nineteenth century,  some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Michel Chevreul]] started a study of [[soap]]s made from various [[fat]]s and [[alkali]]s. He separated the acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap.  Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from  organic sources), producing new compounds, without \"vital force\". In 1828 [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] produced the ''organic'' chemical [[urea]] (carbamide), a constituent of [[urine]], from ''inorganic'' starting materials (the salts [[potassium cyanate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]]), in what is now called the [[W\u00f6hler synthesis]].  Although W\u00f6hler  himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials.

The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by [[Adolf von Baeyer]]. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from [[petrochemical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Steingruber, Elmar (2004) \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.\n\nThe multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. [[Total synthesis]] of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to [[glucose]] and [[terpineol]]. For example, [[cholesterol]]-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as [[lysergic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]].<ref>{{cite book |author1= Nicolaou, K.C. |author2= Sorensen, E.J. |title= Classics in Total Synthesis: Targets, Strategies, Methods |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] |year= 1996 | isbn= 978-3-527-29231-8 }}</ref>\n[[image:cobalamin.png|thumb|left|230px|The [[total synthesis]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> marked a major achievement in organic chemistry.]]\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] and the development of the [[petrochemical industry]] spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum compounds into ''types'' of compounds by various chemical processes led to [[organic reactions]] enabling a broad range of  industrial and commercial products including, among (many) others: [[plastics]], [[synthetic rubber]], organic [[adhesives]], and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.\n\nThe majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in fact carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and [[biochemistry]] is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the [[history of biochemistry]] might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term ''biochemistry'' was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as [[BIOSIS Previews]] and [[Biological Abstracts]], which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic [[database]].<ref>Allan, Barbara. Livesey, Brian (1994). ''How to Use Biological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts and Index Chemicus''. Gower. {{ISBN|978-0-566-07556-8}}</ref>\n\n== Characterization ==\nSince organic compounds often exist as [[mixture]]s, a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity, especially important being [[chromatography]] techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[gas chromatography]].  Traditional methods of separation include [[distillation]], [[crystallization]], and [[solvent extraction]].\n\nOrganic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests, called \"wet methods\", but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis.<ref>Shriner, R.L.; Hermann, C.K.F.; Morrill, T.C.; Curtin, D.Y. and Fuson, R.C. (1997) ''The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds''. John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-59748-1}}</ref>  Listed in approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is the most commonly used technique, often permitting complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using [[correlation spectroscopy]].  The principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry \u2013 hydrogen and carbon \u2013 exist naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C.\n* [[Elemental analysis]]: A destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule.  See also mass spectrometry, below.\n* [[Mass spectrometry]] indicates the [[molecular weight]] of a compound and, from the [[mass spectrum analysis|fragmentation patterns]], its structure.  High resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in lieu of elemental analysis.  In former times, mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the \"mass spec\" of virtually any organic compound.\n* [[Crystallography]] can be useful for determining [[molecular geometry]] when a single crystal of the material is available.  Highly efficient hardware and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal.\n\nTraditional spectroscopic methods such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[optical rotation]], and [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]] provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds. Traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification.\n\n== Properties ==\nPhysical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features.  Quantitative information includes melting point, boiling point, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties include odor, consistency, solubility, and color.\n\n===Melting and boiling properties===\n\nOrganic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, tending instead to degrade.  In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds.  The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight.  Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime, that is they evaporate without melting.  A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is [[para-dichlorobenzene]], the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs.  Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, although some exceptions exist.\n\n===Solubility===\nNeutral organic compounds tend to be [[hydrophobic]]; that is, they are less [[soluble]] in water than in organic solvents.  Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low [[molecular weight]] [[alcohol]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[carboxylic acid]]s where [[hydrogen bonding]] occurs.  Otherwise organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic [[solvent]]s.  Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.\n\n===Solid state properties===\n\nVarious specialized properties of [[Molecular solid|molecular crystals]] and [[Polymer|organic polymers]] with [[conjugated system]]s are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as [[piezoelectricity]], electrical conductivity (see [[conductive polymer]]s and [[organic semiconductor]]s), and electro-optical (e.g. [[non-linear optics]]) properties.  For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of [[polymer science]] and [[materials science]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}\n[[Image:OrgNom.svg|thumb|center|760px| Various names and depictions for one organic compound.]]\n\nThe names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from [[IUPAC]].  Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a [[parent structure]] within the molecule of interest.  This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome.  Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules.  To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.  Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof.\n\nNonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic chemists.  Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound. They are common for complex molecules, which includes most natural products.  Thus, the informally named [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] is systematically named\n(6a''R'',9''R'')-''N'',''N''-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-''fg''] quinoline-9-carboxamide.\n\nWith the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines.  Two popular formats are [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]].\n\n===Structural drawings===\nOrganic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or [[structural formula]]s, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols.  The [[Bond-line formula|line-angle formula]] is simple and unambiguous.  In this system, the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] carbon.\n[[File:Stuctural drawings of butane 854px.jpg|alt=Structural representations of butane|center|854x854px|This diagram shows 5 different structural representations of the organic compound butane. The left-most structure is a bond-line drawing where the hydrogen atoms are removed. The 2nd structure has the hydrogens added depicted-the dark wedged bonds indicate the hydrogen atoms are coming toward the reader, the hashed bonds indicate the atoms are oriented away from the reader, and the solid (plain) ponds indicate the bonds are in the plane of the screen/paper. The middle structure shows the four carbon atoms. The 4th structure is a representation just showing the atoms and bonds without 3-dimensions. The right-most structure is a condensed structure representation  of butane.]]\n\n===History===\nBy 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard described the situation as \"chaos le plus complet\" as due to the lack of convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This led to the creation of the [[Geneva Rules|Geneva rules]] in 1892.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evieux|first=E. A.|date=1954-06-01|title=The Geneva Congress on Organic Nomenclature, 1892|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=31|issue=6|pages=326|doi=10.1021/ed031p326|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1954JChEd..31..326E}}</ref>\n\n==Classification of organic compounds==\n\n===Functional groups===\n{{Main|Functional group}}\n[[Image:Acetic acid atoms.svg|right|thumb|The family of [[carboxylic]] acids contains a carboxyl (-COOH) [[functional group]]. [[Acetic acid]], shown here, is an example.]]\nThe concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties.  A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]], usually form [[ester]]s, and usually can be converted to the corresponding [[halide]]s.  Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Aliphatic compounds===\n{{Main|Aliphatic compound}}\nThe aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of [[homologous series]] according to their state of [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturation]]:\n* alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any [[Double bond|double]] or [[triple bond]]s, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds\n* alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.\n* alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more triple bonds.\nThe rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present.  Such compounds can be \"straight-chain\", branched-chain or cyclic.  The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the [[octane number]] or [[cetane number]] in petroleum chemistry.\n\nBoth saturated ([[alicyclic]]) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered [[cyclopropane]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. [[Cycloalkane]]s do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the [[cycloalkene]]s and the cycloalkynes do.\n\n===Aromatic compounds===\n[[Image:Benzene-resonance-structures.svg|right|thumb|[[Benzene]] is one of the best-known aromatic compounds as it is one of the simplest and most stable aromatics.]]\n[[Aromatic]] hydrocarbons contain [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds. This means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is [[benzene]], the structure of which was formulated by [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Kekul\u00e9]] who first proposed the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] or [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] principle for explaining its structure.  For \"conventional\" cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer.  Particular instability ([[antiaromaticity]]) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.\n\n===Heterocyclic compounds===\n{{Main|Heterocyclic compound}}\nThe characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a [[heterocycle]].  [[Pyridine]] and [[furan]] are examples of aromatic heterocycles while [[piperidine]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] are the corresponding [[alicyclic]] heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.\n\nHeterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as [[alkaloids]], vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA).\n\nRings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give [[polycyclic compound]]s. The [[purine]] nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles.  Rings can also fuse on a \"corner\" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another.  Such compounds are termed [[spiro compound|spiro]] and are important in a number of [[natural product]]s.\n\n=== Polymers ===\n{{Main|Polymer}}\n\n[[Image:Girl with styrofoam swimming board.jpg|right|thumb|This swimming board is made of [[polystyrene]], an example of a polymer.]]\nOne important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks, that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process is called [[polymerization]], while the chains, or networks, are called [[polymer]]s. The source compound is called a [[monomer]].\n\nTwo main groups of polymers exist: [[synthetic polymers]] and [[biopolymer]]s. Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to as [[plastic|industrial polymers]].<ref>\"industrial polymers, chemistry of.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. 2006</ref> Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.\n\n===Biomolecules===\n[[Image:Maitotoxin 2D structure.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Maitotoxin]], a complex organic biological toxin.]]\n[[Biomolecule|Biomolecular chemistry]] is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by [[biochemists]]. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain [[biopolymer]]s, and these include [[peptides]], [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and the [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]]es in animals and [[cellulose]]s in plants. The other main classes are [[amino acid]]s (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), [[carbohydrate]]s (which includes the polysaccharides), the [[nucleic acid]]s (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the [[lipid]]s. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the [[Krebs cycle]], and produces [[isoprene]], the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important [[steroid]] structural ([[cholesterol]]) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form [[terpene]]s, [[terpenoid]]s, some [[alkaloid]]s, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the [[latex]] of various species of plants, which is the basis for making [[rubber]].\n\n; Peptide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Peptide synthesis]]''\n; Oligonucleotide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Oligonucleotide synthesis]]''\n; Carbohydrate Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Carbohydrate synthesis]]''\n\n=== Small molecules ===\n[[File:CAFENE~1.svg|right|thumb|Molecular models of [[caffeine]].]]\nIn pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is [[small molecule]]s, also referred to as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active, but is not a [[polymer]]. In practice, small molecules have a [[molar mass]] less than approximately 1000 g/mol.\n\n=== Fullerenes ===\n\n[[Fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of [[materials science]]. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces\u2014a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named [[buckminsterfullerene]] (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.\n\n=== Others ===\nOrganic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as [[organosulfur chemistry]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[organophosphorus chemistry]] and [[Organosilicon|organosilicon chemistry]].\n\n== Organic reactions ==\n[[Organic reaction]]s are [[chemical reaction]]s involving [[organic compound]]s. Many of these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the [[electron affinity]] of key atoms, [[bond strength]]s and [[steric hindrance]]. These factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived [[reactive intermediate]]s, which usually directly determine the path of the reaction.\n\nThe basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions. An example of a common reaction is a [[substitution reaction]] written as:\n\n:Nu<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  C-X  \u2192 C-Nu + X<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nwhere X is some [[functional group]] and Nu is a [[nucleophile]].\n\nThe number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence\u2014although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.\n\nThe stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using  [[arrow pushing]] techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products.\n\n== Organic synthesis ==\n{{see also|Chemical synthesis|Organic synthesis}}\n[[Image:Corey oseltamivir synthesis.png|thumb|right|261px|A synthesis designed by [[E.J. Corey]] for [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu). This synthesis has 11 distinct reactions.]]\n\nSynthetic organic chemistry is an [[applied science]] as it borders [[engineering]], the \"design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes\". Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a [[carbonyl]] compound can be used as a [[nucleophile]] by converting it into an [[enolate]], or as an [[electrophile]]; the combination of the two is called the [[aldol reaction]]. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called [[total synthesis]].\n\nStrategies to design a synthesis include [[retrosynthesis]], popularized by [[E.J. Corey]], which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis. A \"synthetic tree\" can be constructed, because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of organic chemistry}}\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Organic chemistry|Important publications in organic chemistry]]\n* [[List of organic reactions]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WVD}}\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/ MIT.edu], OpenCourseWare: Organic Chemistry I\n* [http://www.haverford.edu/wintnerorganicchem HaverFord.edu], Organic Chemistry Lectures, Videos and Text\n* [https://www.organic-chemistry.org Organic-Chemistry.org], Organic Chemistry Portal \u2013 Recent Abstracts and (Name)Reactions\n* [http://www.orgsyn.org/ Orgsyn.org], Organic Chemistry synthesis journal\n* [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry Khanacademy.org], [[Khan Academy]] - Organic Chemistry\n{{Organic chemistry}}\n{{BranchesofChemistry}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organic Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Organic chemistry| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Organic compounds|Chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Subdiscipline of chemistry}}\n[[File:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Methane]], CH<sub>4</sub>; the line-angle structural formula shows four carbon-hydrogen single bonds (\u03c3, in black), and the typical [[three dimensional|3D]] shape of [[tetrahedral geometry|tetrahedral]] molecules, with ~109\u00b0 interior [[bond angle]]s (in dashed-green).]]\n\n'''Organic chemistry''' is a subdiscipline of [[chemistry]] that studies the structure, properties and reactions of [[organic compound]]s, which contain [[carbon]] in [[covalent bonding]].<ref name=\"J.

The bonding patterns of carbon, with its [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] of four\u2014formal single, double, and triple bonds, plus structures with delocalized electrons\u2014make the array of organic compounds structurally diverse, and their range of applications enormous. They form the basis of, or are constituents of, many commercial products including [[drug|pharmaceuticals]]; [[petrochemical]]s and [[agrichemical]]s, and products made from them including [[lubricants]], [[solvents]]; [[plastic]]s; [[fuels]] and [[explosive material|explosives]]. The study of organic chemistry overlaps [[organometallic chemistry]] and  [[biochemistry]], but also with [[medicinal chemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], and [[materials science]].<ref name=\"J.

According to the concept of [[vitalism]] (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\".<ref name=G%E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>  During the first half of the nineteenth century,  some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Michel Chevreul]] started a study of [[soap]]s made from various [[fat]]s and [[alkali]]s. He separated the acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap.  Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from  organic sources), producing new compounds, without \"vital force\". In 1828 [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] produced the ''organic'' chemical [[urea]] (carbamide), a constituent of [[urine]], from ''inorganic'' starting materials (the salts [[potassium cyanate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]]), in what is now called the [[W\u00f6hler synthesis]].  Although W\u00f6hler  himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|author2=Herbert S.

The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by [[Adolf von Baeyer]]. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from [[petrochemical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Steingruber, Elmar (2004) \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.\n\nThe multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. [[Total synthesis]] of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to [[glucose]] and [[terpineol]]. For example, [[cholesterol]]-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as [[lysergic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]].<ref>{{cite book |author1= Nicolaou, K.C. |author2= Sorensen, E.J. |title= Classics in Total Synthesis: Targets, Strategies, Methods |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] |year= 1996 | isbn= 978-3-527-29231-8 }}</ref>\n[[image:cobalamin.png|thumb|left|230px|The [[total synthesis]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> marked a major achievement in organic chemistry.]]\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] and the development of the [[petrochemical industry]] spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum compounds into ''types'' of compounds by various chemical processes led to [[organic reactions]] enabling a broad range of  industrial and commercial products including, among (many) others: [[plastics]], [[synthetic rubber]], organic [[adhesives]], and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.\n\nThe majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in fact carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and [[biochemistry]] is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the [[history of biochemistry]] might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term ''biochemistry'' was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as [[BIOSIS Previews]] and [[Biological Abstracts]], which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic [[database]].<ref>Allan, Barbara. Livesey, Brian (1994). ''How to Use Biological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts and Index Chemicus''. Gower. {{ISBN|978-0-566-07556-8}}</ref>\n\n== Characterization ==\nSince organic compounds often exist as [[mixture]]s, a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity, especially important being [[chromatography]] techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[gas chromatography]].  Traditional methods of separation include [[distillation]], [[crystallization]], and [[solvent extraction]].\n\nOrganic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests, called \"wet methods\", but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis.<ref>Shriner, R.L.; Hermann, C.K.F.; Morrill, T.C.; Curtin, D.Y. and Fuson, R.C. (1997) ''The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds''. John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-59748-1}}</ref>  Listed in approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is the most commonly used technique, often permitting complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using [[correlation spectroscopy]].  The principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry \u2013 hydrogen and carbon \u2013 exist naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C.\n* [[Elemental analysis]]: A destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule.  See also mass spectrometry, below.\n* [[Mass spectrometry]] indicates the [[molecular weight]] of a compound and, from the [[mass spectrum analysis|fragmentation patterns]], its structure.  High resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in lieu of elemental analysis.  In former times, mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the \"mass spec\" of virtually any organic compound.\n* [[Crystallography]] can be useful for determining [[molecular geometry]] when a single crystal of the material is available.  Highly efficient hardware and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal.\n\nTraditional spectroscopic methods such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[optical rotation]], and [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]] provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds. Traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification.\n\n== Properties ==\nPhysical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features.  Quantitative information includes melting point, boiling point, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties include odor, consistency, solubility, and color.\n\n===Melting and boiling properties===\n\nOrganic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, tending instead to degrade.  In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds.  The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight.  Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime, that is they evaporate without melting.  A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is [[para-dichlorobenzene]], the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs.  Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, although some exceptions exist.\n\n===Solubility===\nNeutral organic compounds tend to be [[hydrophobic]]; that is, they are less [[soluble]] in water than in organic solvents.  Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low [[molecular weight]] [[alcohol]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[carboxylic acid]]s where [[hydrogen bonding]] occurs.  Otherwise organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic [[solvent]]s.  Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.\n\n===Solid state properties===\n\nVarious specialized properties of [[Molecular solid|molecular crystals]] and [[Polymer|organic polymers]] with [[conjugated system]]s are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as [[piezoelectricity]], electrical conductivity (see [[conductive polymer]]s and [[organic semiconductor]]s), and electro-optical (e.g. [[non-linear optics]]) properties.  For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of [[polymer science]] and [[materials science]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}\n[[Image:OrgNom.svg|thumb|center|760px| Various names and depictions for one organic compound.]]\n\nThe names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from [[IUPAC]].  Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a [[parent structure]] within the molecule of interest.  This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome.  Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules.  To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.  Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof.\n\nNonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic chemists.  Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound. They are common for complex molecules, which includes most natural products.  Thus, the informally named [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] is systematically named\n(6a''R'',9''R'')-''N'',''N''-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-''fg''] quinoline-9-carboxamide.\n\nWith the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines.  Two popular formats are [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]].\n\n===Structural drawings===\nOrganic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or [[structural formula]]s, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols.  The [[Bond-line formula|line-angle formula]] is simple and unambiguous.  In this system, the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] carbon.\n[[File:Stuctural drawings of butane 854px.jpg|alt=Structural representations of butane|center|854x854px|This diagram shows 5 different structural representations of the organic compound butane. The left-most structure is a bond-line drawing where the hydrogen atoms are removed. The 2nd structure has the hydrogens added depicted-the dark wedged bonds indicate the hydrogen atoms are coming toward the reader, the hashed bonds indicate the atoms are oriented away from the reader, and the solid (plain) ponds indicate the bonds are in the plane of the screen/paper. The middle structure shows the four carbon atoms. The 4th structure is a representation just showing the atoms and bonds without 3-dimensions. The right-most structure is a condensed structure representation  of butane.]]\n\n===History===\nBy 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard described the situation as \"chaos le plus complet\" as due to the lack of convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This led to the creation of the [[Geneva Rules|Geneva rules]] in 1892.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evieux|first=E. A.|date=1954-06-01|title=The Geneva Congress on Organic Nomenclature, 1892|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=31|issue=6|pages=326|doi=10.1021/ed031p326|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1954JChEd..31..326E}}</ref>\n\n==Classification of organic compounds==\n\n===Functional groups===\n{{Main|Functional group}}\n[[Image:Acetic acid atoms.svg|right|thumb|The family of [[carboxylic]] acids contains a carboxyl (-COOH) [[functional group]]. [[Acetic acid]], shown here, is an example.]]\nThe concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties.  A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]], usually form [[ester]]s, and usually can be converted to the corresponding [[halide]]s.  Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Aliphatic compounds===\n{{Main|Aliphatic compound}}\nThe aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of [[homologous series]] according to their state of [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturation]]:\n* alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any [[Double bond|double]] or [[triple bond]]s, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds\n* alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.\n* alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more triple bonds.\nThe rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present.  Such compounds can be \"straight-chain\", branched-chain or cyclic.  The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the [[octane number]] or [[cetane number]] in petroleum chemistry.\n\nBoth saturated ([[alicyclic]]) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered [[cyclopropane]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. [[Cycloalkane]]s do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the [[cycloalkene]]s and the cycloalkynes do.\n\n===Aromatic compounds===\n[[Image:Benzene-resonance-structures.svg|right|thumb|[[Benzene]] is one of the best-known aromatic compounds as it is one of the simplest and most stable aromatics.]]\n[[Aromatic]] hydrocarbons contain [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds. This means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is [[benzene]], the structure of which was formulated by [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Kekul\u00e9]] who first proposed the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] or [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] principle for explaining its structure.  For \"conventional\" cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer.  Particular instability ([[antiaromaticity]]) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.\n\n===Heterocyclic compounds===\n{{Main|Heterocyclic compound}}\nThe characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a [[heterocycle]].  [[Pyridine]] and [[furan]] are examples of aromatic heterocycles while [[piperidine]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] are the corresponding [[alicyclic]] heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.\n\nHeterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as [[alkaloids]], vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA).\n\nRings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give [[polycyclic compound]]s. The [[purine]] nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles.  Rings can also fuse on a \"corner\" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another.  Such compounds are termed [[spiro compound|spiro]] and are important in a number of [[natural product]]s.\n\n=== Polymers ===\n{{Main|Polymer}}\n\n[[Image:Girl with styrofoam swimming board.jpg|right|thumb|This swimming board is made of [[polystyrene]], an example of a polymer.]]\nOne important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks, that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process is called [[polymerization]], while the chains, or networks, are called [[polymer]]s. The source compound is called a [[monomer]].\n\nTwo main groups of polymers exist: [[synthetic polymers]] and [[biopolymer]]s. Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to as [[plastic|industrial polymers]].<ref>\"industrial polymers, chemistry of.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. 2006</ref> Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.\n\n===Biomolecules===\n[[Image:Maitotoxin 2D structure.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Maitotoxin]], a complex organic biological toxin.]]\n[[Biomolecule|Biomolecular chemistry]] is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by [[biochemists]]. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain [[biopolymer]]s, and these include [[peptides]], [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and the [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]]es in animals and [[cellulose]]s in plants. The other main classes are [[amino acid]]s (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), [[carbohydrate]]s (which includes the polysaccharides), the [[nucleic acid]]s (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the [[lipid]]s. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the [[Krebs cycle]], and produces [[isoprene]], the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important [[steroid]] structural ([[cholesterol]]) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form [[terpene]]s, [[terpenoid]]s, some [[alkaloid]]s, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the [[latex]] of various species of plants, which is the basis for making [[rubber]].\n\n; Peptide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Peptide synthesis]]''\n; Oligonucleotide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Oligonucleotide synthesis]]''\n; Carbohydrate Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Carbohydrate synthesis]]''\n\n=== Small molecules ===\n[[File:CAFENE~1.svg|right|thumb|Molecular models of [[caffeine]].]]\nIn pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is [[small molecule]]s, also referred to as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active, but is not a [[polymer]]. In practice, small molecules have a [[molar mass]] less than approximately 1000 g/mol.\n\n=== Fullerenes ===\n\n[[Fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of [[materials science]]. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces\u2014a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named [[buckminsterfullerene]] (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.\n\n=== Others ===\nOrganic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as [[organosulfur chemistry]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[organophosphorus chemistry]] and [[Organosilicon|organosilicon chemistry]].\n\n== Organic reactions ==\n[[Organic reaction]]s are [[chemical reaction]]s involving [[organic compound]]s. Many of these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the [[electron affinity]] of key atoms, [[bond strength]]s and [[steric hindrance]]. These factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived [[reactive intermediate]]s, which usually directly determine the path of the reaction.\n\nThe basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions. An example of a common reaction is a [[substitution reaction]] written as:\n\n:Nu<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  C-X  \u2192 C-Nu + X<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nwhere X is some [[functional group]] and Nu is a [[nucleophile]].\n\nThe number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence\u2014although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.\n\nThe stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using  [[arrow pushing]] techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products.\n\n== Organic synthesis ==\n{{see also|Chemical synthesis|Organic synthesis}}\n[[Image:Corey oseltamivir synthesis.png|thumb|right|261px|A synthesis designed by [[E.J. Corey]] for [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu). This synthesis has 11 distinct reactions.]]\n\nSynthetic organic chemistry is an [[applied science]] as it borders [[engineering]], the \"design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes\". Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a [[carbonyl]] compound can be used as a [[nucleophile]] by converting it into an [[enolate]], or as an [[electrophile]]; the combination of the two is called the [[aldol reaction]]. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called [[total synthesis]].\n\nStrategies to design a synthesis include [[retrosynthesis]], popularized by [[E.J. Corey]], which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis. A \"synthetic tree\" can be constructed, because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of organic chemistry}}\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Organic chemistry|Important publications in organic chemistry]]\n* [[List of organic reactions]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WVD}}\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/ MIT.edu], OpenCourseWare: Organic Chemistry I\n* [http://www.haverford.edu/wintnerorganicchem HaverFord.edu], Organic Chemistry Lectures, Videos and Text\n* [https://www.organic-chemistry.org Organic-Chemistry.org], Organic Chemistry Portal \u2013 Recent Abstracts and (Name)Reactions\n* [http://www.orgsyn.org/ Orgsyn.org], Organic Chemistry synthesis journal\n* [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry Khanacademy.org], [[Khan Academy]] - Organic Chemistry\n{{Organic chemistry}}\n{{BranchesofChemistry}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organic Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Organic chemistry| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Organic compounds|Chemistry]]\n", "name_user": "39.48.123.253", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry"}

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s. St Giles' is one of a number of former cathedrals in the Church of Scotland \u2013 such as [[Glasgow Cathedral]] or [[Dunblane Cathedral]] \u2013 that retain their title despite having lost this status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2016/24-june/regulars/out-of-the-question/church-of-scotland-cathedrals|title=Church of Scotland cathedrals?|website=churchtimes.co.uk|access-date=29 September 2019}}</ref> Since the church's initial elevation to cathedral status, the building as a whole has generally been called St Giles' Cathedral, St Giles' Kirk or Church, or simply St Giles'.<ref>Lees 1889, p. 205.</ref>\n\nThe title \"High Kirk\" is briefly attested during the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI]] as referring to the whole building.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

It is even referred to as '''Coringa''' by the [[East India Company|Britishers]] because of the proximity of its [[Port|Sea Port]] to the [[Koringa River|river Koringa]].\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] also called it '''Cocanada''' when they established the first Canadian Baptist Mission. After [[Independence of India|Independence]], it finally got the name '''Kakinada'''. Some theories suggest Kakasura's losing his eye by an arrow of [[Lord Rama]] gave the name ''Kakinada'' or that ''Kaki Nandivada'' is derived from (''Kaka'', an [[Ikshvaku]] king) who built the town.

Constantinople was the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which ended with the [[fall of Constantinople|Muslim conquest]] in 1453.  Constantinople then became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPopulation had declined during the medieval period, but as the Ottoman Empire approached its historical peak, the city grew to a population of close to 700,000 in the 16th century, once again ranking among the world's most populous cities. When the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded in 1923, the capital was moved from Constantinople to [[Ankara]] (previously Angora).

Byzantium (now renamed as ''Nova Roma'' which eventually became ''Constantinopolis'', i.e. ''The City of Constantine'') was officially proclaimed the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.  At the end of his reign in 337, Constantine declared his three sons as joint heirs of the Roman Empire in a system of co-emperorship.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\">Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 248</ref> However, the sons couldn't govern together peacefully and their military rivalry split the empire on the north\u2013south line along the Balkan Peninsula. The territory was officially split in 395 when [[Theodosius I]] (ruled, 379-395) died, leaving his son Honorius emperor of the western half, and his other son Arcadius emperor of the eastern half of the empire.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 248\"/>\n\nConstantinople became the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]]. The combination of [[empire|imperial]] power and a key location at the crossing point between the [[continent]]s of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and later [[Africa]] and others regions, played an important role in terms of [[commerce]], [[culture]], [[diplomacy]], and [[strategy]]. It was the center of the Greek world and, for most of the Byzantine period, the largest city in Europe. Constantine's conversion to [[Christianity]], in 312, had set the Roman Empire towards Christianization, and in 381, during the reign of Theodosius I, the official state religion of the Roman Empire became Christianity, turning Constantinople into a thriving religious center.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 253</ref>\n\nThroughout the fifth century, the western half of the [[Roman Empire]] lost most of its power through decline in political, economic and social situations, the last western emperor being deposed by Germanic mercenaries in AD 476; the eastern half, however, was flourishing. According to historians this flourishing Eastern Roman Empire was then classified as the Byzantine Empire to distinguish it from the Roman Empire.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 272</ref> This empire was distinctly Greek in culture, and became the centre of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]] after an earlier [[East-West Schism|split]] with Rome, and was adorned with many magnificent [[Church (building)|churches]], including [[Hagia Sophia]], once the world's largest [[cathedral]]. The seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], remains. \n\nThe most famous Byzantine emperor was [[Justinian]] (527-565). During his reign he extended the Byzantine Empire to its largest boundaries spreading from Palestine to the tip of Spain. His other achievements include the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] church and the organized law system called the [[Codex]] which was completed in 534.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 273\u2013276</ref> However, Justinian's reign was the greatest influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nStarting in the 600's, warfare kept Constantinople's power flip-flopping between decline and progression. Alliance with Europe slowly began to break away from the Byzantine Empire between the seventh-eighth centuries, when the Byzantine and Roman churches disagreed on various subjects. However, the distinguishing gap placed between the two churches involved the use of icons in the church. Icons, being images of Christian holy people such as [[Jesus Christ]], the Virgin Mary and the saints, to Byzantine Christians were more than representations; they were believed to possess holy power that affected people's daily lives<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 291</ref> While many Byzantines worshiped icons many opposed the icons because they tested the authorities of the emperor. Finally in 726, Emperor Leo III (ruled, 717-741) ordered all icons to be destroyed. The destruction of icons reorganized and reoriented the Byzantine rulers in imperial power.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 292</ref> The fierce opposition to icons clashed with the pope's tolerance of images. The papacy was unwilling to permit sacred images and icons to be destroyed and this caused eventual separation.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 313\u2013314</ref> Their separation caused hatred between the two churches and cooperation between the two was a struggle.\n\nFrom around the 9th to 13th centuries, Constantinople developed complex relationships with an emerging and later the largest and most advanced state of that time in [[Europe]] - [[Kiev Rus]]. Constantinople played a significant role in the [[Kiev Rus]] development, culture, and politics. Many of the Kiev Princes were married to daughters of the Byzantine Emperors, and because of this connection Eastern Europe became Orthodox, after it was Christianized by [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kiev]]. However these relationships were not always friendly - Constantinople was sacked several times over those 400 years by Kiev Princes, forcing Constantinople to sign increasingly favorable treaties for [[Kiev]], the texts of which were preserved in the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other historical documents (see [[Rus'-Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'-Byzantine War]]s).  Byzantine constantly played Kiev, Poland, Bulgaria, and other European Nations of that time, against each other.\n\nNear 1204, Constantinople began to decline in power. Because of the failure of the Third Crusade, self-confident western Europeans decided to again try to capture the Holy City of Jerusalem in the [[Fourth Crusade]]; but this time their plan was to capture the Byzantine Empire as well. In 1204, western armies captured Constantinople and ransacked the city for treasures.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\">Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 427</ref> The pope decried the sacking of Constantinople but ordered the crusaders to consolidate their gains in the city for a year. The crusaders chose Baldwin of Flanders to be the new Byzantine Emperor; he along with other princes and the Venetians divided the Empire amongst themselves; they never made it to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> This new [[Latin Empire]] at Constantinople lasted until 1261, when the Byzantines under the command of [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] recaptured the city and some outlying territory.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> After this, Constantinople never regained its former glory. Rather than a thriving metropolis, Constantinople transformed into a collection of villages, and became a semi-[[ghost town]] with, as [[Ibn Battuta]] noted, sown fields within the city walls. The city by 1453 held less than a tenth of its former population.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\nThe city, known alternatively in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as ''\u1e32os\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bn\u012bye'' ({{lang|ota|\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0647|rtl=yes}} after the Arabic form {{lang|ar-Latn|al-Qus\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bniyyah}} {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629|rtl=yes}}) or Istanbul (while its Christian minorities continued to name it Constantinople), was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from its conquest in 1453 until the empire's collapse in 1922.\n\n===Conquest===\n{{further|Fall of Constantinople}}\n\n[[File:Melchior Lorck - The Prospect of Constantinople (section).jpg|thumb|[[Melchior Lorck]] - The Prospect of Constantinople (16th century)]]\nOn 29 May 1453, [[Sultan Mehmed II]] \"the Conqueror\", entered [[Constantinople]] after a 53\u2013day [[siege]] during which his cannon had torn a huge hole in the [[Walls of Constantinople|Walls of Theodosius II]]. The city became the third capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nMehmed had begun the siege on 6 April 1453. He had hired engineers to build [[cannons]] and bombs for the occasion. He also acquired scholars and imams to encourage the soldiers. In accordance with [[Shariah]] (Muslim Holy Law), Mehmed gave the Byzantine emperor Constantine Palaeologus (1449\u20131453) three chances to surrender the city.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/> He guaranteed the safety of the city's residents, with their riches, beliefs and honor. Constantine valiantly refused the offer.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2012-05-31). p. 6</ref>\nAfter more than a month of fighting, Mehmed's advisors were beginning to lose hope. Against their counsel, Mehmed continued to fight. The night before the final assault, he studied previous attempts to take the city to distinguish potentially successful approaches. On the morning of 29 May 1453 the sultan ordered  [[Adzan]] (the call to prayer).<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\">Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288 to 1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig. New York: Howard Fertig Inc., 1924. p. 2</ref> This was not a regular prayer session for religious reasons but rather a scare tactic: the sight of the entire Ottoman army getting on their knees to pray provided an intimidating display of unity to the Byzantine forces designed to overcome their minds before their bodies.<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\"/>\n\nOnce the fighting started, it went on for forty-eight days. The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response the Papacy sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. The Ottoman ships burnt the Byzantine ones in a naval battle.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). p. 7</ref>\n\n<!-- {{wide image||1000px|Panoramic view of the [[Golden Horn]] in Istanbul, as seen from the [[Galata Tower]].

This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city.

Mehmed entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]]. He immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]] which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: \"I testify that there is no God but [[Allah]]. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.\"<ref>Lewis, Bernard. Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6</ref> He turned the Orthodox cathedral into a Turkish [[mosque]], solidifying Turkish rule in Constantinople.\nMehmed ordered the city to be plundered for three days; during this time, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of casualties, rapes and forced deportations.<ref>Mansel, Philip (1995).

Hachette UK. p. 79. {{ISBN|0-7195-5076-9}}.</ref>\nFollowing the sack, Mehmed's main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city's defenses and re-population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249</ref> Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be deported to Constantinople by September.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969 p. 236\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249. p. 236</ref>\n\n===Imperial capital===\nBy 1459, the Sultan dedicated a lot of energy to bringing prosperity to Constantinople. In several quarters of the city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, now of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/>\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign over the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566 was a period of great artistic and architectural achievements. The famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] designed many mosques and other grand buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished. Many [[Zawiyya|tekkes]] survive to this day; some in the form of mosques while others have become museums such as the [[Jerrahi|Cerrahi]] Tekke and the [[S\u00fcnb\u00fcl Efendi]] and Ramazan Efendi mosques and [[t\u00fcrbe]]s in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihanesi in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Efendi tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi|Bekta\u015fi]] Tekke in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[cemevi]].\n\n{{wide image|Bosphorus Istanbul 2007.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the historic peninsula of Istanbul, looking westwards from the southern entrance of the [[Bosporus|Bosporus Strait]] at the [[Sea of Marmara]].

For [[Mehmet II]], conquest was only the first stage; the second was giving the old city an entirely new cosmopolitan social structure. Most of what remained of the Byzantine population - a mere 30,000 persons - was deported. According to the Ashikpashazade, a Turkish chronicle,\n\n<blockquote>\nMehmet then sent officers to all his lands to announce that whoever wished should come and take possession in Constantinople, as freehold, of houses and orchards and gardens ... Despite this measure the city was not repopulated. So then the Sultan commanded that from every land families, rich and poor alike, should be brought in by force ... and now the city began to be populous.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Europe's Muslim Capital |last=Mansel |first=Philip |work=History Today |volume=53 |issue=6 |date=July 2003 |url= http://www.historytoday.com/philip-mansel/europes-muslim-capital }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 1.jpg|thumb|View of Constantinople, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]\nMehmet took much personal interest in the creation of his new capital. On his orders the great mosque and the college of Fatih were built on the old burial grounds of the Byzantine Emperors at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]]. Bit by bit the great Christian city was transformed into a great Muslim city. Even so, the city was not to be entirely Muslim, at least not until the late 20th century. [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Armenians]], all of whose diverse skills were needed, were allowed to settle in a city which was to become known as ''alem penah''-refuge of the universe. According to the census of 1477, there were 9,486 houses occupied by Muslims; 3,743 by Greeks; 1,647 by Jews; 267 by Christians from the Crimea, and 31 Gypsies. Mehmet also re-established Constantinople, as it was still called at that time, as the center of the Orthodox patriarchate. [[File:View of the Seraglio Point from Pera.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Seraglio Point]] from [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], with the [[Bosphorus]] at left, the entrance of the [[Golden Horn]] at right, and the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Princes' Islands]] on the horizon]]\n\nThere was also an Italian community in the area of the [[Galata Tower]]. Having surrendered before the fall of the city, Mehmet allowed them to preserve an element of self-government. For generations after, they supplied interpreters and diplomats for the Ottoman Court. After the conquest of Egypt in 1517, and the Sultan's acceptance of the position of Caliph, Constantinople acquired an additional importance in Muslim eyes. Mosques built by [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] and his successors gave the city the unique appearance it still preserves today. The individual communities, though, still lived in self-contained areas, and had little in the way of social interaction, a source of future trouble.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, living standards were at least equal to most of Europe. For example, the development of urban craftsmen's wages was on a level similar to southern and central Europe during the sixteenth to eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] (1455) and [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] (1459) were erected in the years following the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]ish conquest. Religious foundations were endowed to fund the building of mosques such as the [[Fatih Mosque|Fatih]] (1463) and their associated [[school]]s and [[public bath]]s. The city had to be repopulated by a mixture of force and encouragement.\n\n[[File:Istanbul by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|''Kostantiniyye'' from the \"Book of Navigation\" by  [[Piri Reis]], ca. 1525]]\n\nS\u00fcleyman's reign was a time of great [[artistic]] and [[architectural]] achievements. The architect Sinan designed many mosques and other great [[building]]s in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished.\n\n[[Sufi]] orders which were so widespread in the [[Islam]]ic world and who had many followers who had actively participated in the conquest of the city came to settle in the capital. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times over 100 [[Zawiyya|Tekkes]] were active in the city alone. Many of these Tekkes survive to this day some in the form of mosques while others as museums such as the [[Jerrahi]] Tekke in [[Fatih]], the [[Sunbul Effendi]] and Ramazan Effendi [[Mosque]] and [[Turbes]] also in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihane in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Effendi Tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi]] Tekke in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[Cem Evi]].\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n\nAs the years passed the population increased, from about 80,000 at the death of Mehmet, to 300,000 by the 18th century, and 400,000 in 1800. The capital of an empire that stretched across Europe, Asia and Africa, it also became an important diplomatic centre, with several foreign embassies.  It was only after 1922, following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|war between Greece and Turkey]] that things really began to change. With the establishment of the new Turkish Republic, built on a wave of nationalism, there was a mass exodus of much of the Greek and Armenian population from Istanbul, which had ceased to be the capital. After [[Istanbul pogrom|riots in 1955]] the remaining fraction also departed.\n\nThe city was modernized from the 1870s onwards with the building of bridges, the creation of a proper water system, the use of electric lights, and the introduction of [[trams]] and [[telephones]].\n{{wide image|Constantinople-Photo-Panoramic view2.png|1000px|Panoramic view of the city in the 1870s as seen from [[Galata Tower]]}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Constantinople partie du cot\u00e9 de Stamboul - 4000006193.jpg|Stamboul, around 1896\nFile:(Street in Ey\u00fcp, a section of Constantinople, Turkey) (LOC) (4210466213).jpg|A street in Ey\u00fcp in 1890s\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldGalatasaray1.jpg|Old Galatasaray -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldBeyoglu.jpg|Beyo\u011flu (Pera) -->\nImage:Tophane Place Istanbul.jpg|Tophane in 1890s\n</gallery>\n\n== Republic of Turkey ==\n{{Main|Istanbul}}\n[[File:Ethno religious groups Istanbul.png|thumbnail|300px|Ethno-religious groups in Istanbul (1896-1965).

The international name ''Constantinople'' also remained in use until Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name in their languages and their postal service networks. In 1929 [[Lloyd's]] agents were informed that telegrams now must be addressed to \"Istanbul\" or \"Stamboul\", but ''[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]'' stated that mail could still be delivered to \"Constantinople\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Telegraphic Name For Constantinople.|work=[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]|date=1929-11-25|page=12|issue=45369}}</ref> However ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that year that mail to \"Constantinople\" may no longer be delivered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/15/archives/topics-of-the-times.html|title=Topics of the Times: The Passing of Constantinople|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1929-11-15|page=19}}</ref> In 1929 Turkish Nationalists advocated for the usage of Istanbul in English instead of Constantinople.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"ISTANBUL\": The Correct Way of Writing Constantinople|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-15|page=11}}, also mentioned in {{cite news|title=MISCELLANY: The Name-Changers|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-16|page=11}}</ref> The [[U.S. State Department]] began using \"Istanbul\" in May 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/05/28/archives/washington-accepts-istanbul-as-replacing-constantinople.html|title=Washington Accepts \"Istanbul\" As Replacing \"Constantinople\"|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1930-05-28|accessdate=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favour of Ankara, the new capital. However, starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares (such as [[Taksim Square]]), boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city; sometimes at the expense of the demolition of many historical buildings.\n\nIn September 1955, many [[ethnic Greek]] businesses were destroyed during the [[Istanbul pogrom]]. This accelerated the departure of Greeks from the city and from Turkey. Jews, Armenians, and [[Georgian people|Georgian]]s were also targeted.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, the population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase, as people from [[Anatolia]] migrated to the city in order to find employment in the many new factories that were constructed at the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing development, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the greater metropolitan area of Istanbul.\n\nIn 2013, [[Taksim Square]] was the center of the [[Gezi Park protests]], where protesters protested a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secularism]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of Istanbul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{sisterlinks|Istanbul}}\n* Boyar, Ebru; Fleet, Kate.

Constantinople was the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which ended with the [[fall of Constantinople|Muslim conquest]] in 1453.  Constantinople then became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPopulation had declined during the medieval period, but as the Ottoman Empire approached its historical peak, the city grew to a population of close to 700,000 in the 16th century, once again ranking among the world's most populous cities.

According to historians this flourishing Eastern Roman Empire was then classified as the Byzantine Empire to distinguish it from the Roman Empire.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 272</ref> This empire was distinctly Greek in culture, and became the centre of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]] after an earlier [[East-West Schism|split]] with Rome, and was adorned with many magnificent [[Church (building)|churches]], including [[Hagia Sophia]], once the world's largest [[cathedral]]. The seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], remains. \n\nThe most famous Byzantine emperor was [[Justinian]] (527-565). During his reign he extended the Byzantine Empire to its largest boundaries spreading from Palestine to the tip of Spain. His other achievements include the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] church and the organized law system called the [[Codex]] which was completed in 534.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 273\u2013276</ref> However, Justinian's reign was the greatest influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nStarting in the 600's, warfare kept Constantinople's power flip-flopping between decline and progression. Alliance with Europe slowly began to break away from the Byzantine Empire between the seventh-eighth centuries, when the Byzantine and Roman churches disagreed on various subjects. However, the distinguishing gap placed between the two churches involved the use of icons in the church. Icons, being images of Christian holy people such as [[Jesus Christ]], the Virgin Mary and the saints, to Byzantine Christians were more than representations; they were believed to possess holy power that affected people's daily lives<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 291</ref> While many Byzantines worshiped icons many opposed the icons because they tested the authorities of the emperor. Finally in 726, Emperor Leo III (ruled, 717-741) ordered all icons to be destroyed. The destruction of icons reorganized and reoriented the Byzantine rulers in imperial power.<ref>Hunt, Lynn.

Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 292</ref> The fierce opposition to icons clashed with the pope's tolerance of images. The papacy was unwilling to permit sacred images and icons to be destroyed and this caused eventual separation.<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. pp. 313\u2013314</ref> Their separation caused hatred between the two churches and cooperation between the two was a struggle.\n\nFrom around the 9th to 13th centuries, Constantinople developed complex relationships with an emerging and later the largest and most advanced state of that time in [[Europe]] - [[Kiev Rus]]. Constantinople played a significant role in the [[Kiev Rus]] development, culture, and politics. Many of the Kiev Princes were married to daughters of the Byzantine Emperors, and because of this connection Eastern Europe became Orthodox, after it was Christianized by [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kiev]]. However these relationships were not always friendly - Constantinople was sacked several times over those 400 years by Kiev Princes, forcing Constantinople to sign increasingly favorable treaties for [[Kiev]], the texts of which were preserved in the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other historical documents (see [[Rus'-Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'-Byzantine War]]s).  Byzantine constantly played Kiev, Poland, Bulgaria, and other European Nations of that time, against each other.\n\nNear 1204, Constantinople began to decline in power. Because of the failure of the Third Crusade, self-confident western Europeans decided to again try to capture the Holy City of Jerusalem in the [[Fourth Crusade]]; but this time their plan was to capture the Byzantine Empire as well. In 1204, western armies captured Constantinople and ransacked the city for treasures.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\">Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed.

The crusaders chose Baldwin of Flanders to be the new Byzantine Emperor; he along with other princes and the Venetians divided the Empire amongst themselves; they never made it to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> This new [[Latin Empire]] at Constantinople lasted until 1261, when the Byzantines under the command of [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] recaptured the city and some outlying territory.<ref name=\"Hunt, Lynn 1500. p. 427\"/> After this, Constantinople never regained its former glory. Rather than a thriving metropolis, Constantinople transformed into a collection of villages, and became a semi-[[ghost town]] with, as [[Ibn Battuta]] noted, sown fields within the city walls. The city by 1453 held less than a tenth of its former population.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\nThe city, known alternatively in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as ''\u1e32os\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bn\u012bye'' ({{lang|ota|\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0647|rtl=yes}} after the Arabic form {{lang|ar-Latn|al-Qus\u1e6dan\u1e6d\u012bniyyah}} {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0637\u0646\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629|rtl=yes}}) or Istanbul (while its Christian minorities continued to name it Constantinople), was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from its conquest in 1453 until the empire's collapse in 1922.\n\n===Conquest===\n{{further|Fall of Constantinople}}\n\n[[File:Melchior Lorck - The Prospect of Constantinople (section).jpg|thumb|[[Melchior Lorck]] - The Prospect of Constantinople (16th century)]]\nOn 29 May 1453, [[Sultan Mehmed II]] \"the Conqueror\", entered [[Constantinople]] after a 53\u2013day [[siege]] during which his cannon had torn a huge hole in the [[Walls of Constantinople|Walls of Theodosius II]]. The city became the third capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nMehmed had begun the siege on 6 April 1453. He had hired engineers to build [[cannons]] and bombs for the occasion. He also acquired scholars and imams to encourage the soldiers. In accordance with [[Shariah]] (Muslim Holy Law), Mehmed gave the Byzantine emperor Constantine Palaeologus (1449\u20131453) three chances to surrender the city.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/> He guaranteed the safety of the city's residents, with their riches, beliefs and honor. Constantine valiantly refused the offer.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2012-05-31). p. 6</ref>\nAfter more than a month of fighting, Mehmed's advisors were beginning to lose hope. Against their counsel, Mehmed continued to fight. The night before the final assault, he studied previous attempts to take the city to distinguish potentially successful approaches. On the morning of 29 May 1453 the sultan ordered  [[Adzan]] (the call to prayer).<ref name=\"Eversley, Lord 1914. p. 2\">Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288 to 1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig.

The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response the Papacy sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. The Ottoman ships burnt the Byzantine ones in a naval battle.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). p. 7</ref>\n\n<!-- {{wide image||1000px|Panoramic view of the [[Golden Horn]] in Istanbul, as seen from the [[Galata Tower]].

This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.<ref>Hatzopoulos, Dionysios. \"The Fall of Constantinople.\" http://www.greece.org/Romiosini/fall.html (accessed 2/10/08). pp. 4\u201310</ref>\n\nFinally, Constantinople was under Ottoman rule. Mehmed entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]]. He immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]] which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: \"I testify that there is no God but [[Allah]]. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.\"<ref>Lewis, Bernard. Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6</ref> He turned the Orthodox cathedral into a Turkish [[mosque]], solidifying Turkish rule in Constantinople.\nMehmed ordered the city to be plundered for three days; during this time, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of casualties, rapes and forced deportations.<ref>Mansel, Philip (1995). Constantinople: City of the World's Desire. Hachette UK. p. 79. {{ISBN|0-7195-5076-9}}.</ref>\nFollowing the sack, Mehmed's main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city's defenses and re-population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249</ref> Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be deported to Constantinople by September.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969 p. 236\">Inalcik, Halil. \"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229-249. p. 236</ref>\n\n===Imperial capital===\nBy 1459, the Sultan dedicated a lot of energy to bringing prosperity to Constantinople. In several quarters of the city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque<ref>Hunt, Lynn. The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures. 2nd ed. A, To 1500. Mary Dougherty and Denise B. Wydra. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2005. p. 330</ref>), a public kitchen, and a mosque.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/> In the same year Mehmed sent out orders that any Greeks who had left Constantinople as slaves or refugees should be allowed to return. These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, now of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Inalcik, Halil 1969\"/>\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign over the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566 was a period of great artistic and architectural achievements. The famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] designed many mosques and other grand buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished. Many [[Zawiyya|tekkes]] survive to this day; some in the form of mosques while others have become museums such as the [[Jerrahi|Cerrahi]] Tekke and the [[S\u00fcnb\u00fcl Efendi]] and Ramazan Efendi mosques and [[t\u00fcrbe]]s in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihanesi in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Efendi tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi|Bekta\u015fi]] Tekke in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[cemevi]].\n\n{{wide image|Bosphorus Istanbul 2007.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the historic peninsula of Istanbul, looking westwards from the southern entrance of the [[Bosporus|Bosporus Strait]] at the [[Sea of Marmara]].

For [[Mehmet II]], conquest was only the first stage; the second was giving the old city an entirely new cosmopolitan social structure. Most of what remained of the Byzantine population - a mere 30,000 persons - was deported. According to the Ashikpashazade, a Turkish chronicle,\n\n<blockquote>\nMehmet then sent officers to all his lands to announce that whoever wished should come and take possession in Constantinople, as freehold, of houses and orchards and gardens ... Despite this measure the city was not repopulated. So then the Sultan commanded that from every land families, rich and poor alike, should be brought in by force ... and now the city began to be populous.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Europe's Muslim Capital |last=Mansel |first=Philip |work=History Today |volume=53 |issue=6 |date=July 2003 |url= http://www.historytoday.com/philip-mansel/europes-muslim-capital }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 1.jpg|thumb|View of Constantinople, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]\nMehmet took much personal interest in the creation of his new capital. On his orders the great mosque and the college of Fatih were built on the old burial grounds of the Byzantine Emperors at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]]. Bit by bit the great Christian city was transformed into a great Muslim city. Even so, the city was not to be entirely Muslim, at least not until the late 20th century. [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Armenians]], all of whose diverse skills were needed, were allowed to settle in a city which was to become known as ''alem penah''-refuge of the universe. According to the census of 1477, there were 9,486 houses occupied by Muslims; 3,743 by Greeks; 1,647 by Jews; 267 by Christians from the Crimea, and 31 Gypsies. Mehmet also re-established Constantinople, as it was still called at that time, as the center of the Orthodox patriarchate. [[File:View of the Seraglio Point from Pera.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Seraglio Point]] from [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], with the [[Bosphorus]] at left, the entrance of the [[Golden Horn]] at right, and the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Princes' Islands]] on the horizon]]\n\nThere was also an Italian community in the area of the [[Galata Tower]]. Having surrendered before the fall of the city, Mehmet allowed them to preserve an element of self-government. For generations after, they supplied interpreters and diplomats for the Ottoman Court. After the conquest of Egypt in 1517, and the Sultan's acceptance of the position of Caliph, Constantinople acquired an additional importance in Muslim eyes. Mosques built by [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] and his successors gave the city the unique appearance it still preserves today. The individual communities, though, still lived in self-contained areas, and had little in the way of social interaction, a source of future trouble.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, living standards were at least equal to most of Europe. For example, the development of urban craftsmen's wages was on a level similar to southern and central Europe during the sixteenth to eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] (1455) and [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] (1459) were erected in the years following the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]ish conquest. Religious foundations were endowed to fund the building of mosques such as the [[Fatih Mosque|Fatih]] (1463) and their associated [[school]]s and [[public bath]]s. The city had to be repopulated by a mixture of force and encouragement.\n\n[[File:Istanbul by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|''Kostantiniyye'' from the \"Book of Navigation\" by  [[Piri Reis]], ca. 1525]]\n\nS\u00fcleyman's reign was a time of great [[artistic]] and [[architectural]] achievements. The architect Sinan designed many mosques and other great [[building]]s in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[calligraphy]] also flourished.\n\n[[Sufi]] orders which were so widespread in the [[Islam]]ic world and who had many followers who had actively participated in the conquest of the city came to settle in the capital. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times over 100 [[Zawiyya|Tekkes]] were active in the city alone. Many of these Tekkes survive to this day some in the form of mosques while others as museums such as the [[Jerrahi]] Tekke in [[Fatih]], the [[Sunbul Effendi]] and Ramazan Effendi [[Mosque]] and [[Turbes]] also in [[Fatih]], the Galata Mevlevihane in [[Beyo\u011flu]], the Yahya Effendi Tekke in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], and the [[Bektashi]] Tekke in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], which now serves [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] as a [[Cem Evi]].\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n\nAs the years passed the population increased, from about 80,000 at the death of Mehmet, to 300,000 by the 18th century, and 400,000 in 1800. The capital of an empire that stretched across Europe, Asia and Africa, it also became an important diplomatic centre, with several foreign embassies.  It was only after 1922, following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|war between Greece and Turkey]] that things really began to change. With the establishment of the new Turkish Republic, built on a wave of nationalism, there was a mass exodus of much of the Greek and Armenian population from Istanbul, which had ceased to be the capital. After [[Istanbul pogrom|riots in 1955]] the remaining fraction also departed.\n\nThe city was modernized from the 1870s onwards with the building of bridges, the creation of a proper water system, the use of electric lights, and the introduction of [[trams]] and [[telephones]].\n{{wide image|Constantinople-Photo-Panoramic view2.png|1000px|Panoramic view of the city in the 1870s as seen from [[Galata Tower]]}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Constantinople partie du cot\u00e9 de Stamboul - 4000006193.jpg|Stamboul, around 1896\nFile:(Street in Ey\u00fcp, a section of Constantinople, Turkey) (LOC) (4210466213).jpg|A street in Ey\u00fcp in 1890s\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldGalatasaray1.jpg|Old Galatasaray -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:OldBeyoglu.jpg|Beyo\u011flu (Pera) -->\nImage:Tophane Place Istanbul.jpg|Tophane in 1890s\n</gallery>\n\n== Republic of Turkey ==\n{{Main|Istanbul}}\n[[File:Ethno religious groups Istanbul.png|thumbnail|300px|Ethno-religious groups in Istanbul (1896-1965).

The international name ''Constantinople'' also remained in use until Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name in their languages and their postal service networks. In 1929 [[Lloyd's]] agents were informed that telegrams now must be addressed to \"Istanbul\" or \"Stamboul\", but ''[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]'' stated that mail could still be delivered to \"Constantinople\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Telegraphic Name For Constantinople.|work=[[The Times (London, England)|The Times]]|date=1929-11-25|page=12|issue=45369}}</ref> However ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that year that mail to \"Constantinople\" may no longer be delivered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/15/archives/topics-of-the-times.html|title=Topics of the Times: The Passing of Constantinople|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1929-11-15|page=19}}</ref> In 1929 Turkish Nationalists advocated for the usage of Istanbul in English instead of Constantinople.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"ISTANBUL\": The Correct Way of Writing Constantinople|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-15|page=11}}, also mentioned in {{cite news|title=MISCELLANY: The Name-Changers|work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|date=1929-11-16|page=11}}</ref> The [[U.S. State Department]] began using \"Istanbul\" in May 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/05/28/archives/washington-accepts-istanbul-as-replacing-constantinople.html|title=Washington Accepts \"Istanbul\" As Replacing \"Constantinople\"|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1930-05-28|accessdate=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favour of Ankara, the new capital. However, starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares (such as [[Taksim Square]]), boulevards and avenues were constructed throughout the city; sometimes at the expense of the demolition of many historical buildings.\n\nIn September 1955, many [[ethnic Greek]] businesses were destroyed during the [[Istanbul pogrom]]. This accelerated the departure of Greeks from the city and from Turkey. Jews, Armenians, and [[Georgian people|Georgian]]s were also targeted.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, the population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase, as people from [[Anatolia]] migrated to the city in order to find employment in the many new factories that were constructed at the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing development, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the greater metropolitan area of Istanbul.\n\nIn 2013, [[Taksim Square]] was the center of the [[Gezi Park protests]], where protesters protested a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secularism]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timeline of Istanbul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{sisterlinks|Istanbul}}\n* Boyar, Ebru; Fleet, Kate.

Preclinical usage of epigenetic agents like [[5-azacytidine]] ([[DNMT]] inhibitor) and [[romidepsin]] (HDAC inhibitor) sensitizes cancer cells for further treatment. Some examples of clinical trials performed are listed below. \n\n==== Colorectal cancer ====\n\nEpigenetic treatment with [[5-azacytidine]] (5-AZA) and [[romidepsin]] before [[pembrolizumab]] administration was tested for safety in a [[clinical trial]] from 2016 - 2018. Drug administration ([[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]], [[romidepsin]], [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] + [[romidepsin]]) was followed for 14 days in 24 patients between 40\u201369 years old. Side effects in groups included [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and [[fatigue]]. Moreover, [[lack of appetite]], [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] were independent of the drug combination received by the patient. After this study, epigenetic agent 'pretherapy' with [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] and [[romidepsin]] followed by [[pembrolizumab]] treatment was deemed feasible and overall safe for patients.<ref>Murphy, A. G., Walker, R., Lutz, E. R., Parkinson, R., Ahuja, N., Zheng, L., ... & Azad, N. S. (2019). Epigenetic priming prior to [[pembrolizumab]] in [[mismatch repair]]-proficient advanced [[colorectal cancer]]</ref>\n\n==== Gastric carcinomas ====\nGastric cancer is heavily influenced by epigenetic aberrations. Analysis showed that DNA methylation changes have a higher influence on gastric cancer than point mutations. A phase I study on [[gastric cancer]] 5-AZA pretreatment in combination with [[epirubicin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[capecitabine]] was successful.<ref>Schneider, B. J., Shah, M. A., Klute, K., Ocean, A., Popa, E., Altorki, N., ... & Palmer, R. (2017).

Patients were treated two weeks before the immunotherapy either with 1 hour infusion (group A) or continuous infusion for 3, or 7 days (group B). Group B showed higher levels of hypomethylation after treatment than group A, but neither showed toxicity by the epigenetic agent. Finally, no significant side effects were encountered.<ref>Scandura, J. M., Roboz, G. J., Moh, M., Morawa, E., Brenet, F., Bose, J. R., ... & Curcio, T. J. (2011).

Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology, 118(6), 1472-1480.</ref>\n\nOlder patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]] diagnosis have poor [[prognosis]], lower rates of [[complete remission]] and worsening of overall survival. A phase 2 study was performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of epigenetic priming through [[decitabine]] in elderly patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]]. In 2015, 46 patients who were not candidates for intensive [[chemotherapy]] enrolled in the study. Treatment consisted of continuous [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] administration of [[decitabine]], followed by 5 days of [[cytarabine]] [[immunotherapy]]. Patients continued with a second cycle, if evidence of disease was found on 15 day [[bone marrow biopsy]], otherwise they proceeded with [[decitabine]] maintenance. The study showed that pretreatment with [[decitabine]] followed by [[cytarabine]] promoted higher number of [[complete remission]]s (70%) in older patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]].<ref>Im, A., Agha, M., Raptis, A., Hou, J. Z., Farah, R., Lim, S. H., ... & Fukas, L. (2015).

This idea is supported by various pieces of evidence. Firstly, despite [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] during [[Memory|memory formation]], memories may be retrieved later on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=T.

In contrast to DNA mutations which cannot be easily changed through treatment, these aberrant epigenetic changes allow for a reversible treatment avenue.\n\nEpigenetic agents have proved to increase expression of aberrantly silenced genes (i.e. [[RUNX3|Runx3]], [[TNF receptor superfamily|Tnf]], [[PYCARD|Pycard]], [[Fas receptor|Fas]]) in mice models after 5-aza-CR treatment .<ref name=\"Carter, C.

Preclinical usage of epigenetic agents like [[5-azacytidine]] ([[DNMT]] inhibitor) and [[romidepsin]] (HDAC inhibitor) sensitizes cancer cells for further treatment. Some examples of clinical trials performed are listed below. \n\n==== Colorectal cancer ====\n\nEpigenetic treatment with [[5-azacytidine]] (5-AZA) and [[romidepsin]] before [[pembrolizumab]] administration was tested for safety in a [[clinical trial]] from 2016 - 2018. Drug administration ([[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]], [[romidepsin]], [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] + [[romidepsin]]) was followed for 14 days in 24 patients between 40\u201369 years old. Side effects in groups included [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and [[fatigue]]. Moreover, [[lack of appetite]], [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] were independent of the drug combination received by the patient. After this study, epigenetic agent 'pretherapy' with [[5-azacytidine|5-AZA]] and [[romidepsin]] followed by [[pembrolizumab]] treatment was deemed feasible and overall safe for patients.<ref>Murphy, A. G., Walker, R., Lutz, E. R., Parkinson, R., Ahuja, N., Zheng, L., ... & Azad, N. S. (2019). Epigenetic priming prior to [[pembrolizumab]] in [[mismatch repair]]-proficient advanced [[colorectal cancer]]</ref>\n\n==== Gastric carcinomas ====\nGastric cancer is heavily influenced by epigenetic aberrations. Analysis showed that DNA methylation changes have a higher influence on gastric cancer than point mutations. A phase I study on [[gastric cancer]] 5-AZA pretreatment in combination with [[epirubicin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[capecitabine]] was successful.<ref>Schneider, B. J., Shah, M. A., Klute, K., Ocean, A., Popa, E., Altorki, N., ... & Palmer, R. (2017).

Patients were treated two weeks before the immunotherapy either with 1 hour infusion (group A) or continuous infusion for 3, or 7 days (group B). Group B showed higher levels of hypomethylation after treatment than group A, but neither showed toxicity by the epigenetic agent. Finally, no significant side effects were encountered.<ref>Scandura, J. M., Roboz, G. J., Moh, M., Morawa, E., Brenet, F., Bose, J. R., ... & Curcio, T. J. (2011). Phase 1 study of epigenetic priming with decitabine prior to standard induction chemotherapy for patients with AML. Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology, 118(6), 1472-1480.</ref>\n\nOlder patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]] diagnosis have poor [[prognosis]], lower rates of [[complete remission]] and worsening of overall survival. A phase 2 study was performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of epigenetic priming through [[decitabine]] in elderly patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]]. In 2015, 46 patients who were not candidates for intensive [[chemotherapy]] enrolled in the study. Treatment consisted of continuous [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] administration of [[decitabine]], followed by 5 days of [[cytarabine]] [[immunotherapy]]. Patients continued with a second cycle, if evidence of disease was found on 15 day [[bone marrow biopsy]], otherwise they proceeded with [[decitabine]] maintenance. The study showed that pretreatment with [[decitabine]] followed by [[cytarabine]] promoted higher number of [[complete remission]]s (70%) in older patients with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]].<ref>Im, A., Agha, M., Raptis, A., Hou, J. Z., Farah, R., Lim, S. H., ... & Fukas, L. (2015).
