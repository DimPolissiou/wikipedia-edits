{"title_page": "Spacetime", "text_new": "{{short description|Mathematical model combining space and time}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}\nIn [[physics]], '''spacetime''' is any [[mathematical model]] which fuses the [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one [[dimension]] of [[time]] into a single [[four-dimensional]] [[manifold]]. [[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagrams]] can be used to visualize [[Special relativity|relativistic]] effects, such as why different observers perceive where and when events occur differently.\n\nUntil the 20th century, it was assumed that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its spatial expression in terms of coordinates, distances, and directions) was independent of one-dimensional time. However, in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] based [[wikisource:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|a work on special relativity]] on two postulates:\n\n* The laws of physics are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (i.e., identical) in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]] (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference)\n* The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe logical consequence of taking these postulates together is the inseparable joining together of the four dimensions\u2014hitherto assumed as independent\u2014of space and time. Many counterintuitive consequences emerge: in addition to being independent of the motion of the light source, the speed of light has the same speed regardless of the frame of reference in which it is measured; the distances and even temporal ordering of pairs of events change when measured in different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] (this is the [[relativity of simultaneity]]); and the linear additivity of velocities no longer holds true.\n\nEinstein framed his theory in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). His theory was an advance over [[History of special relativity#Lorentz's 1904 model|Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena]] and [[History of special relativity#Poincar\u00e9's dynamics of the electron|Poincar\u00e9's electrodynamic theory]]. Although these theories included equations identical to those that Einstein introduced (i.e., the [[Lorentz transformation]]), they were essentially ad&nbsp;hoc models proposed to explain the results of various experiments\u2014including the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|Michelson\u2013Morley interferometer experiment]]\u2014that were extremely difficult to fit into existing paradigms.\n\nIn 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]]\u2014once one of the math professors of a young Einstein in Z\u00fcrich\u2014presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions of space into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as [[Minkowski space]]. A key feature of this interpretation is the formal definition of the spacetime interval. Although measurements of distance and time between [[Event (relativity)|events]] differ for measurements made in different reference frames, the spacetime interval is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which they are recorded.\n\nMinkowski's geometric interpretation of relativity was to prove vital to Einstein's development of his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], wherein he showed how [[stress\u2013energy tensor|mass and energy]] [[Riemann curvature tensor|curve]] flat spacetime into a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].\n\n{{anchor|Contents}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Introduction}}\n{{anchor|Definitions}}\n\n=== Definitions ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

[[General relativity]] also provides an explanation of how [[gravitational fields]] can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.\n\nIn ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as [[dimension#In physics|dimensions]]. In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], these are called x, y, and z. A position in spacetime is called an ''event'', and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig.&nbsp;1). Spacetime is thus [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensional]]. An event is something that happens instantaneously at a single point in spacetime, represented by a set of coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''t''.\n\nThe word \"event\" used in relativity should not be confused with the use of the word \"event\" in normal conversation, where it might refer to an \"event\" as something such as a concert, sporting event, or a battle. These are not mathematical \"events\" in the way the word is used in relativity, because they have finite durations and extents. Unlike the analogies used to explain events, such as firecrackers or lightning bolts, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime.\n\nThe path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a succession of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a line which represents a particle's progress through spacetime. That line is called the particle's ''world line''.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nMathematically, spacetime is a ''[[manifold]]'', which is to say, it appears locally \"flat\" near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, a globe appears flat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowland |first1=Todd |title=Manifold |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Manifold.html |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> An extremely large scale factor, <math>c</math> (conventionally called the ''speed-of-light'') relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time.

It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]], that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=A.P.|title=Special Relativity|date=1968|publisher=CRC Press|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0748764224|pages=35\u201360}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1-1}}\n[[File:Observer in special relativity.svg|thumb|Figure 1-1.

This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location. In Fig.&nbsp;1&#8209;1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term ''observer'' refers to the entire ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetime_physics/|title=Spacetime Physics: Introduction to Special Relativity|last1=Taylor|first1=Edwin F.|last2=Wheeler|first2=John Archibald|date=1992|publisher=Freeman|isbn=071670336X|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|pages=|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|17\u201322}} In this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer, however, will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the [[data reduction]] following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.\n\nIn many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word \"observer\" is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.\n\nPhysicists distinguish between what one ''measures'' or ''observes'' (after one has factored out signal propagation delays), versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failure to understand [[Special relativity#Measurement versus visual appearance|the difference between what one measures/observes versus what one sees]] is the source of much error among beginning students of relativity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=Rachel E.|last2=Shaffer|first2=Peter S.|last3=Vokos|first3=Stamatis|title=Student understanding of time in special relativity: Simultaneity and reference frames|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=July 2001|volume=69|issue=S1|pages=S24\u2013S35|doi=10.1119/1.1371254|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0207/0207109.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2017|bibcode = 2001AmJPh..69S..24S |arxiv=physics/0207109}}</ref>\nIn short: Spacetime is cool.\n\n=== History ===\n{{anchor|History}}\n{{main | History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n | image1            = Michelson-Morley experiment conducted with white light.png\n <!-- | caption1          = -->\n | image2            = MichelsonMorleyAnimationDE.gif\n | caption2          = Figure 1-2.

For example, the [[Fizeau experiment]] of 1851 demonstrated that the speed of light in flowing water was less than the sum of the speed of light in air plus the speed of the water by an amount dependent on the water's index of refraction. Among other issues, the dependence of the partial [[aether-dragging]] implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether ''simultaneously'' flows at different speeds for different colors of light.<ref name=Stachel>{{cite book |last=Stachel |first=John |editor1-last=Kox |editor1-first=A.

(No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.)\n\nBy 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein were to derive later (i.e. the [[Lorentz transform]]), but with a fundamentally different interpretation. As a theory of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter.<ref name=\"Pais\">{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=\"\"Subtle is the Lord-- \": The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019853907X|edition=11th|url=https://archive.org/details/subtleislordscie00pais}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013174}} Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called ''local time'', with which he could explain the [[aberration of light]], the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.

However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital, and in 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity.<ref name=\"Pais\"/>{{rp|151\u2013152}} Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as ''Minkowski spacetime.''\n\n== Spacetime in special relativity ==\n{{anchor|Spacetime interval}} <!-- This section is linked from [[Lorentz transformation]] -->\n\n=== Spacetime interval ===\nIn three-dimensions, the ''distance'' <math>\\Delta{d}</math> between two points can be defined using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\Delta{d}\\right)}^2 = {\\left(\\Delta{x}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{y}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{z}\\right)}^2</math>\nAlthough two viewers may measure the x,y, and z position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both (assuming that they are measuring using the same units). The distance is \"invariant\".\n\nIn special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers when one of the observers is moving, because of [[Lorentz contraction]].  The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because (from their point of view) they are stationary, and the position of the event is receding or approaching.  Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective \"distance\" between two events.\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the ''interval''.  Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]]. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two ''[[event (relativity)|events]]'' (because of [[time dilation]]) or the distance between the two events (because of [[length contraction]]). But special relativity provides a new invariant, called the ''spacetime interval'', which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure time and distance carefully will find the same spacetime interval between any two events. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by <math>\\Delta t</math> and a spatial distance <math>\\Delta x</math>. Then the spacetime interval <math>{\\left(\\Delta{s}\\right)}^2</math> between the two events that are separated by a distance <math>\\Delta{x}</math> in space and by <math>\\Delta{ct}= c\\Delta t</math> in the <math>ct</math>-coordinate is:\n\n:<math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 </math>, or for three space dimensions, <math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2</math><ref>{{cite book |title=Differential Manifolds and Theoretical Physics |first1=W.

The spacetime interval is the quantity <math>s^2</math>, not <math>s</math> itself. The reason is that unlike distances in Euclidean geometry, intervals in Minkowski spacetime can be negative.

In other words, the spacetime interval between two events on the world line of something moving at the speed of light is zero. Such an interval is termed ''lightlike'' or ''null''. A photon arriving in our eye from a distant star will not have aged, despite having (from our perspective) spent years in its passage.\n\nA spacetime diagram is typically drawn with only a single space and a single time coordinate. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;1 presents a spacetime diagram illustrating the ''[[world lines]]'' (i.e. paths in spacetime) of two photons, A and B, originating from the same event and going in opposite directions. In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by <math>\\textrm{c}</math> so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of \u00b11. In other words, every meter that a photon travels to the left or right requires approximately 3.3 nanoseconds of time.\n\n'''Note on nomenclature:''' There are two sign conventions in use in the relativity literature:\n: <math>s^2 = (\\textrm{c} t)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2</math>\n: and\n: <math>s^2 = - (\\textrm{c} t)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2</math>\n\nThese sign conventions are associated with the ''[[metric signature]]s'' {{nowrap|(+&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212)}} and {{nowrap|(\u2212&thinsp;+&thinsp;+&thinsp;+).}} A minor variation is to place the time coordinate last rather than first.

With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;2, two [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion.

Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b illustrates a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S\u2032 are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S and ''t''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S'. The ''ct''\u2032 axis passes through the events in frame S\u2032 which have ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. But the points with ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are moving in the ''x''-direction of frame S with velocity ''v'', so that they are not coincident with the ''ct'' axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the ''ct''\u2032 axis is tilted with respect to the ''ct'' axis by an angle ''\u03b8'' given by\n\n: <math>\\tan\\ \\theta = v/c .</math>\n\nThe ''x''\u2032 axis is also tilted with respect to the ''x'' axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always&nbsp;\u00b11. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O\u2032. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''a''. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance ''a'' from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'' (event R).\n\nThe same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b in the frame of observer O. The light paths have slopes&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;\u22121 so that \u25b3PQR forms a right triangle.

The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a [[Cartesian plane]], and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.\n\n{{anchor|Light cone}}\n\n=== Light cone ===\n{{main|light cone}}\n{{anchor|Figure 2-4}}\n[[File:ModernPhysicsSpaceTimeA.png|thumb|Figure 2-4. The light cone centered on an event divides the rest of spacetime into the future, the past, and \"elsewhere\"]]\nIn Fig. 2-4, event&nbsp;O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the ''light cone'' of the event&nbsp;O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;5) makes the appearance that of two [[cone|right circular cones]] meeting with their apices at&nbsp;O. One cone extends into the future (t>0), the other into the past (t<0).\n\n[[File:World line.png|thumb|Figure 2-5. Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension]]\nA light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more ''time'' (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their ''spatial distance'' at lightspeed; these events comprise the ''timelike future'' of the event&nbsp;O. Likewise, the ''timelike past'' comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in ''timelike intervals'' &Delta;''ct'' is greater than &Delta;''x'', making timelike intervals positive. The region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event&nbsp;O by more ''space'' than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given ''time''. These events comprise the so-called ''spacelike'' region of the event&nbsp;O, denoted  \"Elsewhere\" in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be ''lightlike'' (or ''null separated'') from&nbsp;O.  Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220}}\n\nThe light cone has an essential role within the concept of [[causality]]. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of&nbsp;O to the position and time of D (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4). It is hence possible for event&nbsp;O to have a causal influence on event&nbsp;D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.&nbsp;B or&nbsp;C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event&nbsp;O, nor can they be affected by event&nbsp;O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event&nbsp;O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Erik|last2=Bokulich|first2=Peter|title=Lightcones and Causal Structure|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Relativity of simultaneity}}\n\n=== Relativity of simultaneity ===\n{{anchor|Figure 2-6}}\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity Animation.gif|thumb|Figure 2-6.

Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event's past light cone occurs ''before'' the given event. The before-after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. [[#Figure 2-4|'''Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4''']] was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at {{nowrap|1=''v'' = 0.}} From this reference frame, event&nbsp;C is observed to occur after event&nbsp;O, and event&nbsp;B is observed to occur before event&nbsp;O. From a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are ''necessarily'' separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame, is termed the [[relativity of simultaneity]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven|title=Being and Becoming in Modern Physics. 3.

Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24 meters ({{val|1.75|e=\u22128|u=s}}), while for a clock traveling at 0.7''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00 meters ({{val|2.34|e=\u22128|u=s}}). This illustrates the phenomenon known as [[time dilation]]. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x&ndash;axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220\u2013221}} The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual.

Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one's frame of reference. But events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are, in general, not simultaneous in other frames of reference.\n\nFig. 2-9 illustrates the motions of a 1&nbsp;m rod that is traveling at 0.5&nbsp;''c'' along the ''x'' axis.

The endpoints O and B measured when {{\u2032|''t''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are simultaneous events in the S\u2032 frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the ''x''-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's ''world sheet'' onto the ''x'' axis yields the foreshortened length OC.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n(not illustrated) Drawing a vertical line through A so that it intersects the ''x''' axis demonstrates that, even as OB is foreshortened from the point of view of observer O, OA is likewise foreshortened from the point of view of observer O\u2032. In the same way that each observer measures the other's clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other's rulers as being contracted.\n\nIn regards to mutual length contraction, [[#Figure 2-9|'''&nbsp;2&#8209;9''']] illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually [[Lorentz transformation#Coordinate transformation|rotated]] by a [[hyperbolic angle]] (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry).<ref group=note>In a [[Cartesian plane]], ordinary rotation leaves a circle unchanged.

If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S', as running slower than his', while S' is moving at speed ''v'' in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S' likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed \u2212''v'' in S', as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run ''both slower'' than the other, is an important question that \"goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.\"<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198}}\n\nBasically, this apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the ''only apparent'' contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W' (at rest in S'), one uses ''two'' additional, synchronized clocks W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance ''d''.\n:<small>Two events can be defined by the condition \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\", i.e., when W' passes each  W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. For both events the two readings of the collocated clocks are recorded. The difference of the two readings of W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> is the temporal distance of the two events in S, and their spatial distance is ''d''. The difference of the two readings of W' is the temporal distance of the two events in S'. In S' these events are only separated in time, they happen at the same place in S'. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval spanned by these two events, and the nonzero spatial separation ''d'' in S, the temporal distance in S' must be smaller than the one in S: the ''smaller'' temporal distance between the two events, resulting from the readings of the moving clock W', belongs to the ''slower'' running clock W'.</small>\n\nConversely, for judging in frame S' the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S'.\n:<small>In this comparison the clock W is moving by with velocity -''v''. Recording again the four readings for the events, defined by \"two clocks simultaneously at one place\", results in the analogous temporal distances of the two events, now temporally and spatially separated in S', and only temporally separated but collocated in S. To keep the spacetime interval invariant, the temporal distance in S must be smaller than in S', because of the spatial separation of the events in S': now clock W is observed to run slower.</small>\n\nObviously, the necessary recordings for the two judgements, with \"one moving clock\" and \"two clocks at rest\" in respectively S or S', involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally \"consistent\" such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the one's clock to be fast.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=250\n| image2 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation B.png  |width2=300|height2=300\n| image4 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation D.png  |width4=300|height4=300\n| footer = Figure 2-10. Mutual time dilation }}\nFig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S \"at rest\" with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S' \"moving with ''v'' > 0\", coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S' \"at rest\" with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S \"moving with \u2212''v'' < 0\", with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.\n\nEach line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (''x'', ''x\u2032'') represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (''ct'', ''ct\u2032''). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (''ct'', ''ct\u2032'') represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (''x'', ''x\u2032'').\n\n:<small>One may designate in both pictures the origin ''O'' (= ''O\u2032'') as the event, where the respective \"moving clock\" is collocated with the \"first clock at rest\" in both comparisons. Obviously, for this event the readings on both clocks in both comparisons are zero. As a consequence, the worldlines of the  moving clocks are the slanted to the right ''ct\u2032''-axis (upper pictures, clock W') and the slanted to the left ''ct''-axes (lower pictures, clock W). The worldlines of W<sub>1</sub> and W'<sub>1</sub> are the corresponding vertical time axes (''ct'' in the upper pictures, and ''ct\u2032'' in the lower pictures).</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the place for W<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''A''<sub>''x''</sub> > 0, and thus the worldline (not shown in the pictures) of this clock intersects the worldline of the moving clock (the ''ct\u2032''-axis)  in the event labelled ''A'', where \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\". In the lower picture the place for W'<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''C''<sub>''x\u2032''</sub> < 0, and so in this measurement the moving clock W passes W'<sub>2</sub> in the event ''C''.</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the ''ct''-coordinate ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> of the event ''A'' (the reading of W<sub>2</sub>) is labeled ''B'', thus giving the elapsed time between the two events, measured with W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>, as ''OB''. For a comparison, the length of the time interval ''OA'', measured with W', must be transformed to the scale of the ''ct''-axis. This is done by the invariant hyperbola (see also Fig. 2-8) through ''A'', connecting all events with the same spacetime interval from the origin as ''A''. This yields the event ''C'' on the ''ct''-axis, and obviously: ''OC'' < ''OB'', the \"moving\" clock W' runs slower.</small>\n\nTo show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event ''D'' may be constructed as the event at ''x\u2032'' = 0 (the location of clock W' in S'), that is simultaneous to ''C'' (''OC'' has equal spacetime interval as ''OA'') in S'. This shows that the time interval ''OD'' is longer than ''OA'', showing that the \"moving\" clock runs slower.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|124}}\n\nIn the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity -''v'' in the frame S' at rest. The worldline of clock W is the ''ct''-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W'<sub>1</sub> is the vertical ''ct\u2032''-axis, and the worldline of W'<sub>2</sub> is the vertical through event ''C'', with ''ct\u2032''-coordinate ''D''. The invariant hyperbola through event ''C'' scales the time interval ''OC'' to ''OA'', which is shorter than ''OD''; also, ''B'' is constructed (similar to ''D'' in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to ''A'' in S, at ''x'' = 0. The result ''OB'' > ''OC'' corresponds again to above.\n\nThe word \"measure\" is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object's state of motion ''can'' affect the observer's ''observations'' of the object.\n\n==== Twin paradox ====\nMany introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of \"paradoxes\". These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\">{{cite book|last1=Schutz|first1=Bernard F.|title=A first course in general relativity|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521277035|page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[twin paradox]] is a [[thought experiment]] involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|207}} Nevertheless, the ''twin paradox'' is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.\n\nThe impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/><ref group=note>Even with no (de)acceleration i.e. using one inertial frame O for constant, high-velocity outward journey and another inertial frame I for constant, high-velocity inward journey - the sum of the elapsed time in those frames (O and I) is shorter than the elapsed time in the stationary inertial frame S. Thus acceleration and deceleration is not the cause of shorter elapsed time during the outward and inward journey. Instead the use of two different constant, high-velocity inertial frames for outward and inward journey is really the cause of shorter elapsed time total. Granted, if the same twin has to travel outward and inward leg of the journey and safely switch from outward to inward leg of the journey, the acceleration and deceleration is required. If the travelling twin could ride the high-velocity outward inertial frame and instantaneously switch to high-velocity inward inertial frame the example would still work. The point is that real reason should be stated clearly. The asymmetry is because of the comparison of sum of elapsed times in two different inertial frames (O and I) to the elapsed time in a single inertial frame S.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Introductory Physics fig 4.9.png|thumb|Figure 2-11. Spacetime explanation of the twin paradox]]\nDeeper analysis is needed before we can understand why these distinctions should result in a difference in the twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the [[Line integral|path integral]]) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.<ref name=\"Weiss\">{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Michael |title=The Twin Paradox |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/TwinParadox/twin_paradox.html |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nComplications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin's point of view.\n\nFor the rest of this discussion, we adopt Weiss's nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nWe had previously noted that Stella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity. This is not true.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\n:<small>A pure SR analysis would be as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> [[#Figure 2-6|'''Figs.&nbsp;2&#8209;6''']] and 2&#8209;11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, ''from Stella's point of view'', are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. ''But during the turnaround'' (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift takes place in the angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, at the end of her trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/></small>\n\nAlthough general relativity is not ''required'' to analyze the twin paradox, application of the [[Equivalence Principle]] of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip.  When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of [[gravitational time dilation]], his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> As will be discussed in the forthcoming section [[#Curvature of time|'''Curvature of time''']], the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}}\n{{anchor|Gravitation}}\n\n=== Gravitation ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

Event&nbsp;P has coordinates (''w'',&nbsp;''x'') in the black \"rest system\" and coordinates {{math|1=({{\u2032|''w''}},&nbsp;{{\u2032|''x''}})}} in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c''}}. How do we determine {{\u2032|''w''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}} in terms of ''w'' and ''x''? (Or the other way around, of course.)\n\nIt is easier at first to derive the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation.\n#We start by noting that there can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. ''y{{'}}'' must equal ''y'' and {{\u2032|''z''}} must equal ''z'', otherwise whether a fast moving 1&nbsp;m ball could fit through a 1&nbsp;m circular hole would depend on the observer.

From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for {{\u2032|''t''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}}.\n\n==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====\nThe Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since ''x{{'}}'' and ''t{{'}}'' are obtained as linear combinations of ''x'' and ''t'', with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|67}} All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|72\u201373}} Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|190}}\n\nA result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.\n\n<small>'''Example:''' Terence observes Stella speeding away from him at 0.500&nbsp;c, and he can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.500}} to relate Stella's measurements to his own. Stella, in her frame, observes Ursula traveling away from her at 0.250&nbsp;c, and she can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.250}} to relate Ursula's measurements with her own. Because of the linearity of the transformations and the relativistic composition of velocities, Terence can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.666}} to relate Ursula's measurements with his own.</small>\n\n{{anchor|Doppler effect}}\n\n=== Doppler effect ===\n{{main|Doppler effect|Relativistic Doppler effect}}\n\nThe [[Doppler effect]] is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line ([[transverse Doppler effect]]). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.\n\n==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====\nThe classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of ''v<sub>s</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>s</sub>'', the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta _s}f_0</math>\n\nOn the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of ''v<sub>r</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>r</sub>'', the wavelength is ''not'' changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = (1-\\beta _r)f_0</math>\n\n[[File:Spacetime Diagram of Relativistic Doppler Effect.svg|thumb|Figure 3-6. Spacetime diagram of relativistic Doppler effect]]\nLight, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter ''&beta;'', so that the separation between source and receiver at time ''w'' is ''&beta;w''. Because of time dilation, {{tmath|1=W=Y W^{\\prime} }}. Since the slope of the green light ray is \u22121, {{tmath|1={T}=W+\\beta w=\\gamma w^{\\prime}(1+\\beta)}}.

Transverse Doppler effect scenarios]]\nSuppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:<ref name=\"Morin2008\">{{cite book |last1=Morin |first1=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87622-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocl00mori }}</ref>{{rp|541\u2013543}}\n{{plainlist|\n* Fig. 3-7a. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver is geometrically at its closest approach to the source? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S' of the source.<ref group=note>\nThe ease of analyzing a relativistic scenario often depends on the frame in which one chooses to perform the analysis. '''[[:File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 3.svg|In this linked image]],''' we present alternative views of the transverse Doppler shift scenario where source and receiver are at their closest approach to each other.\n\n(a) If we analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver, we find that the analysis is more complicated than it should be. The apparent position of a celestial object is displaced from its true position (or geometric position) because of the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer. The source would be time-dilated relative to the receiver, but the redshift implied by this time dilation would be offset by a blueshift due to the longitudinal component of the relative motion between the receiver and the apparent position of the source.\n\n(b) It is much easier if, instead, we analyze the scenario from the frame of the source. An observer situated at the source knows, from the problem statement, that the receiver is at its closest point to him. That means that the receiver has no longitudinal component of motion to complicate the analysis. Since the receiver's clocks are time-dilated relative to the source, the light that the receiver receives is therefore blue-shifted by a factor of ''gamma.''</ref>\n* Fig. 3-7b. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver ''sees'' the source as being closest to it? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S of the receiver.\n\nTwo other scenarios are commonly examined in discussions of transverse Doppler shift:\n* Fig. 3-7c. If the receiver is moving in a circle around the source, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n* Fig. 3-7d. If the source is moving in a circle around the receiver, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n}}<!--end plainlist-->\nIn scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time  (i.e. dr/dt&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency ''f{{'}}'', but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame&nbsp;S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by [[blueshifted]] light of frequency\n:<math>f = f' \\gamma = f' / \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nIn scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is [[redshifted]] with frequency\n:<math>f = f' / \\gamma = f' \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nScenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of <math>\\gamma</math>, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.)<ref name=\"Morin2008\"/>{{rp|541\u2013543}} Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).<ref group=note>Not all experiments characterize the effect in terms of a redshift. For example, the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment#Relativistic Doppler effect|K\u00fcndig experiment]] was set up to measure transverse blueshift using a M\u00f6ssbauer source setup at the center of a centrifuge rotor and an absorber at the rim.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Energy and momentum}}\n\n=== Energy and momentum ===\n{{main|Four-momentum|Momentum|Mass\u2013energy equivalence}}\n\n==== Extending momentum to four dimensions ====\n[[File:Relativistic spacetime momentum vector.svg|thumb|330px|Figure 3-8. Relativistic spacetime momentum vector]]\nIn classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. [[Linear momentum]], the product of a particle's mass and velocity, is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: {{math|1='''''p'''''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'''v'''''}}. It is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector {{tmath|(x,t)}}. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}, but the time component equals ''mc''.\n\nWe can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that {{tmath|1=(m c)^{\\prime}=y m c}} and {{tmath|1=p^{\\prime}=-\\beta y m c}}, since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches ''c''.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|84\u201387}}\n\nWe will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the [[four-momentum]].\n\n==== Momentum of light ====\n[[File:Calculating the energy of light in different inertial frames.svg|thumb|Figure 3-9. Energy and momentum of light in different inertial frames]]\nLight particles, or photons, travel at the speed of ''c'', the constant that is conventionally known as the ''speed of light''. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.\n\nA consequence of [[Maxwell's theory]] of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: {{tmath|1=E/p = c}}. Rearranging, {{tmath|1=E/c = p}}, and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, ''E/c'' must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.\n\nPhotons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in ''&gamma;mc'' must be zero, meaning that photons are [[massless particle]]s. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but ''E/c'' is well-defined.\n\nBy this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals ''E'' in the rest frame, it equals {{tmath|1=E^{\\prime}=(1-\\beta) \\gamma E }}in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|88}}\n\n==== Mass-energy relationship ====\nConsideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several famous conclusions.\n\n*In the low speed limit as {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v/c''}} approaches zero, {{mvar|&gamma;}} approaches 1, so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum {{tmath|1=\\beta y m c=y m v}} approaches ''mv'', the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective, ''&gamma;m'' can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of ''m''. Einstein proposed that the ''[[relativistic mass]]'' of an object increases with velocity according to the formula {{tmath|1=m_{r e l}=Y m}}.\n*Likewise, comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon, {{tmath|1=y m c=m_{r e l} c=E / c}}, so that Einstein arrived at the relationship {{tmath|1=E=m_{r e l} c^{2} }}. Simplified to the case of zero velocity, this is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass.\n\nAnother way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of {{math|1=''&gamma;mc''<sup>2</sup>}} at low velocity:\n: <math> E = \\gamma m c^2 =\\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta ^ 2}}</math> <math>\\approx m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 ...</math>\nThe second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|90\u201392}}<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\nThe concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, ''m<sub>rel</sub>'', although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=H.

Using an uppercase ''P'' to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase '''''p''''' to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as\n: <math>P \\equiv (E/c, \\vec{p}) = (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z)</math> or alternatively,\n: <math>P \\equiv (E, \\vec{p}) = (E, p_x, p_y, p_z) </math> using the convention that <math>c = 1 .</math><ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\n{{anchor|Conservation laws}}\n\n=== Conservation laws ===\n{{main|Conservation law}}\n\nIn physics, conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915, [[Emmy Noether]] discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Byers|first1=Nina|title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws|eprint=physics/9807044|year=1998}}</ref> The fact that physical processes don't care ''where'' in space they take place ([[space translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of momentum]], the fact that such processes don't care ''when'' they take place ([[time translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of energy]], and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.\n\n==== Total momentum ====\n[[File:Relativistic conservation of momentum.png|thumb|Figure 3-10. Relativistic conservation of momentum]]\nTo understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: \n:(1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision. \n:(2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. \nFor both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.\n\nIn case (2), two masses with momentums {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{1} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{1} } }} \nand {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{2} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{2} } }} collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }} traveling at the [[center of mass]] velocity of the original system, <math>\\boldsymbol{v_{c m}}=\\left(m_{1} \\boldsymbol{v_1}+m_{2} \\boldsymbol{v_2}\\right) /\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) </math>. The total momentum {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p=p_{1}+p_{2} } }} is conserved.\n\nFig.&nbsp;3&#8209;10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components {{tmath|E_{1} / c}} and {{tmath|E_{2} / c}} add up to total ''E/c'' of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{1} } }} and {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{2} } }} add up to form ''p'' of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: {{tmath|1=m>m_{1}+m_{2} }}.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|94\u201397}}\n\nLooking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable [[elementary particle]] spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\n==== Choice of reference frames ====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=2-body Particle Decay-Lab.svg|width1=115|image2=2-body Particle Decay-CoM.svg|width2=105|caption1=Figure 3-11. <br/>(above) '''Lab Frame'''.<br/>(right) '''Center of Momentum Frame'''.|&nbsp;}}\nThe freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the \"[[center-of-momentum frame]]\" (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.\n\n[[#Contents|''Return to Introduction'']]\n\n==== Energy and momentum conservation ====\nIn a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}}, the momentum {{tmath|1=p' = p - mu}}. If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nConservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }}. In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined&mdash;an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nNewtonian momenta, calculated as {{tmath|1=p = mv}}, fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}} is replaced by the highly nonlinear\n{{tmath|1=v^{\\prime}=(v-u) \\Big/\\left(1- \\frac{v u} { c^{2} }\\right)}} so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. As we have discussed in the previous section on [[#Four-momentum|'''four-momentum''']], this second option was what he chose.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|104}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Energy-momentum diagram for pion decay (A).png\n | width1            = <!-- displayed width of image; overridden by \"width\" above -->\n | alt1              = \n | caption1          = Figure 3-12a.

Mass is no longer conserved independently, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy.

Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally [[tensors]], greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are ''manifestly'' relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of [[Maxwell's equations]] in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation (really no more than an observation) using the [[field strength tensor]] formulation. On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities. Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors, capable of connecting such  {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}} even within a ''curved'' spacetime, and not just within a ''flat'' one as in special relativity. The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article, which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime.\n\n==== Definition of 4-vectors ====\nA 4-tuple, {{tmath|1=A=\\left(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\\right)}} is a \"4-vector\" if its component ''A<sub>&thinsp;i</sub>'' transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf using {{tmath|1=(ct, x, y, z)}} coordinates, ''A'' is a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} if it transforms (in the {{nowrap|1=''x''-direction}}) according to\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A_0' &= \\gamma \\left( A_0 - (v/c) A_1 \\right)  \\\\ \n  A_1' &= \\gamma \\left( A_1 - (v/c) A_0 \\right)\\\\\n  A_2' &= A_2 \\\\ \n  A_3' &= A_3\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich comes from simply replacing ''ct'' with ''A''<sub>0</sub> and ''x'' with ''A''<sub>1</sub> in the earlier presentation of the [[#Lorentz transformations|'''Lorentz transformation.''']]\n\nAs usual, when we write ''x'', ''t'', etc. we generally mean ''&Delta;x'', ''&Delta;t'' etc.\n\nThe last three components of a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space.

The rule is that two {{nowrap|1=4-vectors}} are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45\u00b0 line which is the world line of a light ray. This implies that a lightlike {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} is orthogonal with ''itself''.\n* '''Invariance of the magnitude of a vector:''' The magnitude of a vector is the inner product of a {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} with itself, and is a frame-independent property.

Note that a null vector is not the same as a zero vector. A null vector is one for which <math>A \\cdot A = 0 ,</math> while a zero vector is one whose components are all zero.

The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.<ref name=\"PhysicsFAQ\"/>\n\nIn this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.\n\n{{anchor|Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox}}\n\n==== Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ====\n{{main|Bell's spaceship paradox}}\n\nThe Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ([[Bell's spaceship paradox]]) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.\n\n[[File:Bell's spaceship paradox - two spaceships - initial setup.png|thumb|Figure 4-4. Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox]]\nIn Fig.&nbsp;4&#8209;4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string which is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration.<ref group=note>In relativity theory, proper acceleration is the physical acceleration (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a free-fall, or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured.</ref> Will the string break?\n\nThe [[Bell's spaceship paradox|main article for this section]] recounts how, when the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n# To observers in the rest frame, the spaceships start a distance ''L'' apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration. During acceleration, ''L'' is a length contracted distance of the distance {{nowrap|1=''L{{'}} = &gamma;L''}} in the frame of the accelerating spaceships. After a sufficiently long time, ''&gamma;'' will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break.\n# Let ''A'' and ''B'' be the rear and front spaceships. In the frame of the spaceships, each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing. ''A'' says that ''B'' has the same acceleration that he has, and ''B'' sees that ''A'' matches her every move. So the spaceships stay the same distance apart, and the string does not break.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\nThe problem with the first argument is that there is no \"frame of the spaceships.\" There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Bell observers experiment2.png|thumb|Figure 4-5.

Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. We say that the satellite always follows along the path of a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]]. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nIn any analysis of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of ''two'' bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational field of the Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with respect to each other do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the ''appearance'' of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nTwo central propositions underlie general relativity. \n* The first crucial concept is coordinate independence: The laws of physics cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension of the principle of relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames.

Einstein's argument suggesting gravitational redshift]]\nIn the discussion of special relativity, forces played no more than a background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate as the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a ''global'' inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, ''local'' inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nShortly after the publication of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following [[thought experiment]]: (i) Assume that a tower of height ''h'' (Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass ''m'' from the top of the tower. It falls freely with acceleration ''g'', reaching the ground with velocity {{math|1=''v'' = (2''gh'')<sup>1/2</sup>}}, so that its total energy ''E'', as measured by an observer on the ground, is {{tmath|1=m + \\frac{\\frac 1 2 m v^2} {c^2} = m + \\frac{m g h} {c^2} }} (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon ''E{{'}}'' back into a particle of rest mass ''m{{'}}''.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nIt must be that {{math|1=''m'' = ''m{{'}}''}}, since otherwise one would be able to construct a [[perpetual motion]] device. We therefore predict that {{math|1=''E{{'}}'' = ''m''}}, so that\n: <math>\\frac{E'}{E} = \\frac{h \\nu \\, '}{ h \\nu} = \\frac{m}{m + \\frac{mgh}{c^2}} = 1 - \\frac{gh}{c^2}</math>\n\nA photon climbing in Earth's gravitational field loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical observations were somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory observations were performed by [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment|Pound & Rebka (1959)]] and later by Pound & Snider (1964).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mester |first1=John |title=Experimental Tests of General Relativity |url=https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |publisher=Laboratoire Univers et Th\u00e9ories |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085505/https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLight has an associated frequency, and this frequency may be used to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive at the top of the tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16\u201318}} For a 1&nbsp;km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4&nbsp;nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.\n\nClocks in a gravitational field do not all run at the same rate. Experiments such as the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the ''space'' component of spacetime. But the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do not depend on the details of general relativity at all. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}} This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the \"[[Newtonian limit]]\" (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the gravitational field is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton's law of gravity.<ref name=\"Carroll\">{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Lecture Notes on General Relativity|date=2 December 1997|eprint=gr-qc/9712019}}</ref>{{rp|101\u2013106}}\n\nNewtonian gravitation is a theory of curved time. General relativity is a theory of curved time ''and'' curved space.

Origin of gravitomagnetism]]\nIt is well known that the force of magnetism can be deduced by applying the rules of special relativity to moving charges. (An eloquent demonstration of this was presented by Feynman in volume II, {{nowrap|1=chapter 13\u20136}} of his ''Lectures on Physics'', available online.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=R.

In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7a, two parallel, infinitely long streams of massive particles have equal and opposite velocities \u2212''v'' and +''v'' relative to a test particle at rest and centered between the two. Because of the symmetry of the setup, the net force on the \ncentral particle is zero. Assume {{tmath|1=v \\ll c}} so that velocities are simply additive.  Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7b shows exactly the same setup, but in the frame of the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +''v'', and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2''v''. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But it is not at all clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.\n\n[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|right|thumb|Figure 5-8.

Taken together, {{nowrap|1=mass-energy}}, momentum, pressure and stress all serve as sources of gravity: Collectively, they are what tells spacetime how to curve.\n\nGeneral relativity predicts that pressure acts as a gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass-energy density. The inclusion of pressure as a source of gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation. For example, the pressure term sets a maximum limit to the mass of a [[neutron star]]. The more massive a neutron star, the more pressure is required to support its weight against gravity. The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star's mass.

[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagrams]] can be used to visualize [[Special relativity|relativistic]] effects, such as why different observers perceive where and when events occur differently.\n\nUntil the 20th century, it was assumed that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its spatial expression in terms of coordinates, distances, and directions) was independent of one-dimensional time. However, in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] based [[wikisource:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|a work on special relativity]] on two postulates:\n\n* The laws of physics are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (i.e., identical) in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]] (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference)\n* The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe logical consequence of taking these postulates together is the inseparable joining together of the four dimensions\u2014hitherto assumed as independent\u2014of space and time. Many counterintuitive consequences emerge: in addition to being independent of the motion of the light source, the speed of light has the same speed regardless of the frame of reference in which it is measured; the distances and even temporal ordering of pairs of events change when measured in different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] (this is the [[relativity of simultaneity]]); and the linear additivity of velocities no longer holds true.\n\nEinstein framed his theory in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). His theory was an advance over [[History of special relativity#Lorentz's 1904 model|Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena]] and [[History of special relativity#Poincar\u00e9's dynamics of the electron|Poincar\u00e9's electrodynamic theory]].

A key feature of this interpretation is the formal definition of the spacetime interval. Although measurements of distance and time between [[Event (relativity)|events]] differ for measurements made in different reference frames, the spacetime interval is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which they are recorded.\n\nMinkowski's geometric interpretation of relativity was to prove vital to Einstein's development of his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], wherein he showed how [[stress\u2013energy tensor|mass and energy]] [[Riemann curvature tensor|curve]] flat spacetime into a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].\n\n{{anchor|Contents}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Introduction}}\n{{anchor|Definitions}}\n\n=== Definitions ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

[[General relativity]] also provides an explanation of how [[gravitational fields]] can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.\n\nIn ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as [[dimension#In physics|dimensions]]. In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], these are called x, y, and z. A position in spacetime is called an ''event'', and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig.&nbsp;1). Spacetime is thus [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensional]]. An event is something that happens instantaneously at a single point in spacetime, represented by a set of coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''t''.\n\nThe word \"event\" used in relativity should not be confused with the use of the word \"event\" in normal conversation, where it might refer to an \"event\" as something such as a concert, sporting event, or a battle. These are not mathematical \"events\" in the way the word is used in relativity, because they have finite durations and extents. Unlike the analogies used to explain events, such as firecrackers or lightning bolts, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime.\n\nThe path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a succession of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a line which represents a particle's progress through spacetime. That line is called the particle's ''world line''.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nMathematically, spacetime is a ''[[manifold]]'', which is to say, it appears locally \"flat\" near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, a globe appears flat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowland |first1=Todd |title=Manifold |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Manifold.html |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> An extremely large scale factor, <math>c</math> (conventionally called the ''speed-of-light'') relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time.

It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]], that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=A.P.|title=Special Relativity|date=1968|publisher=CRC Press|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0748764224|pages=35\u201360}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1-1}}\n[[File:Observer in special relativity.svg|thumb|Figure 1-1.

This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location. In Fig.&nbsp;1&#8209;1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term ''observer'' refers to the entire ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetime_physics/|title=Spacetime Physics: Introduction to Special Relativity|last1=Taylor|first1=Edwin F.|last2=Wheeler|first2=John Archibald|date=1992|publisher=Freeman|isbn=071670336X|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|pages=|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|17\u201322}} In this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer, however, will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the [[data reduction]] following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.\n\nIn many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word \"observer\" is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.\n\nPhysicists distinguish between what one ''measures'' or ''observes'' (after one has factored out signal propagation delays), versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failure to understand [[Special relativity#Measurement versus visual appearance|the difference between what one measures/observes versus what one sees]] is the source of much error among beginning students of relativity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=Rachel E.|last2=Shaffer|first2=Peter S.|last3=Vokos|first3=Stamatis|title=Student understanding of time in special relativity: Simultaneity and reference frames|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=July 2001|volume=69|issue=S1|pages=S24\u2013S35|doi=10.1119/1.1371254|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0207/0207109.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2017|bibcode = 2001AmJPh..69S..24S |arxiv=physics/0207109}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n{{anchor|History}}\n{{main | History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n | image1            = Michelson-Morley experiment conducted with white light.png\n <!-- | caption1          = -->\n | image2            = MichelsonMorleyAnimationDE.gif\n | caption2          = Figure 1-2.

Among other issues, the dependence of the partial [[aether-dragging]] implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether ''simultaneously'' flows at different speeds for different colors of light.<ref name=Stachel>{{cite book |last=Stachel |first=John |editor1-last=Kox |editor1-first=A.

(No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.)\n\nBy 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein were to derive later (i.e. the [[Lorentz transform]]), but with a fundamentally different interpretation. As a theory of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter.<ref name=\"Pais\">{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=\"\"Subtle is the Lord-- \": The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019853907X|edition=11th|url=https://archive.org/details/subtleislordscie00pais}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013174}} Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called ''local time'', with which he could explain the [[aberration of light]], the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.

However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital, and in 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity.<ref name=\"Pais\"/>{{rp|151\u2013152}} Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as ''Minkowski spacetime.''\n\n== Spacetime in special relativity ==\n{{anchor|Spacetime interval}} <!-- This section is linked from [[Lorentz transformation]] -->\n\n=== Spacetime interval ===\nIn three-dimensions, the ''distance'' <math>\\Delta{d}</math> between two points can be defined using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\Delta{d}\\right)}^2 = {\\left(\\Delta{x}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{y}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{z}\\right)}^2</math>\nAlthough two viewers may measure the x,y, and z position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both (assuming that they are measuring using the same units). The distance is \"invariant\".\n\nIn special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers when one of the observers is moving, because of [[Lorentz contraction]].  The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because (from their point of view) they are stationary, and the position of the event is receding or approaching.  Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective \"distance\" between two events.\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the ''interval''.  Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]]. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two ''[[event (relativity)|events]]'' (because of [[time dilation]]) or the distance between the two events (because of [[length contraction]]). But special relativity provides a new invariant, called the ''spacetime interval'', which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure time and distance carefully will find the same spacetime interval between any two events. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by <math>\\Delta t</math> and a spatial distance <math>\\Delta x</math>. Then the spacetime interval <math>{\\left(\\Delta{s}\\right)}^2</math> between the two events that are separated by a distance <math>\\Delta{x}</math> in space and by <math>\\Delta{ct}= c\\Delta t</math> in the <math>ct</math>-coordinate is:\n\n:<math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 </math>, or for three space dimensions, <math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2</math><ref>{{cite book |title=Differential Manifolds and Theoretical Physics |first1=W.

The spacetime interval is the quantity <math>s^2</math>, not <math>s</math> itself. The reason is that unlike distances in Euclidean geometry, intervals in Minkowski spacetime can be negative.

In other words, the spacetime interval between two events on the world line of something moving at the speed of light is zero. Such an interval is termed ''lightlike'' or ''null''. A photon arriving in our eye from a distant star will not have aged, despite having (from our perspective) spent years in its passage.\n\nA spacetime diagram is typically drawn with only a single space and a single time coordinate. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;1 presents a spacetime diagram illustrating the ''[[world lines]]'' (i.e. paths in spacetime) of two photons, A and B, originating from the same event and going in opposite directions. In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by <math>\\textrm{c}</math> so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of \u00b11. In other words, every meter that a photon travels to the left or right requires approximately 3.3 nanoseconds of time.\n\n'''Note on nomenclature:''' There are two sign conventions in use in the relativity literature:\n: <math>s^2 = (\\textrm{c} t)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2</math>\n: and\n: <math>s^2 = - (\\textrm{c} t)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2</math>\n\nThese sign conventions are associated with the ''[[metric signature]]s'' {{nowrap|(+&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212)}} and {{nowrap|(\u2212&thinsp;+&thinsp;+&thinsp;+).}} A minor variation is to place the time coordinate last rather than first.

With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;2, two [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion.

Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b illustrates a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S\u2032 are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S and ''t''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S'. The ''ct''\u2032 axis passes through the events in frame S\u2032 which have ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. But the points with ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are moving in the ''x''-direction of frame S with velocity ''v'', so that they are not coincident with the ''ct'' axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the ''ct''\u2032 axis is tilted with respect to the ''ct'' axis by an angle ''\u03b8'' given by\n\n: <math>\\tan\\ \\theta = v/c .</math>\n\nThe ''x''\u2032 axis is also tilted with respect to the ''x'' axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always&nbsp;\u00b11. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O\u2032. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''a''. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance ''a'' from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'' (event R).\n\nThe same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b in the frame of observer O. The light paths have slopes&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;\u22121 so that \u25b3PQR forms a right triangle.

The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a [[Cartesian plane]], and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.\n\n{{anchor|Light cone}}\n\n=== Light cone ===\n{{main|light cone}}\n{{anchor|Figure 2-4}}\n[[File:ModernPhysicsSpaceTimeA.png|thumb|Figure 2-4. The light cone centered on an event divides the rest of spacetime into the future, the past, and \"elsewhere\"]]\nIn Fig. 2-4, event&nbsp;O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the ''light cone'' of the event&nbsp;O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;5) makes the appearance that of two [[cone|right circular cones]] meeting with their apices at&nbsp;O. One cone extends into the future (t>0), the other into the past (t<0).\n\n[[File:World line.png|thumb|Figure 2-5. Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension]]\nA light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more ''time'' (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their ''spatial distance'' at lightspeed; these events comprise the ''timelike future'' of the event&nbsp;O. Likewise, the ''timelike past'' comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in ''timelike intervals'' &Delta;''ct'' is greater than &Delta;''x'', making timelike intervals positive. The region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event&nbsp;O by more ''space'' than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given ''time''. These events comprise the so-called ''spacelike'' region of the event&nbsp;O, denoted  \"Elsewhere\" in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be ''lightlike'' (or ''null separated'') from&nbsp;O.  Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220}}\n\nThe light cone has an essential role within the concept of [[causality]]. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of&nbsp;O to the position and time of D (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4). It is hence possible for event&nbsp;O to have a causal influence on event&nbsp;D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.&nbsp;B or&nbsp;C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event&nbsp;O, nor can they be affected by event&nbsp;O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event&nbsp;O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Erik|last2=Bokulich|first2=Peter|title=Lightcones and Causal Structure|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Relativity of simultaneity}}\n\n=== Relativity of simultaneity ===\n{{anchor|Figure 2-6}}\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity Animation.gif|thumb|Figure 2-6.

Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event's past light cone occurs ''before'' the given event. The before-after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. [[#Figure 2-4|'''Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4''']] was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at {{nowrap|1=''v'' = 0.}} From this reference frame, event&nbsp;C is observed to occur after event&nbsp;O, and event&nbsp;B is observed to occur before event&nbsp;O. From a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are ''necessarily'' separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame, is termed the [[relativity of simultaneity]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven|title=Being and Becoming in Modern Physics. 3.

Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24 meters ({{val|1.75|e=\u22128|u=s}}), while for a clock traveling at 0.7''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00 meters ({{val|2.34|e=\u22128|u=s}}). This illustrates the phenomenon known as [[time dilation]]. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x&ndash;axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220\u2013221}} The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual.

Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one's frame of reference. But events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are, in general, not simultaneous in other frames of reference.\n\nFig. 2-9 illustrates the motions of a 1&nbsp;m rod that is traveling at 0.5&nbsp;''c'' along the ''x'' axis.

The endpoints O and B measured when {{\u2032|''t''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are simultaneous events in the S\u2032 frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the ''x''-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's ''world sheet'' onto the ''x'' axis yields the foreshortened length OC.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n(not illustrated) Drawing a vertical line through A so that it intersects the ''x''' axis demonstrates that, even as OB is foreshortened from the point of view of observer O, OA is likewise foreshortened from the point of view of observer O\u2032. In the same way that each observer measures the other's clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other's rulers as being contracted.\n\nIn regards to mutual length contraction, [[#Figure 2-9|'''&nbsp;2&#8209;9''']] illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually [[Lorentz transformation#Coordinate transformation|rotated]] by a [[hyperbolic angle]] (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry).<ref group=note>In a [[Cartesian plane]], ordinary rotation leaves a circle unchanged.

If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S', as running slower than his', while S' is moving at speed ''v'' in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S' likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed \u2212''v'' in S', as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run ''both slower'' than the other, is an important question that \"goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.\"<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198}}\n\nBasically, this apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the ''only apparent'' contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W' (at rest in S'), one uses ''two'' additional, synchronized clocks W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance ''d''.\n:<small>Two events can be defined by the condition \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\", i.e., when W' passes each  W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. For both events the two readings of the collocated clocks are recorded. The difference of the two readings of W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> is the temporal distance of the two events in S, and their spatial distance is ''d''. The difference of the two readings of W' is the temporal distance of the two events in S'. In S' these events are only separated in time, they happen at the same place in S'. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval spanned by these two events, and the nonzero spatial separation ''d'' in S, the temporal distance in S' must be smaller than the one in S: the ''smaller'' temporal distance between the two events, resulting from the readings of the moving clock W', belongs to the ''slower'' running clock W'.</small>\n\nConversely, for judging in frame S' the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S'.\n:<small>In this comparison the clock W is moving by with velocity -''v''. Recording again the four readings for the events, defined by \"two clocks simultaneously at one place\", results in the analogous temporal distances of the two events, now temporally and spatially separated in S', and only temporally separated but collocated in S. To keep the spacetime interval invariant, the temporal distance in S must be smaller than in S', because of the spatial separation of the events in S': now clock W is observed to run slower.</small>\n\nObviously, the necessary recordings for the two judgements, with \"one moving clock\" and \"two clocks at rest\" in respectively S or S', involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally \"consistent\" such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the one's clock to be fast.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=250\n| image2 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation B.png  |width2=300|height2=300\n| image4 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation D.png  |width4=300|height4=300\n| footer = Figure 2-10. Mutual time dilation }}\nFig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S \"at rest\" with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S' \"moving with ''v'' > 0\", coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S' \"at rest\" with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S \"moving with \u2212''v'' < 0\", with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.\n\nEach line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (''x'', ''x\u2032'') represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (''ct'', ''ct\u2032''). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (''ct'', ''ct\u2032'') represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (''x'', ''x\u2032'').\n\n:<small>One may designate in both pictures the origin ''O'' (= ''O\u2032'') as the event, where the respective \"moving clock\" is collocated with the \"first clock at rest\" in both comparisons. Obviously, for this event the readings on both clocks in both comparisons are zero. As a consequence, the worldlines of the  moving clocks are the slanted to the right ''ct\u2032''-axis (upper pictures, clock W') and the slanted to the left ''ct''-axes (lower pictures, clock W). The worldlines of W<sub>1</sub> and W'<sub>1</sub> are the corresponding vertical time axes (''ct'' in the upper pictures, and ''ct\u2032'' in the lower pictures).</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the place for W<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''A''<sub>''x''</sub> > 0, and thus the worldline (not shown in the pictures) of this clock intersects the worldline of the moving clock (the ''ct\u2032''-axis)  in the event labelled ''A'', where \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\". In the lower picture the place for W'<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''C''<sub>''x\u2032''</sub> < 0, and so in this measurement the moving clock W passes W'<sub>2</sub> in the event ''C''.</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the ''ct''-coordinate ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> of the event ''A'' (the reading of W<sub>2</sub>) is labeled ''B'', thus giving the elapsed time between the two events, measured with W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>, as ''OB''. For a comparison, the length of the time interval ''OA'', measured with W', must be transformed to the scale of the ''ct''-axis. This is done by the invariant hyperbola (see also Fig. 2-8) through ''A'', connecting all events with the same spacetime interval from the origin as ''A''. This yields the event ''C'' on the ''ct''-axis, and obviously: ''OC'' < ''OB'', the \"moving\" clock W' runs slower.</small>\n\nTo show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event ''D'' may be constructed as the event at ''x\u2032'' = 0 (the location of clock W' in S'), that is simultaneous to ''C'' (''OC'' has equal spacetime interval as ''OA'') in S'. This shows that the time interval ''OD'' is longer than ''OA'', showing that the \"moving\" clock runs slower.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|124}}\n\nIn the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity -''v'' in the frame S' at rest. The worldline of clock W is the ''ct''-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W'<sub>1</sub> is the vertical ''ct\u2032''-axis, and the worldline of W'<sub>2</sub> is the vertical through event ''C'', with ''ct\u2032''-coordinate ''D''. The invariant hyperbola through event ''C'' scales the time interval ''OC'' to ''OA'', which is shorter than ''OD''; also, ''B'' is constructed (similar to ''D'' in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to ''A'' in S, at ''x'' = 0. The result ''OB'' > ''OC'' corresponds again to above.\n\nThe word \"measure\" is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object's state of motion ''can'' affect the observer's ''observations'' of the object.\n\n==== Twin paradox ====\nMany introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of \"paradoxes\". These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\">{{cite book|last1=Schutz|first1=Bernard F.|title=A first course in general relativity|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521277035|page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[twin paradox]] is a [[thought experiment]] involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|207}} Nevertheless, the ''twin paradox'' is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.\n\nThe impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/><ref group=note>Even with no (de)acceleration i.e. using one inertial frame O for constant, high-velocity outward journey and another inertial frame I for constant, high-velocity inward journey - the sum of the elapsed time in those frames (O and I) is shorter than the elapsed time in the stationary inertial frame S. Thus acceleration and deceleration is not the cause of shorter elapsed time during the outward and inward journey. Instead the use of two different constant, high-velocity inertial frames for outward and inward journey is really the cause of shorter elapsed time total. Granted, if the same twin has to travel outward and inward leg of the journey and safely switch from outward to inward leg of the journey, the acceleration and deceleration is required. If the travelling twin could ride the high-velocity outward inertial frame and instantaneously switch to high-velocity inward inertial frame the example would still work. The point is that real reason should be stated clearly. The asymmetry is because of the comparison of sum of elapsed times in two different inertial frames (O and I) to the elapsed time in a single inertial frame S.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Introductory Physics fig 4.9.png|thumb|Figure 2-11. Spacetime explanation of the twin paradox]]\nDeeper analysis is needed before we can understand why these distinctions should result in a difference in the twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the [[Line integral|path integral]]) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.<ref name=\"Weiss\">{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Michael |title=The Twin Paradox |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/TwinParadox/twin_paradox.html |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nComplications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin's point of view.\n\nFor the rest of this discussion, we adopt Weiss's nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nWe had previously noted that Stella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity. This is not true.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\n:<small>A pure SR analysis would be as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> [[#Figure 2-6|'''Figs.&nbsp;2&#8209;6''']] and 2&#8209;11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, ''from Stella's point of view'', are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. ''But during the turnaround'' (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift takes place in the angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, at the end of her trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/></small>\n\nAlthough general relativity is not ''required'' to analyze the twin paradox, application of the [[Equivalence Principle]] of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip.  When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of [[gravitational time dilation]], his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> As will be discussed in the forthcoming section [[#Curvature of time|'''Curvature of time''']], the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}}\n{{anchor|Gravitation}}\n\n=== Gravitation ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

Event&nbsp;P has coordinates (''w'',&nbsp;''x'') in the black \"rest system\" and coordinates {{math|1=({{\u2032|''w''}},&nbsp;{{\u2032|''x''}})}} in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c''}}. How do we determine {{\u2032|''w''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}} in terms of ''w'' and ''x''? (Or the other way around, of course.)\n\nIt is easier at first to derive the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation.\n#We start by noting that there can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. ''y{{'}}'' must equal ''y'' and {{\u2032|''z''}} must equal ''z'', otherwise whether a fast moving 1&nbsp;m ball could fit through a 1&nbsp;m circular hole would depend on the observer.

From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for {{\u2032|''t''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}}.\n\n==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====\nThe Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since ''x{{'}}'' and ''t{{'}}'' are obtained as linear combinations of ''x'' and ''t'', with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|67}} All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|72\u201373}} Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|190}}\n\nA result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.\n\n<small>'''Example:''' Terence observes Stella speeding away from him at 0.500&nbsp;c, and he can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.500}} to relate Stella's measurements to his own. Stella, in her frame, observes Ursula traveling away from her at 0.250&nbsp;c, and she can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.250}} to relate Ursula's measurements with her own. Because of the linearity of the transformations and the relativistic composition of velocities, Terence can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.666}} to relate Ursula's measurements with his own.</small>\n\n{{anchor|Doppler effect}}\n\n=== Doppler effect ===\n{{main|Doppler effect|Relativistic Doppler effect}}\n\nThe [[Doppler effect]] is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line ([[transverse Doppler effect]]). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.\n\n==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====\nThe classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of ''v<sub>s</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>s</sub>'', the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta _s}f_0</math>\n\nOn the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of ''v<sub>r</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>r</sub>'', the wavelength is ''not'' changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = (1-\\beta _r)f_0</math>\n\n[[File:Spacetime Diagram of Relativistic Doppler Effect.svg|thumb|Figure 3-6. Spacetime diagram of relativistic Doppler effect]]\nLight, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter ''&beta;'', so that the separation between source and receiver at time ''w'' is ''&beta;w''. Because of time dilation, {{tmath|1=W=Y W^{\\prime} }}. Since the slope of the green light ray is \u22121, {{tmath|1={T}=W+\\beta w=\\gamma w^{\\prime}(1+\\beta)}}.

Transverse Doppler effect scenarios]]\nSuppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:<ref name=\"Morin2008\">{{cite book |last1=Morin |first1=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87622-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocl00mori }}</ref>{{rp|541\u2013543}}\n{{plainlist|\n* Fig. 3-7a. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver is geometrically at its closest approach to the source? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S' of the source.<ref group=note>\nThe ease of analyzing a relativistic scenario often depends on the frame in which one chooses to perform the analysis. '''[[:File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 3.svg|In this linked image]],''' we present alternative views of the transverse Doppler shift scenario where source and receiver are at their closest approach to each other.\n\n(a) If we analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver, we find that the analysis is more complicated than it should be. The apparent position of a celestial object is displaced from its true position (or geometric position) because of the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer. The source would be time-dilated relative to the receiver, but the redshift implied by this time dilation would be offset by a blueshift due to the longitudinal component of the relative motion between the receiver and the apparent position of the source.\n\n(b) It is much easier if, instead, we analyze the scenario from the frame of the source. An observer situated at the source knows, from the problem statement, that the receiver is at its closest point to him. That means that the receiver has no longitudinal component of motion to complicate the analysis. Since the receiver's clocks are time-dilated relative to the source, the light that the receiver receives is therefore blue-shifted by a factor of ''gamma.''</ref>\n* Fig. 3-7b. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver ''sees'' the source as being closest to it? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S of the receiver.\n\nTwo other scenarios are commonly examined in discussions of transverse Doppler shift:\n* Fig. 3-7c. If the receiver is moving in a circle around the source, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n* Fig. 3-7d. If the source is moving in a circle around the receiver, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n}}<!--end plainlist-->\nIn scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time  (i.e. dr/dt&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency ''f{{'}}'', but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame&nbsp;S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by [[blueshifted]] light of frequency\n:<math>f = f' \\gamma = f' / \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nIn scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is [[redshifted]] with frequency\n:<math>f = f' / \\gamma = f' \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nScenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of <math>\\gamma</math>, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.)<ref name=\"Morin2008\"/>{{rp|541\u2013543}} Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).<ref group=note>Not all experiments characterize the effect in terms of a redshift. For example, the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment#Relativistic Doppler effect|K\u00fcndig experiment]] was set up to measure transverse blueshift using a M\u00f6ssbauer source setup at the center of a centrifuge rotor and an absorber at the rim.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Energy and momentum}}\n\n=== Energy and momentum ===\n{{main|Four-momentum|Momentum|Mass\u2013energy equivalence}}\n\n==== Extending momentum to four dimensions ====\n[[File:Relativistic spacetime momentum vector.svg|thumb|330px|Figure 3-8. Relativistic spacetime momentum vector]]\nIn classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. [[Linear momentum]], the product of a particle's mass and velocity, is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: {{math|1='''''p'''''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'''v'''''}}. It is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector {{tmath|(x,t)}}. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}, but the time component equals ''mc''.\n\nWe can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that {{tmath|1=(m c)^{\\prime}=y m c}} and {{tmath|1=p^{\\prime}=-\\beta y m c}}, since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches ''c''.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|84\u201387}}\n\nWe will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the [[four-momentum]].\n\n==== Momentum of light ====\n[[File:Calculating the energy of light in different inertial frames.svg|thumb|Figure 3-9. Energy and momentum of light in different inertial frames]]\nLight particles, or photons, travel at the speed of ''c'', the constant that is conventionally known as the ''speed of light''. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.\n\nA consequence of [[Maxwell's theory]] of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: {{tmath|1=E/p = c}}. Rearranging, {{tmath|1=E/c = p}}, and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, ''E/c'' must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.\n\nPhotons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in ''&gamma;mc'' must be zero, meaning that photons are [[massless particle]]s. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but ''E/c'' is well-defined.\n\nBy this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals ''E'' in the rest frame, it equals {{tmath|1=E^{\\prime}=(1-\\beta) \\gamma E }}in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|88}}\n\n==== Mass-energy relationship ====\nConsideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several famous conclusions.\n\n*In the low speed limit as {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v/c''}} approaches zero, {{mvar|&gamma;}} approaches 1, so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum {{tmath|1=\\beta y m c=y m v}} approaches ''mv'', the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective, ''&gamma;m'' can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of ''m''. Einstein proposed that the ''[[relativistic mass]]'' of an object increases with velocity according to the formula {{tmath|1=m_{r e l}=Y m}}.\n*Likewise, comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon, {{tmath|1=y m c=m_{r e l} c=E / c}}, so that Einstein arrived at the relationship {{tmath|1=E=m_{r e l} c^{2} }}. Simplified to the case of zero velocity, this is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass.\n\nAnother way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of {{math|1=''&gamma;mc''<sup>2</sup>}} at low velocity:\n: <math> E = \\gamma m c^2 =\\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta ^ 2}}</math> <math>\\approx m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 ...</math>\nThe second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|90\u201392}}<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\nThe concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, ''m<sub>rel</sub>'', although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=H.

Using an uppercase ''P'' to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase '''''p''''' to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as\n: <math>P \\equiv (E/c, \\vec{p}) = (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z)</math> or alternatively,\n: <math>P \\equiv (E, \\vec{p}) = (E, p_x, p_y, p_z) </math> using the convention that <math>c = 1 .</math><ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\n{{anchor|Conservation laws}}\n\n=== Conservation laws ===\n{{main|Conservation law}}\n\nIn physics, conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915, [[Emmy Noether]] discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Byers|first1=Nina|title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws|eprint=physics/9807044|year=1998}}</ref> The fact that physical processes don't care ''where'' in space they take place ([[space translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of momentum]], the fact that such processes don't care ''when'' they take place ([[time translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of energy]], and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.\n\n==== Total momentum ====\n[[File:Relativistic conservation of momentum.png|thumb|Figure 3-10. Relativistic conservation of momentum]]\nTo understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: \n:(1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision. \n:(2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. \nFor both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.\n\nIn case (2), two masses with momentums {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{1} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{1} } }} \nand {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{2} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{2} } }} collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }} traveling at the [[center of mass]] velocity of the original system, <math>\\boldsymbol{v_{c m}}=\\left(m_{1} \\boldsymbol{v_1}+m_{2} \\boldsymbol{v_2}\\right) /\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) </math>. The total momentum {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p=p_{1}+p_{2} } }} is conserved.\n\nFig.&nbsp;3&#8209;10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components {{tmath|E_{1} / c}} and {{tmath|E_{2} / c}} add up to total ''E/c'' of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{1} } }} and {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{2} } }} add up to form ''p'' of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: {{tmath|1=m>m_{1}+m_{2} }}.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|94\u201397}}\n\nLooking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable [[elementary particle]] spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\n==== Choice of reference frames ====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=2-body Particle Decay-Lab.svg|width1=115|image2=2-body Particle Decay-CoM.svg|width2=105|caption1=Figure 3-11. <br/>(above) '''Lab Frame'''.<br/>(right) '''Center of Momentum Frame'''.|&nbsp;}}\nThe freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the \"[[center-of-momentum frame]]\" (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.\n\n[[#Contents|''Return to Introduction'']]\n\n==== Energy and momentum conservation ====\nIn a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}}, the momentum {{tmath|1=p' = p - mu}}. If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nConservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }}. In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined&mdash;an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nNewtonian momenta, calculated as {{tmath|1=p = mv}}, fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}} is replaced by the highly nonlinear\n{{tmath|1=v^{\\prime}=(v-u) \\Big/\\left(1- \\frac{v u} { c^{2} }\\right)}} so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. As we have discussed in the previous section on [[#Four-momentum|'''four-momentum''']], this second option was what he chose.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|104}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Energy-momentum diagram for pion decay (A).png\n | width1            = <!-- displayed width of image; overridden by \"width\" above -->\n | alt1              = \n | caption1          = Figure 3-12a.

Mass is no longer conserved independently, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy.

Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally [[tensors]], greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are ''manifestly'' relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of [[Maxwell's equations]] in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation (really no more than an observation) using the [[field strength tensor]] formulation. On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities. Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors, capable of connecting such  {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}} even within a ''curved'' spacetime, and not just within a ''flat'' one as in special relativity. The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article, which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime.\n\n==== Definition of 4-vectors ====\nA 4-tuple, {{tmath|1=A=\\left(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\\right)}} is a \"4-vector\" if its component ''A<sub>&thinsp;i</sub>'' transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf using {{tmath|1=(ct, x, y, z)}} coordinates, ''A'' is a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} if it transforms (in the {{nowrap|1=''x''-direction}}) according to\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A_0' &= \\gamma \\left( A_0 - (v/c) A_1 \\right)  \\\\ \n  A_1' &= \\gamma \\left( A_1 - (v/c) A_0 \\right)\\\\\n  A_2' &= A_2 \\\\ \n  A_3' &= A_3\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich comes from simply replacing ''ct'' with ''A''<sub>0</sub> and ''x'' with ''A''<sub>1</sub> in the earlier presentation of the [[#Lorentz transformations|'''Lorentz transformation.''']]\n\nAs usual, when we write ''x'', ''t'', etc. we generally mean ''&Delta;x'', ''&Delta;t'' etc.\n\nThe last three components of a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space.

The rule is that two {{nowrap|1=4-vectors}} are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45\u00b0 line which is the world line of a light ray. This implies that a lightlike {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} is orthogonal with ''itself''.\n* '''Invariance of the magnitude of a vector:''' The magnitude of a vector is the inner product of a {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} with itself, and is a frame-independent property.

Note that a null vector is not the same as a zero vector. A null vector is one for which <math>A \\cdot A = 0 ,</math> while a zero vector is one whose components are all zero.

The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.<ref name=\"PhysicsFAQ\"/>\n\nIn this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.\n\n{{anchor|Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox}}\n\n==== Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ====\n{{main|Bell's spaceship paradox}}\n\nThe Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ([[Bell's spaceship paradox]]) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.\n\n[[File:Bell's spaceship paradox - two spaceships - initial setup.png|thumb|Figure 4-4. Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox]]\nIn Fig.&nbsp;4&#8209;4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string which is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration.<ref group=note>In relativity theory, proper acceleration is the physical acceleration (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a free-fall, or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured.</ref> Will the string break?\n\nThe [[Bell's spaceship paradox|main article for this section]] recounts how, when the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n# To observers in the rest frame, the spaceships start a distance ''L'' apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration. During acceleration, ''L'' is a length contracted distance of the distance {{nowrap|1=''L{{'}} = &gamma;L''}} in the frame of the accelerating spaceships. After a sufficiently long time, ''&gamma;'' will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break.\n# Let ''A'' and ''B'' be the rear and front spaceships. In the frame of the spaceships, each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing. ''A'' says that ''B'' has the same acceleration that he has, and ''B'' sees that ''A'' matches her every move. So the spaceships stay the same distance apart, and the string does not break.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\nThe problem with the first argument is that there is no \"frame of the spaceships.\" There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Bell observers experiment2.png|thumb|Figure 4-5.

Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. We say that the satellite always follows along the path of a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]]. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nIn any analysis of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of ''two'' bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational field of the Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with respect to each other do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the ''appearance'' of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nTwo central propositions underlie general relativity. \n* The first crucial concept is coordinate independence: The laws of physics cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension of the principle of relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames.

Einstein's argument suggesting gravitational redshift]]\nIn the discussion of special relativity, forces played no more than a background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate as the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a ''global'' inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, ''local'' inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nShortly after the publication of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following [[thought experiment]]: (i) Assume that a tower of height ''h'' (Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass ''m'' from the top of the tower. It falls freely with acceleration ''g'', reaching the ground with velocity {{math|1=''v'' = (2''gh'')<sup>1/2</sup>}}, so that its total energy ''E'', as measured by an observer on the ground, is {{tmath|1=m + \\frac{\\frac 1 2 m v^2} {c^2} = m + \\frac{m g h} {c^2} }} (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon ''E{{'}}'' back into a particle of rest mass ''m{{'}}''.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nIt must be that {{math|1=''m'' = ''m{{'}}''}}, since otherwise one would be able to construct a [[perpetual motion]] device. We therefore predict that {{math|1=''E{{'}}'' = ''m''}}, so that\n: <math>\\frac{E'}{E} = \\frac{h \\nu \\, '}{ h \\nu} = \\frac{m}{m + \\frac{mgh}{c^2}} = 1 - \\frac{gh}{c^2}</math>\n\nA photon climbing in Earth's gravitational field loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical observations were somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory observations were performed by [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment|Pound & Rebka (1959)]] and later by Pound & Snider (1964).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mester |first1=John |title=Experimental Tests of General Relativity |url=https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |publisher=Laboratoire Univers et Th\u00e9ories |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085505/https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLight has an associated frequency, and this frequency may be used to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive at the top of the tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16\u201318}} For a 1&nbsp;km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4&nbsp;nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.\n\nClocks in a gravitational field do not all run at the same rate. Experiments such as the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the ''space'' component of spacetime. But the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do not depend on the details of general relativity at all. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}} This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the \"[[Newtonian limit]]\" (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the gravitational field is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton's law of gravity.<ref name=\"Carroll\">{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Lecture Notes on General Relativity|date=2 December 1997|eprint=gr-qc/9712019}}</ref>{{rp|101\u2013106}}\n\nNewtonian gravitation is a theory of curved time. General relativity is a theory of curved time ''and'' curved space.

Origin of gravitomagnetism]]\nIt is well known that the force of magnetism can be deduced by applying the rules of special relativity to moving charges. (An eloquent demonstration of this was presented by Feynman in volume II, {{nowrap|1=chapter 13\u20136}} of his ''Lectures on Physics'', available online.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=R.

In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7a, two parallel, infinitely long streams of massive particles have equal and opposite velocities \u2212''v'' and +''v'' relative to a test particle at rest and centered between the two. Because of the symmetry of the setup, the net force on the \ncentral particle is zero. Assume {{tmath|1=v \\ll c}} so that velocities are simply additive.  Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7b shows exactly the same setup, but in the frame of the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +''v'', and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2''v''. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But it is not at all clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.\n\n[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|right|thumb|Figure 5-8.

Taken together, {{nowrap|1=mass-energy}}, momentum, pressure and stress all serve as sources of gravity: Collectively, they are what tells spacetime how to curve.\n\nGeneral relativity predicts that pressure acts as a gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass-energy density. The inclusion of pressure as a source of gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation.

The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star's mass.

[...]\u00bb\n\nAccording to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}}\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Sifangcheng bixi - right front - P1060418.JPG|thumb|A [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] with the \"Stele of Divine Merits and Saintly Virtues\" (''Shengong Shende''), erected by the [[Yongle Emperor]] in 1413 in honor of his father, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] (\"Ming Mausoleum of Filial Piety\").]]\nIn [[Chinese folk religion]], a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']], commonly associated with [[yin and yang|yang and yin]], respectively. Upon death, ''hun'' and ''po'' separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a [[spirit tablet]]; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.<ref name=\"Smith\">Richard J. Smith (2007). ''Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm</ref> In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased.\n\n===Mourning===\nThe mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of [[congee]] two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings.\n\n===Funeral rites===\n[[File:Cangnan - Longgang - P1210226 - funeral procession.JPG|thumb|A funeral procession in Zhejiang province]]\nFunerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter-generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descents of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife.\n\nSome common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a [[spirit tablet]] or the use of a [[Shi (personator)|personator]], often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.<ref name=\"thompson\">Thompson, L. G. (1979). ''Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc.</ref><ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:Cangnan - Jinxiang - Qiantoulian - P1210370.JPG|thumb|A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast]]\nBurial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or [[Emperor of China|emperor]] would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one.\n\nIn some instances, a \"lucky burial\" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an [[Feng Shui|augur]] to optimize the flow of ''[[qi]]''. A bad ''qi'' flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.<ref name=\"religionfacts\">ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). ''Ancestor Veneration''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm\u2009</ref><ref name=\"thompson\"/>\n\nThe deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food.\n\n===Continued obeisance===\nAfter the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and [[joss paper|spirit money]] are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as [[Qingming Festival]] and [[Ghost Festival]].<ref name=\"religionfacts\"/>\n\n[[Prayer]] was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the ''po'' of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | last = He | first = Qimin | authorlink = | title = Religious Traditions in Local Communities of China | journal = Pastoral Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 823\u2013839 | date = 2012 | language = | jstor = | issn = 0031-2789 | doi = 10.1007/s11089-012-0438-z | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Nadeau| editor-first= Randall L. | year = 2010 | title = Divinity | last = Nadeau | first = Randall | encyclopedia = The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions | url = https://books.google.com/?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&pg=PA369&dq=china+ancestor+worship+veneration#v=onepage&q=china%20ancestor%20worship%20veneration&f=false | ref = harv | isbn= 9781444361971 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Overmyer | first = Daniel L. |authorlink = Daniel L.

Respecting Heaven and honoring ancestors (''jingtian fazu''), taking good care in seeing off the deceased, and maintaining sacrifices to distant ancestors (''shenzhong zhuiyuan'') were the basic religious concepts and emotional expressions in this religion. [...]\u00bb\n\nAccording to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}}\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Sifangcheng bixi - right front - P1060418.JPG|thumb|A [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] with the \"Stele of Divine Merits and Saintly Virtues\" (''Shengong Shende''), erected by the [[Yongle Emperor]] in 1413 in honor of his father, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] (\"Ming Mausoleum of Filial Piety\").]]\nIn [[Chinese folk religion]], a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']], commonly associated with [[yin and yang|yang and yin]], respectively. Upon death, ''hun'' and ''po'' separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a [[spirit tablet]]; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.<ref name=\"Smith\">Richard J. Smith (2007). ''Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm</ref> In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased.\n\n===Mourning===\nThe mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of [[congee]] two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings.\n\n===Funeral rites===\n[[File:Cangnan - Longgang - P1210226 - funeral procession.JPG|thumb|A funeral procession in Zhejiang province]]\nFunerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter-generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descents of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife.\n\nSome common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a [[spirit tablet]] or the use of a [[Shi (personator)|personator]], often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.<ref name=\"thompson\">Thompson, L. G. (1979). ''Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc.</ref><ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:Cangnan - Jinxiang - Qiantoulian - P1210370.JPG|thumb|A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast]]\nBurial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or [[Emperor of China|emperor]] would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one.\n\nIn some instances, a \"lucky burial\" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an [[Feng Shui|augur]] to optimize the flow of ''[[qi]]''. A bad ''qi'' flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.<ref name=\"religionfacts\">ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). ''Ancestor Veneration''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm\u2009</ref><ref name=\"thompson\"/>\n\nThe deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food.\n\n===Continued obeisance===\nAfter the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and [[joss paper|spirit money]] are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as [[Qingming Festival]] and [[Ghost Festival]].<ref name=\"religionfacts\"/>\n\n[[Prayer]] was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the ''po'' of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | last = He | first = Qimin | authorlink = | title = Religious Traditions in Local Communities of China | journal = Pastoral Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 823\u2013839 | date = 2012 | language = | jstor = | issn = 0031-2789 | doi = 10.1007/s11089-012-0438-z | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Nadeau| editor-first= Randall L. | year = 2010 | title = Divinity | last = Nadeau | first = Randall | encyclopedia = The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions | url = https://books.google.com/?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&pg=PA369&dq=china+ancestor+worship+veneration#v=onepage&q=china%20ancestor%20worship%20veneration&f=false | ref = harv | isbn= 9781444361971 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Overmyer | first = Daniel L. |authorlink = Daniel L.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], its flagship [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]]. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''\"PR/PAL 001\"''' and the callsign '''\"PHILIPPINE ONE\"''' is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.\n\nFor the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized \"70\" and the words, \"Asia's first, shining through\".\n\nAs the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft.

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

[[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]]. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''\"PR/PAL 001\"''' and the callsign '''\"PHILIPPINE ONE\"''' is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.\n\nFor the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized \"70\" and the words, \"Asia's first, shining through\".\n\nAs the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft. The sticker features a stylized \"75\".\n\nPAL also placed a 4-star [[Skytrax]] sticker on its aircraft to celebrate their new rating.\n\nOn February 2019, Philippine Airlines rolled out its fifth [[Airbus A350]] aircraft with a \"LoveBus\" decal that represents the 40th anniversary of partnership with Airbus and to celebrate the airline's signature heartfelt service. The kissmarked \"LoveBus\" logo was also placed on 1979 in one of PAL's [[Airbus A300]] that represents the first year of partnership with Airbus. Their \"LoveBus\" A350 rolled out from paint shop and was accepted on February 14, 2019 which was [[Valentines Day]] that time, PAL took delivered it 3 days later and was welcomed at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/02/21/19/look-philippine-airlines-welcomes-5th-airbus-a350-900|title=LOOK: Philippine Airlines welcomes 5th Airbus A350-900|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n== Frequent flyer program ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Mabuhay Miles logo.png|thumb|left| Mabuhay Miles logo]]\n\nMabuhay Miles is the Philippine Airlines [[frequent flyer program]].

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.

During the early 1980s, they sold the company to [[Howard Schultz]] who \u2013 after a business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] \u2013 decided to make the [[coffee bean]] store a coffeeshop serving [[espresso]]-based drinks. Schultz first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pike Place Market - Starbucks circa 1977A.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Pike Place Market]] location in 1977]]\n\n===Founding===\nThe first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 31, 1971,<ref>Starbucks [http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike \"1st and Pike\"], \"Starbucks\", 2016</ref> by three partners who met while they were students at the [[University of San Francisco]]:<ref name=\"TimeOutSF\">{{cite book|author=Time Out|title=Time Out Guide San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esY90CkrXbYC|accessdate=April 9, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Time Out Guides|isbn=978-1-84670-220-4}}</ref> English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]] were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] after he taught them his style of roasting beans.<ref name=Pren2523>Pendergrast, pp. 252\u201353</ref> Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful.

During the early 1980s, they sold the company to [[Howard Schultz]] who \u2013 after a business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] \u2013 decided to make the [[coffee bean]] store a coffeeshop serving [[espresso]]-based drinks. Schultz first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pike Place Market - Starbucks circa 1977A.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Pike Place Market]] location in 1977]]\n\n===Founding===\nThe first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 31, 1971,<ref>Starbucks [http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike \"1st and Pike\"], \"Starbucks\", 2016</ref> by three partners who met while they were students at the [[University of San Francisco]]:<ref name=\"TimeOutSF\">{{cite book|author=Time Out|title=Time Out Guide San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esY90CkrXbYC|accessdate=April 9, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Time Out Guides|isbn=978-1-84670-220-4}}</ref> English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]] were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] after he taught them his style of roasting beans.<ref name=Pren2523>Pendergrast, pp. 252\u201353</ref> Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful.

In 2000, San Francisco [[cartoonist]] [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics, later placing it on coffee mugs, T-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to [[free speech]] under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]], as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially \"profiting\" from using a \"confusingly similar\" image of the Starbucks siren logo.

Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating \"helping children get clean water,\" referring to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6.2 million for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date= |title= Stealing water day|url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110231/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007|magazine= NOW Toronto|quote= \"Maybe they're not trying to sell anything on World Water Day, but every other day of they year they are selling water.\" |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/dynamicdoc/document.cfm?CompanyID=SBUX&DocumentID=1382 |title=Starbucks Corporation 2006 Annual Report |publisher=Shareholder.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands.<ref>Walker, R.

He then became comatose, and died when taken off life support five days later.\n\nAccording to Rackauckas, the coroner stated that the injuries to Thomas' face and head contributed to his death. Also contributing to his death were brain injuries, facial and rib fractures, and the extensive bruising and abrasions he suffered during the beating, which left him lying in a \"growing pool of blood\", Rackauckas said.

He then became comatose, and died when taken off life support five days later.\n\nAccording to Rackauckas, the coroner stated that the injuries to Thomas' face and head contributed to his death. Also contributing to his death were brain injuries, facial and rib fractures, and the extensive bruising and abrasions he suffered during the beating, which left him lying in a \"growing pool of blood\", Rackauckas said.

Cathy Thomas was represented by another lawyer.\n\nDespite the subsequent not guilty verdicts in favor of Officer Ramos and Corporal Cicinelli, Mr. Mardirossian obtained a $4.9 million settlement just before Manuel Ramos, the chief perpetrator, was to testify in the civil jury trial.
