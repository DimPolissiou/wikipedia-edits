{"title_page": "Metropolitan Region Scheme", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n[[Image:MASB.gif|thumb|180px|right|Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme]]\nThe '''Metropolitan Region Scheme''' (MRS) provides the legal basis for future [[Urban planning|land use planning]] throughout the [[Perth Metropolitan Region]]. It classifies land into broad zones and reservations and is administered by the [[Western Australian Planning Commission]]. It is one of three regional schemes in Western Australia. The MRS is updated via an ongoing process of amendments. Amendments to the MRS are typically informed by a series of strategic plans prepared by the [[Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (Western Australia)|Department of Planning, Lands & Heritage]]. Detailed land use planning within the area of the MRS is undertaken by local governments and other [[Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority|statutory authorities]] which prepare one or more [[Planning scheme|local planning schemes]] within their administrative boundaries. Local plannings schemes must be consistent with the MRS and require the approval of the WAPC.\n\n== Background ==\nThe MRS derived from Hepburn and [[Gordon Stephenson|Stephenson]]'s 1955 ''[[1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle|Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle]]'' and has been in operation since 1963.  Hepburn and Stephenson were commissioned by the [[Government of Western Australia]] to develop the plan in 1953. The completed report recommended that a regional planning authority be established for the purpose of implementing a regional planning scheme\u2014a recommendation that was passed into law with the MRTPS Act of 1959. The Act centralised sub-division control, keeping it in the hands of the state government, but delegated many local planning responsibilities to local governments.\n\nSince 1963 the MRS has been continuously updated via a series of amendments which change the zoning or reservation of land to allow for a different land use. These amendments are typically informed by regional strategies prepared on a periodoic basis, commencing with the ''1955 Plan'', followed by the Corridor Plan in 1970, the Metroplan of 1990 and Directions 2031 in 2010.\n\nIn 2006 the ''[[Planning and Development Act 2005]]'' superseded the MRTPS Act 1959.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Greater Bunbury Region Scheme]]\n*[[Peel Region Scheme]]\n*[[Sydney Region Outline Plan]]\n*[[Melbourne Planning Scheme]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/The+planning+system/Region+schemes/default.aspx|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Schemes|accessdate=2009-10-08}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/Plans+and+policies/Publications/45.aspx|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Scheme text|accessdate=2009-10-08}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/vco/secretariat/records/citations/stephenson_g.pdf|title=Honorary Degree Citation, Gordon Stephenson, CBE|work=Murdoch University|accessdate=2007-02-13}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/hansard/hans35.nsf/SBPage/8c77976070143843482565eb00123849|title=Statement by the Minister for Planning|date=8 April 1997|work=Hansard, Parliament of Western Australia|accessdate=2007-02-13}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/Coast/Perth+coastal+planning+strategy/BP4%20Urban%20Development.pdf?id=1109|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Background Paper 4|accessdate=2007-08-16}}\n\n{{coord|31|57|S|115|51|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Perth, Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Government of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Urban planning in Australia]]\n\n\n{{PerthAU-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n[[Image:MASB.gif|thumb|180px|right|Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme]]\nThe '''Metropolitan Region Scheme''' (MRS) provides the legal basis for future [[Urban planning|land use planning]] throughout the [[Perth Metropolitan Region]]. It classifies land into broad zones and reservations and is administered by the [[Western Australian Planning Commission]]. It is one of three regional schemes in Western Australia.\n\nThe MRS is updated via an ongoing process of amendments. Amendments to the MRS are typically informed by a series of strategic plans prepared by the [[Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (Western Australia)|Department of Planning, Lands & Heritage]].\n\nDetailed land use planning within the area of the MRS is undertaken by local governments and other [[Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority|statutory authorities]] which prepare one or more [[Planning scheme|local planning schemes]] within their administrative boundaries. Local plannings schemes must be consistent with the MRS and require the approval of the WAPC.\n\n== Background ==\nThe MRS derived from Hepburn and [[Gordon Stephenson|Stephenson]]'s 1955 ''[[1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle|Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle]]'' and has been in operation since 1963.  Hepburn and Stephenson were commissioned by the [[Government of Western Australia]] to develop the plan in 1953. The completed report recommended that a regional planning authority be established for the purpose of implementing a regional planning scheme\u2014a recommendation that was passed into law with the MRTPS Act of 1959. The Act centralised sub-division control, keeping it in the hands of the state government, but delegated many local planning responsibilities to local governments.\n\nSince 1963 the MRS has been continuously updated via a series of amendments which change the zoning or reservation of land to allow for a different land use. These amendments are typically informed by regional strategies prepared on a periodoic basis, commencing with the ''1955 Plan'', followed by the Corridor Plan in 1970, the Metroplan of 1990 and Directions 2031 in 2010.\n\nIn 2006 the ''[[Planning and Development Act 2005]]'' superseded the MRTPS Act 1959.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Greater Bunbury Region Scheme]]\n*[[Peel Region Scheme]]\n*[[Sydney Region Outline Plan]]\n*[[Melbourne Planning Scheme]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/The+planning+system/Region+schemes/default.aspx|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Schemes|accessdate=2009-10-08}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/Plans+and+policies/Publications/45.aspx|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Scheme text|accessdate=2009-10-08}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/vco/secretariat/records/citations/stephenson_g.pdf|title=Honorary Degree Citation, Gordon Stephenson, CBE|work=Murdoch University|accessdate=2007-02-13}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/hansard/hans35.nsf/SBPage/8c77976070143843482565eb00123849|title=Statement by the Minister for Planning|date=8 April 1997|work=Hansard, Parliament of Western Australia|accessdate=2007-02-13}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/Coast/Perth+coastal+planning+strategy/BP4%20Urban%20Development.pdf?id=1109|work=Planning Western Australia|title=Background Paper 4|accessdate=2007-08-16}}\n\n{{coord|31|57|S|115|51|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Perth, Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Government of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Urban planning in Australia]]\n\n\n{{PerthAU-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Adondai", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Region_Scheme"}
