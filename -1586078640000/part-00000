The undivided CPI had experienced a period of upsurge during the years following the [[Second World War]]. The CPI led armed rebellions in [[Telangana Rebellion|Telangana]], [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]], and [[Kerala]]. However, it soon abandoned the strategy of armed revolution in favour of working within the [[parliamentary]] framework. In 1950, [[B. T. Ranadive]], the CPI general secretary and a prominent representative of the radical sector inside the party, was demoted on grounds of left-adventurism.\n\nUnder the government of the [[Indian National Congress]] party of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], independent India developed close relations and a strategic partnership with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet government consequently wished that the Indian communists moderate their criticism towards the Indian state and assume a supportive role towards the Congress governments. However, large sections of the CPI claimed that India remained a semi-[[feudal]] country, and that [[class struggle]] could not be put on the back-burner for the sake of guarding the interests of Soviet trade and foreign policy. Moreover, the Indian National Congress appeared to be generally hostile towards political competition. In 1959 the central government intervened to impose [[President's Rule]] in Kerala, toppling the [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]] cabinet (the sole non-Congress state government in the country).\n\n===Formation of CPI(M)===\nThe relations between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] soured, leading to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] around this time. In the early 1960s the Communist Party of China began criticising the CPSU of turning [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] and of deviating from the path of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. [[Sino-Indian relations]] also deteriorated, as border disputes between the two countries erupted into the [[Sino-Indian War of 1962]].\n\nThe basis of difference in opinion between the two factions in CPI was ideological \u2013 about the assessment of Indian scenario and the development of a party programme. This difference in opinion was also a reflection of a similar difference at international level on ideology between the Soviet and Chinese parties. The alleged 'right wing' inside the party followed the Soviet path and put forward the idea of joining hands with the then ruling party \u2013 Indian National Congress. Whereas the faction of CPI which later became CPI(M) referred to this as a revisionist approach of class collaboration. It was this ideological difference which later intensified, coupled with the Soviet-Chinese split at the international level and ultimately gave birth to CPI(M).<ref name=kozhikkodepartycongress>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|title=Communist Party in Kerala|publisher=CPI(M)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314030901/http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nHundreds of CPI leaders, accused of being pro-Chinese, were imprisoned. Thousands of Communists were detained without trial.<ref>The bulk of the detainees came from the left wing of the CPI. However, [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] of the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India]] and the [[Workers Party of India]] were also targeted.[http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017160748/http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref> Those targeted by the state accused the pro-Soviet leadership of the CPI of conspiring with the Congress government to ensure their own hegemony over the control of the party.\n\nIn 1962 [[Ajoy Ghosh]], the general secretary of the CPI, died. After his death, [[S.A. Dange]] was installed as the party chairman (a new position) and E.M.S. Namboodiripad as general secretary. This was an attempt to achieve a compromise. Dange represented the rightist faction of the party and E.M.S. the leftist faction.\n\nAt a CPI National Council meeting held on 11 April 1964, 32 Council members walked out in protest, accusing Dange and his followers of \"anti-unity and anti-Communist policies\".<ref>The 32 were [[P.

In this convention the issues of the internal disputes in the party were discussed. 146 delegates, claiming to represent 100,000 CPI members, took part in the proceedings. The convention decided to convene the 7th Party Congress of CPI in [[Calcutta]] later the same year.<ref name=\"basu51\">Basu, Pradip.

These radicals criticised the draft programme proposal prepared by [[M. Basavapunniah]] for undermining [[class struggle]] and failing to take a clear pro-Chinese position in the ideological conflict between the CPSU and CPC.<ref>Suniti Kumar Ghosh was a member of the group that presented this alternative draft proposal.

[[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 32.</ref>\n\nAfter the Tenali convention the CPI left wing organised party district and state conferences. In [[West Bengal]], a few of these meetings became battlegrounds between the most radical elements and the more moderate leadership. At the Calcutta Party District Conference an alternative draft programme was presented to the leadership by Parimal Das Gupta (a leading figure amongst far-left intellectuals in the party). Another alternative proposal was brought forward to the Calcutta Party District Conference by [[Aziz ul Haq]], but Haq was initially banned from presenting it by the conference organisers. At the Calcutta Party District Conference 42 delegates opposed M. Basavapunniah's official draft programme proposal.\n\nAt the Siliguri Party District Conference, the main draft proposal for a party programme was accepted, but with some additional points suggested by the far-left North Bengal cadre [[Charu Majumdar]]. However, [[Harekrishna Konar]] (representing the leadership of the CPI left wing) forbade the raising of the slogan ''Mao Tse-Tung Zindabad'' (Long live Mao Tse-Tung) at the conference.\n\nParimal Das Gupta's document was also presented to the leadership at the West Bengal State Conference of the CPI leftwing. Das Gupta and a few other spoke at the conference, demanding the party ought to adopt the class analysis of the Indian state of the 1951 CPI conference. His proposal was, however, voted down.<ref>Basu, Pradip. Towards Naxalbari (1953\u20131967) \u2013 An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle.

Simultaneously, the Dange group convened a Party Congress of CPI in [[Bombay]]. Thus, the CPI divided into two separate parties. The group which assembled in Calcutta would later adopt the name '[https://www.indianexitpoll.com/political-party/communist-party-of-india-marxist-cpi-m/ Communist Party of India (Marxist)]', to differentiate themselves from the Dange group. The CPI(M) also adopted its own political programme. [[P. Sundarayya]] was elected general secretary of the party.\n\nIn total 422 delegates took part in the Calcutta Congress. CPI(M) claimed that they represented 104,421 CPI members, 60% of the total party membership.\n\nAt the Calcutta conference the party adopted a class analysis of the character of the Indian state, that claimed the Indian [[bourgeoisie]] was increasingly collaborating with [[imperialism]].<ref name=autogenerated2>Basu, Pradip.

[[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 54.</ref>\n\nParimal Das Gupta's alternative draft programme was not circulated at the Calcutta conference. However, [[Souren Basu]], a delegate from the far-left stronghold [[Darjeeling]], spoke at the conference asking why no portrait had been raised of Mao Tse-Tung along the portraits of other communist stalwarts. His intervention met with huge applauses from the delegates of the conference .<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Name===\nCPI(M) is officially known as \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940(''Bharat ki Kamyunist Party Marksvadi'') in Hindi, but it is often known as \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 (''Marksvadi Kamyunist Party'', abbreviated ''MaKaPa'') in press and media circles. During its initial years after the split, the party was often referred by different names such as 'Left Communist Party' or 'Communist Party of India (Left)'. The party has used the name 'Left' because CPI people were dubbed as rightist in nature for their support to Congress-Nehru regime. During Kerala Legislative Assembly elections of 1965 the party has adopted the name '[https://www.indianexitpoll.com/political-party/communist-party-of-india-marxist-cpi-m/ Communist Party of India (Marxist)]' to obtain its election symbol from the Election Commission of India.<ref>[[Jyoti Basu|Basu, Jyoti]].

At the time of the holding of its Calcutta Congress, large sections of its leaders and cadres were jailed without trial. Again on 29\u201330 December, over a thousand CPI (M) cadres were arrested and detained, and held in jail without trial. In 1965 new waves of arrests of CPI(M) cadres took place in [[West Bengal]], as the party launched agitations against the rise in fares in the [[Calcutta Tramways]] and against the then prevailing food crisis. Statewide general strikes and [[hartal]]s were observed on 5 August 1965, 10\u201311 March 1966 and 6 April 1966. The March 1966 general strike results in several deaths in confrontations with police forces.\n\nAlso in Kerala, mass arrests of CPI(M) cadres were carried out during 1965. In [[Bihar]], the party called for a ''[[hartal|Bandh]]'' (general strike) in [[Patna]] on 9 August 1965 in protest against the Congress state government. During the strike, police resorted to violent actions against the organisers of the strike. The strike was followed by agitations in other parts of the state.\n\nP. Sundaraiah, after being released from jail, spent the period of September 1965 \u2013 February 1966 in Moscow for medical treatment. In Moscow he also held talks with the CPSU.<ref>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front \u2013 Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 17-18</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee of CPI(M) held its first meeting on 12\u201319 June 1966. The reason for delaying the holding of a regular CC meeting was the fact that several of the persons elected as CC members at the Calcutta Congress were jailed at the time.<ref>The jailed members of the new CC, at the time of the Calcutta Congress, were [[B.T. Ranadive]], Muzaffar Ahmed, Hare Krishna Konar and Promode Das Gupta. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 44-5.</ref> A CC meeting had been scheduled to have been held in [[Trichur]] during the last days of 1964, but had been cancelled due to the wave of arrests against the party. The meeting discussed tactics for electoral alliances, and concluded that the party should seek to form a broad electoral alliances with all non-reactionary opposition parties in West Bengal (i.e. all parties except Jan Sangh and Swatantra Party). This decision was strongly criticised by the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the radicals within the party itself. The line was changed at a National Council meeting in [[Jullunder]] in October 1966, where it was decided that the party should only form alliances with selected left parties.<ref>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front \u2013 Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''.[Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 234-235.</ref>\n\n===Naxalbari uprising===\n{{main|Naxalite}}\nAt this point the party stood at crossroads. There were radical sections of the party who were wary of the increasing parliamentary focus of the party leadership, especially after the electoral victories in West Bengal and Kerala. Developments in China also affected the situation inside the party. In West Bengal two separate internal dissident tendencies emerged, which both could be identified as supporting the Chinese line.<ref>According to Basu (in Basu, Pradip; Towards Naxalbari (1953\u201367) : An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 2000.) there were two nuclei of radicals in the party organisation in West Bengal. One \"theorist\" section around Parimal Das Gupta in Calcutta, which wanted to persuade the party leadership to correct revisionist mistakes through inner-party debate, and one \"actionist\" section led by [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]] in North Bengal. The 'actionists' were impatient, and strived to organize armed uprisings. According to Basu, due to the prevailing political climate of youth and student rebellion it was the 'actionists' which came to dominate the new Maoist movement in India, instead of the more theoretically advanced sections. This dichotomy is however rebuffed by followers of the radical stream, for example the [http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm CPI(ML) Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013802/http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}.</ref> In 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in [[Naxalbari]], in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]]. The hardliners within CPI(M) saw the Naxalbari uprising as the spark that would ignite the Indian revolution. The Communist Party of China hailed the Naxalbari movement, causing an abrupt break in CPI(M)-CPC relations.<ref>On 1 July ''[[People's Daily]]'' carried an article titled [http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm Spring Thunder Over India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223115803/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}, expressing the support of CPC to the Naxalbari rebels. At its meeting in [[Madurai]] on 18\u201327 August 1967, the Central Committee of CPI(M) adopted a resolution titled 'Resolution on Divergent Views Between Our Party and the Communist Party of China on Certain Fundamental Issues of Programme and Policy'. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 46.</ref> The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government, of which CPI(M) was a major partner. Within the party, the hardliners rallied around an [[All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]]. Following the 1968 [[Burdwan]] plenum of CPI(M) (held on 5\u201312 April 1968), the AICCCR separated themselves from CPI(M). This split divided the party throughout the country. But notably in West Bengal, which was the centre of the violent radicalist stream, no prominent leading figure left the party. The party and the [[Naxalite]]s (as the rebels were called) were soon to get into a bloody feud.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh another revolt was taking place. There the pro-Naxalbari dissidents had not established any presence. But in the party organisation there were many veterans from the Telangana armed struggle, who rallied against the central party leadership. In Andhra Pradesh the radicals had a strong base even amongst the state-level leadership. The main leader of the radical tendency was [[T. Nagi Reddy]], a member of the state legislative assembly. On 15 June 1968 the leaders of the radical tendency published a press statement outlining the critique of the development of CPI(M). It was signed by T. Nagi Reddy, D.V. Rao, Kolla Venkaiah and [[Chandra Pulla Reddy]].<ref>This press statement was reproduced in full in the central CPI(M) publication, People's Democracy, on 30 June. P. Sundarayya and M. Basavapunniah, acting on behalf of the Polit Bureau of CPI(M), formulated a response to the statement on 16 June, titled 'Rebuff the Rebels, Uphold Party Unity'. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 48.</ref> In total around 50% of the party cadres in Andhra Pradesh left the party to form the [[Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]], under the leadership of T. Nagi Reddy.<ref>Some perceive that the Chinese leadership severely misjudged the actual conditions of different Indian factions at the time, giving their full support to the Majumdar-Sanyal group whilst keeping the Andhra Pradesh radicals (that had a considerable mass following) at distance.</ref>\n\n===Dismissal of United Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:United Front government.JPG|150px|thumbnail|United Front government]] -->\nIn November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by [[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]], but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state. After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President's Rule. CPI(M) launched agitations against the interventions of the central government in West Bengal.\n\nThe 8th Party Congress of CPI(M) was held in [[Cochin]], Kerala, on 23\u201329 December 1968. On 25 December 1968, whilst the congress was held, 42 [[Dalit]]s were burned alive in the Tamil village of [[Kizhavenmani]]. The massacre was a retaliation from landlords after Dalit labourers had taken part in a CPI(M)-led agitation for higher wages.<ref>[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm Dalits and land issues<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223113220/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm|date=23 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|title=Untitled-1<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023515/http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe United Front government in Kerala was forced out of office in October 1969, as the CPI, RSP, KTP and Muslim League ministers resigned.

Achutha Menon]] was formed, with the outside support of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\n===Elections in West Bengal and Kerala===\nFresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) contested 97 seats, and won 80. The party was now the largest in the West Bengal legislative.<ref>Indian National Congress had won 55 seats, Bangla Congress 33 and CPI 30.

Mukherjee resigned on 16 March 1970, after a pact had been reached between CPI, Bangla Congress and the Indian National Congress against CPI(M). CPI(M) strove to form a new government, instead but the central government put the state under President's Rule.\n\nIn Kerala, fresh elections were held in 1970. CPI(M) contested 73 seats and won 29. After the election Achutha Menon formed a new ministry, including ministers from the Indian National Congress.\n\n===Formation of CITU===\n{{Main|Centre of Indian Trade Unions}}\n[[File:Indian Marxist graffiti 2004.jpg|thumb|[[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]] mural for CPI(M) candidate [[Sujan Chakraborty]] in [[Jadavpur]]]]\n\n===Outbreak of war in East Pakistan===\nIn 1971 [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) declared its independence from [[Pakistan]]. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising. India intervened militarily and gave active backing to the [[Mukti Bahini|Bangladeshi rebels]]. Millions of Bangladeshi refugees sought shelter in India, especially in West Bengal.\n\nAt the time the radical sections of the Bangladeshi communist movement were divided into many [[Political factions|faction]]s. Whilst the pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] actively participated in the rebellion, the pro-China communist tendency found itself in a peculiar situation as China had sided with Pakistan in the war. In Calcutta, where many Bangladeshi leftists had sought refuge, CPI(M) worked to co-ordinate the efforts to create a new political organisation. In the fall of 1971 three small groups, which were all hosted by the CPI(M), came together to form the [[Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist)]]. The new party became the sister party of CPI(M) in Bangladesh.<ref>The same is also true for the [[Workers Party of Bangladesh]], which was formed in 1980 when BCP(L) merged with other groups. Although politically close, WPB can be said to have a more Maoist-oriented profile than CPI(M).</ref>\n\n==Political ideology and stances==\nThe Party Constitution currently in force was adopted at the Eighth Party Congress in December 1968.<ref name=\"CPI(M) Constitution\">[http://cpim.org/party-constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315084048/http://cpim.org/party-constitution |date=15 March 2015 }} Amended April 2015 at the 21st Party Congress, Kozhikode, India.

However, in between two party congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision making body<ref name=\"cpim-const\" />.\n{{Indcom}}\n{{Communist Parties}}\n\n==History==\n===Undivided Communist Party of India===\nCommunist Party of India(Marxist) emerged from a division within the undivided [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI), which was formed on 17 October 1920. The undivided CPI had experienced a period of upsurge during the years following the [[Second World War]]. The CPI led armed rebellions in [[Telangana Rebellion|Telangana]], [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]], and [[Kerala]]. However, it soon abandoned the strategy of armed revolution in favour of working within the [[parliamentary]] framework. In 1950, [[B. T. Ranadive]], the CPI general secretary and a prominent representative of the radical sector inside the party, was demoted on grounds of left-adventurism.\n\nUnder the government of the [[Indian National Congress]] party of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], independent India developed close relations and a strategic partnership with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet government consequently wished that the Indian communists moderate their criticism towards the Indian state and assume a supportive role towards the Congress governments. However, large sections of the CPI claimed that India remained a semi-[[feudal]] country, and that [[class struggle]] could not be put on the back-burner for the sake of guarding the interests of Soviet trade and foreign policy. Moreover, the Indian National Congress appeared to be generally hostile towards political competition. In 1959 the central government intervened to impose [[President's Rule]] in Kerala, toppling the [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]] cabinet (the sole non-Congress state government in the country).\n\n===Formation of CPI(M)===\nThe relations between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] soured, leading to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] around this time. In the early 1960s the Communist Party of China began criticising the CPSU of turning [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] and of deviating from the path of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. [[Sino-Indian relations]] also deteriorated, as border disputes between the two countries erupted into the [[Sino-Indian War of 1962]].\n\nThe basis of difference in opinion between the two factions in CPI was ideological \u2013 about the assessment of Indian scenario and the development of a party programme. This difference in opinion was also a reflection of a similar difference at international level on ideology between the Soviet and Chinese parties. The alleged 'right wing' inside the party followed the Soviet path and put forward the idea of joining hands with the then ruling party \u2013 Indian National Congress. Whereas the faction of CPI which later became CPI(M) referred to this as a revisionist approach of class collaboration. It was this ideological difference which later intensified, coupled with the Soviet-Chinese split at the international level and ultimately gave birth to CPI(M).<ref name=kozhikkodepartycongress>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|title=Communist Party in Kerala|publisher=CPI(M)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314030901/http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nHundreds of CPI leaders, accused of being pro-Chinese, were imprisoned. Thousands of Communists were detained without trial.<ref>The bulk of the detainees came from the left wing of the CPI. However, [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] of the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India]] and the [[Workers Party of India]] were also targeted.[http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017160748/http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref> Those targeted by the state accused the pro-Soviet leadership of the CPI of conspiring with the Congress government to ensure their own hegemony over the control of the party.\n\nIn 1962 [[Ajoy Ghosh]], the general secretary of the CPI, died. After his death, [[S.A. Dange]] was installed as the party chairman (a new position) and E.M.S. Namboodiripad as general secretary. This was an attempt to achieve a compromise. Dange represented the rightist faction of the party and E.M.S. the leftist faction.\n\nAt a CPI National Council meeting held on 11 April 1964, 32 Council members walked out in protest, accusing Dange and his followers of \"anti-unity and anti-Communist policies\".<ref>The 32 were [[P.

In this convention the issues of the internal disputes in the party were discussed. 146 delegates, claiming to represent 100,000 CPI members, took part in the proceedings. The convention decided to convene the 7th Party Congress of CPI in [[Calcutta]] later the same year.<ref name=\"basu51\">Basu, Pradip.

These radicals criticised the draft programme proposal prepared by [[M. Basavapunniah]] for undermining [[class struggle]] and failing to take a clear pro-Chinese position in the ideological conflict between the CPSU and CPC.<ref>Suniti Kumar Ghosh was a member of the group that presented this alternative draft proposal.

[[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 32.</ref>\n\nAfter the Tenali convention the CPI left wing organised party district and state conferences. In [[West Bengal]], a few of these meetings became battlegrounds between the most radical elements and the more moderate leadership. At the Calcutta Party District Conference an alternative draft programme was presented to the leadership by Parimal Das Gupta (a leading figure amongst far-left intellectuals in the party). Another alternative proposal was brought forward to the Calcutta Party District Conference by [[Aziz ul Haq]], but Haq was initially banned from presenting it by the conference organisers. At the Calcutta Party District Conference 42 delegates opposed M. Basavapunniah's official draft programme proposal.\n\nAt the Siliguri Party District Conference, the main draft proposal for a party programme was accepted, but with some additional points suggested by the far-left North Bengal cadre [[Charu Majumdar]]. However, [[Harekrishna Konar]] (representing the leadership of the CPI left wing) forbade the raising of the slogan ''Mao Tse-Tung Zindabad'' (Long live Mao Tse-Tung) at the conference.\n\nParimal Das Gupta's document was also presented to the leadership at the West Bengal State Conference of the CPI leftwing. Das Gupta and a few other spoke at the conference, demanding the party ought to adopt the class analysis of the Indian state of the 1951 CPI conference. His proposal was, however, voted down.<ref>Basu, Pradip. Towards Naxalbari (1953\u20131967) \u2013 An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle.

Simultaneously, the Dange group convened a Party Congress of CPI in [[Bombay]]. Thus, the CPI divided into two separate parties. The group which assembled in Calcutta would later adopt the name '[https://www.indianexitpoll.com/political-party/communist-party-of-india-marxist-cpi-m/ Communist Party of India (Marxist)]', to differentiate themselves from the Dange group. The CPI(M) also adopted its own political programme. [[P. Sundarayya]] was elected general secretary of the party.\n\nIn total 422 delegates took part in the Calcutta Congress. CPI(M) claimed that they represented 104,421 CPI members, 60% of the total party membership.\n\nAt the Calcutta conference the party adopted a class analysis of the character of the Indian state, that claimed the Indian [[bourgeoisie]] was increasingly collaborating with [[imperialism]].<ref name=autogenerated2>Basu, Pradip.

However, [[Souren Basu]], a delegate from the far-left stronghold [[Darjeeling]], spoke at the conference asking why no portrait had been raised of Mao Tse-Tung along the portraits of other communist stalwarts. His intervention met with huge applauses from the delegates of the conference .<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Name===\nCPI(M) is officially known as \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940(''Bharat ki Kamyunist Party Marksvadi'') in Hindi, but it is often known as \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 (''Marksvadi Kamyunist Party'', abbreviated ''MaKaPa'') in press and media circles. During its initial years after the split, the party was often referred by different names such as 'Left Communist Party' or 'Communist Party of India (Left)'. The party has used the name 'Left' because CPI people were dubbed as rightist in nature for their support to Congress-Nehru regime. During Kerala Legislative Assembly elections of 1965 the party has adopted the name '[https://www.indianexitpoll.com/political-party/communist-party-of-india-marxist-cpi-m/ Communist Party of India (Marxist)]' to obtain its election symbol from the Election Commission of India.<ref>[[Jyoti Basu|Basu, Jyoti]].

At the time of the holding of its Calcutta Congress, large sections of its leaders and cadres were jailed without trial. Again on 29\u201330 December, over a thousand CPI (M) cadres were arrested and detained, and held in jail without trial. In 1965 new waves of arrests of CPI(M) cadres took place in [[West Bengal]], as the party launched agitations against the rise in fares in the [[Calcutta Tramways]] and against the then prevailing food crisis. Statewide general strikes and [[hartal]]s were observed on 5 August 1965, 10\u201311 March 1966 and 6 April 1966. The March 1966 general strike results in several deaths in confrontations with police forces.\n\nAlso in Kerala, mass arrests of CPI(M) cadres were carried out during 1965. In [[Bihar]], the party called for a ''[[hartal|Bandh]]'' (general strike) in [[Patna]] on 9 August 1965 in protest against the Congress state government. During the strike, police resorted to violent actions against the organisers of the strike. The strike was followed by agitations in other parts of the state.\n\nP. Sundaraiah, after being released from jail, spent the period of September 1965 \u2013 February 1966 in Moscow for medical treatment. In Moscow he also held talks with the CPSU.<ref>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front \u2013 Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 17-18</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee of CPI(M) held its first meeting on 12\u201319 June 1966. The reason for delaying the holding of a regular CC meeting was the fact that several of the persons elected as CC members at the Calcutta Congress were jailed at the time.<ref>The jailed members of the new CC, at the time of the Calcutta Congress, were [[B.T. Ranadive]], Muzaffar Ahmed, Hare Krishna Konar and Promode Das Gupta. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 44-5.</ref> A CC meeting had been scheduled to have been held in [[Trichur]] during the last days of 1964, but had been cancelled due to the wave of arrests against the party. The meeting discussed tactics for electoral alliances, and concluded that the party should seek to form a broad electoral alliances with all non-reactionary opposition parties in West Bengal (i.e. all parties except Jan Sangh and Swatantra Party). This decision was strongly criticised by the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the radicals within the party itself. The line was changed at a National Council meeting in [[Jullunder]] in October 1966, where it was decided that the party should only form alliances with selected left parties.<ref>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front \u2013 Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''.[Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 234-235.</ref>\n\n===Naxalbari uprising===\n{{main|Naxalite}}\nAt this point the party stood at crossroads. There were radical sections of the party who were wary of the increasing parliamentary focus of the party leadership, especially after the electoral victories in West Bengal and Kerala. Developments in China also affected the situation inside the party. In West Bengal two separate internal dissident tendencies emerged, which both could be identified as supporting the Chinese line.<ref>According to Basu (in Basu, Pradip; Towards Naxalbari (1953\u201367) : An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 2000.) there were two nuclei of radicals in the party organisation in West Bengal. One \"theorist\" section around Parimal Das Gupta in Calcutta, which wanted to persuade the party leadership to correct revisionist mistakes through inner-party debate, and one \"actionist\" section led by [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]] in North Bengal. The 'actionists' were impatient, and strived to organize armed uprisings. According to Basu, due to the prevailing political climate of youth and student rebellion it was the 'actionists' which came to dominate the new Maoist movement in India, instead of the more theoretically advanced sections. This dichotomy is however rebuffed by followers of the radical stream, for example the [http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm CPI(ML) Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013802/http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}.</ref> In 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in [[Naxalbari]], in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]]. The hardliners within CPI(M) saw the Naxalbari uprising as the spark that would ignite the Indian revolution. The Communist Party of China hailed the Naxalbari movement, causing an abrupt break in CPI(M)-CPC relations.<ref>On 1 July ''[[People's Daily]]'' carried an article titled [http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm Spring Thunder Over India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223115803/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}, expressing the support of CPC to the Naxalbari rebels. At its meeting in [[Madurai]] on 18\u201327 August 1967, the Central Committee of CPI(M) adopted a resolution titled 'Resolution on Divergent Views Between Our Party and the Communist Party of China on Certain Fundamental Issues of Programme and Policy'. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 46.</ref> The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government, of which CPI(M) was a major partner. Within the party, the hardliners rallied around an [[All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]]. Following the 1968 [[Burdwan]] plenum of CPI(M) (held on 5\u201312 April 1968), the AICCCR separated themselves from CPI(M). This split divided the party throughout the country. But notably in West Bengal, which was the centre of the violent radicalist stream, no prominent leading figure left the party. The party and the [[Naxalite]]s (as the rebels were called) were soon to get into a bloody feud.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh another revolt was taking place. There the pro-Naxalbari dissidents had not established any presence. But in the party organisation there were many veterans from the Telangana armed struggle, who rallied against the central party leadership. In Andhra Pradesh the radicals had a strong base even amongst the state-level leadership. The main leader of the radical tendency was [[T. Nagi Reddy]], a member of the state legislative assembly. On 15 June 1968 the leaders of the radical tendency published a press statement outlining the critique of the development of CPI(M). It was signed by T. Nagi Reddy, D.V. Rao, Kolla Venkaiah and [[Chandra Pulla Reddy]].<ref>This press statement was reproduced in full in the central CPI(M) publication, People's Democracy, on 30 June. P. Sundarayya and M. Basavapunniah, acting on behalf of the Polit Bureau of CPI(M), formulated a response to the statement on 16 June, titled 'Rebuff the Rebels, Uphold Party Unity'.

Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 48.</ref> In total around 50% of the party cadres in Andhra Pradesh left the party to form the [[Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]], under the leadership of T. Nagi Reddy.<ref>Some perceive that the Chinese leadership severely misjudged the actual conditions of different Indian factions at the time, giving their full support to the Majumdar-Sanyal group whilst keeping the Andhra Pradesh radicals (that had a considerable mass following) at distance.</ref>\n\n===Dismissal of United Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:United Front government.JPG|150px|thumbnail|United Front government]] -->\nIn November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by [[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]], but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state. After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President's Rule. CPI(M) launched agitations against the interventions of the central government in West Bengal.\n\nThe 8th Party Congress of CPI(M) was held in [[Cochin]], Kerala, on 23\u201329 December 1968. On 25 December 1968, whilst the congress was held, 42 [[Dalit]]s were burned alive in the Tamil village of [[Kizhavenmani]]. The massacre was a retaliation from landlords after Dalit labourers had taken part in a CPI(M)-led agitation for higher wages.<ref>[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm Dalits and land issues<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223113220/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm|date=23 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|title=Untitled-1<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023515/http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe United Front government in Kerala was forced out of office in October 1969, as the CPI, RSP, KTP and Muslim League ministers resigned.

Mukherjee resigned on 16 March 1970, after a pact had been reached between CPI, Bangla Congress and the Indian National Congress against CPI(M). CPI(M) strove to form a new government, instead but the central government put the state under President's Rule.\n\nIn Kerala, fresh elections were held in 1970. CPI(M) contested 73 seats and won 29. After the election Achutha Menon formed a new ministry, including ministers from the Indian National Congress.\n\n===Formation of CITU===\n{{Main|Centre of Indian Trade Unions}}\n[[File:Indian Marxist graffiti 2004.jpg|thumb|[[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]] mural for CPI(M) candidate [[Sujan Chakraborty]] in [[Jadavpur]]]]\n\n===Outbreak of war in East Pakistan===\nIn 1971 [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) declared its independence from [[Pakistan]]. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising. India intervened militarily and gave active backing to the [[Mukti Bahini|Bangladeshi rebels]]. Millions of Bangladeshi refugees sought shelter in India, especially in West Bengal.\n\nAt the time the radical sections of the Bangladeshi communist movement were divided into many [[Political factions|faction]]s. Whilst the pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] actively participated in the rebellion, the pro-China communist tendency found itself in a peculiar situation as China had sided with Pakistan in the war. In Calcutta, where many Bangladeshi leftists had sought refuge, CPI(M) worked to co-ordinate the efforts to create a new political organisation. In the fall of 1971 three small groups, which were all hosted by the CPI(M), came together to form the [[Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist)]]. The new party became the sister party of CPI(M) in Bangladesh.<ref>The same is also true for the [[Workers Party of Bangladesh]], which was formed in 1980 when BCP(L) merged with other groups. Although politically close, WPB can be said to have a more Maoist-oriented profile than CPI(M).</ref>\n\n==Political ideology and stances==\nThe Party Constitution currently in force was adopted at the Eighth Party Congress in December 1968.<ref name=\"CPI(M) Constitution\">[http://cpim.org/party-constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315084048/http://cpim.org/party-constitution |date=15 March 2015 }} Amended April 2015 at the 21st Party Congress, Kozhikode, India.

The genus is a valuable one, since its species are not only of considerable medicinal value, being rich in [[tropane]] alkaloids, but also of [[Ornamental plant|ornamental]] value, three species having been grown for the purpose, although hitherto infrequently outside [[botanical garden]]s. Furthermore, the genus contains a species (''P. physaloides'' \u2013 recorded in older literature under the synonyms ''Hyoscyamus physalodes'', ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' and ''Scopolia physaloides'') formerly used as an [[entheogen]] in Siberia (re. which see translation of [[Johann Georg Gmelin|Gmelin's]] account of such use below).<ref>R\u00e4tsch, Christian, ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications'' pub.

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' L. and ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' M. Bieb. \u2013 the latter published by Baron [[Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein]] in his ''Flora taurico-caucasica'' of 1808.\n\n==Common names==\nNot being native to Western Europe, plants belonging to the genus ''Physochlaina'' have no common name of any antiquity in English, nor have they acquired a more recent common name among English-speaking gardeners, despite the passage of two centuries since their introduction to cultivation in the U.K.\n\n[[Robert Sweet (botanist)|Robert Sweet]] coined the English name ''Oriental Henbane'' for ''P. orientalis'' in his work ''The British Flower Garden'' in 1823, but this is simply a translation of the ( now obsolete ) name ''Hyoscyamus orientalis''. He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] ) </ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

This Ossetian common name for the plant is thus very similar in meaning to the Russian ''Puzeernitsa'', but it is not clear whether it arose independently or is simply a translation of the Russian name for the plant. This said, [[Vasily Abaev|Abaev]] lists a second meaning (prevalent particularly in the [[Digor dialect]]) of the Ossetian word ''typpyr'', namely '[[kurgan]]' (burial mound), in which the primary sense of 'swelling' is applied specifically to a swelling in the landscape i.e. a [[tumulus]] or small artificial hill. It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds. Such a meaning for this compound would be compatible with a native Ossetian provenance - not unlikely in regard to the name of a plant native to the Caucasus (see below re.

The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<Blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</Blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<Blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.</Blockquote><ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels.

It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref>, publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia|Prussian]] botanist, zoologist and ethnographer [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), straddling border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Pallas en differentes provinces de l'Empire de Russie et dans l'Asie septentrionale, traduit de l'Allemande par m. Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref> Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote/>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref>, page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''.

In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973. <ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia|Western Asian]] ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21 2014 1.50pm.

[See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( ten days ) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( eleven days ) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( twelve days ) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( thirteen days ) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838.

He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] ) </ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub. Elsevier.</ref>\n\nThe nomenclatural association of ''P. infundibularis'' with Mount Hua \u2013 'West Great Mountain' of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Great Mountains of China]] of [[Taoism]] \u2013  is an interesting one and merits further study : in common with other mountains regarded in China as [[numinous]]/[[Xian ling]], Mount Hua (a precipitous assemblage of five (counted anciently only as three) peaks in the [[Qin Mountains|Qin range]]) is held to be a source of rare medicinal plants and life-prolonging [[Elixir of life|elixirs]]. Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

In the traditional systems of medicine in China and Mongolia it is considered to have the effects of 'combatting weakness', 'warming up the [[stomach]]', 'soothing the mental condition' and relieving asthma. It is also used for treating 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold' and 'cough or asthma caused by excessive [[phlegm]] or [[neurasthenia]]'.\nNote : the medical concept neurasthenia \u2013 now largely abandoned in Western medicine \u2013 is expressed in Chinese as ''shenjing shuairuo'' (simplified Chinese: \u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u5f31), a compound of ''shenjing'' 'nervous' and ''shuairuo'' 'weakness', and the Chinese condition so described is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] encompassing debility, emotional turmoil, excitement, tension-induced pain and sleep disturbances, caused by a depletion of [[qi]] ('vital energy') and impaired functioning of the [[Zang-fu#Five System|''wuzang'']] (= 'five vital organs').<ref>Schwartz, Pamela Yew (September 2002). \"Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures?\".

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<Blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</Blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<Blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.</Blockquote><ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref>, publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia|Prussian]] botanist, zoologist and ethnographer [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), straddling border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides'').

The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref> Winston, Robert, ed.

New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests rather a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote/>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref>, page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]]. \n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973. <ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia|Western Asian]] ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21 2014 1.50pm.

[See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( ten days ) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( eleven days ) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( twelve days ) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( thirteen days ) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.
