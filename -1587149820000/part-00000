Their apartment's handyman is an eccentric, but kind and humble [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawan]] immigrant named [[Mr. Miyagi]].\n\nDaniel befriends [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]], a high school cheerleader, which draws the attention of her arrogant ex-boyfriend [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]], a black belt and the top student from the \"Cobra Kai\" dojo, where he studies a vicious form of karate. Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang continually [[bullying|bully]] Daniel. On Halloween, after Daniel sprays water on Johnny with a hose, he and his gang pursue Daniel down the street and savagely beat him, until Mr. Miyagi intervenes and single-handedly defeats them with ease. Amazed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate. Miyagi declines but agrees to bring Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo to resolve the conflict. They meet with the sensei, [[John Kreese]], an ex-[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the All-Valley Karate Championships, where he can compete with Johnny and the other Cobra Kai students on equal terms, and requests that the bullying cease while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will continue for both Daniel and Miyagi.\n\nDaniel's training starts with days of menial chores that he believes only serve to make him Miyagi's slave. When he becomes frustrated, Miyagi demonstrates that repetition of these chores have helped him to learn defensive blocks through [[muscle memory]]. Their bond develops, and Miyagi opens up to Daniel about his life that includes the dual loss of his wife and son in childbirth at the [[Manzanar]] [[internment camp]] while he was serving with the [[442nd Infantry Regiment]] during [[World War II]] in Europe, where he received the [[Medal of Honor]]. Through Mr. Miyagi's teaching, Daniel learns not only karate, but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons that Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. On Daniel's birthday, Miyagi presents him with a [[Karate gi]] for the tournament and one of his own cars as birthday gifts.\n\nAt the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against Darryl Vidal. Kreese instructs his second-best student, Bobby Brown, who is one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting himself disqualified in the process. Daniel is taken to the locker room, where the physician determines that he cannot continue; however, Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He convinces Miyagi to use a [[reiki|pain suppression technique]] to allow him to continue. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel returns to fight. The match is a seesaw battle, with neither able to break through the other's defense.\n\nThe match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor-leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of the head and giving Johnny a nosebleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel's injured leg \u2013 an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order but reluctantly agrees. As the match resumes, Johnny seizes Daniel's leg and deals a vicious elbow, doing further damage. Daniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the \"Crane\" stance, a technique he observed Mr. Miyagi performing on a beach. Johnny lunges toward Daniel, who jumps and executes a front kick to Johnny's face, winning the tournament. Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his nemesis, presents the trophy to Daniel himself, as Daniel is carried off by an enthusiastic crowd.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]]\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] \n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Chad McQueen]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]] \n* Ron Thomas as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby Brown]] \n* [[Rob Garrison]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]] \n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]]\n* [[Andrew Shue]] (uncredited) as Peter (Cobra Kai student, defeated by Daryl Vidal @ All Valley Tournament)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Karate Kid'' is a semi-autobiographical story based on the life of its screenwriter, [[Robert Mark Kamen]].

Their apartment's handyman is an eccentric, but kind and humble [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawan]] immigrant named [[Mr. Miyagi]].\n\nDaniel befriends [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]], a high school cheerleader, which draws the attention of her arrogant ex-boyfriend [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]], a black belt and the top student from the \"Cobra Kai\" dojo, where he studies a vicious form of karate. Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang continually [[bullying|bully]] Daniel. On Halloween, after Daniel sprays water on Johnny with a hose, he and his gang pursue Daniel down the street and savagely beat him, until Mr. Miyagi intervenes and single-handedly defeats them with ease. Amazed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate. Miyagi declines but agrees to bring Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo to resolve the conflict. They meet with the sensei, [[John Kreese]], an ex-[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the All-Valley Karate Championships, where he can compete with Johnny and the other Cobra Kai students on equal terms, and requests that the bullying cease while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will continue for both Daniel and Miyagi.\n\nDaniel's training starts with days of menial chores that he believes only serve to make him Miyagi's slave. When he becomes frustrated, Miyagi demonstrates that repetition of these chores have helped him to learn defensive blocks through [[muscle memory]]. Their bond develops, and Miyagi opens up to Daniel about his life that includes the dual loss of his wife and son in childbirth at the [[Manzanar]] [[internment camp]] while he was serving with the [[442nd Infantry Regiment]] during [[World War II]] in Europe, where he received the [[Medal of Honor]]. Through Mr. Miyagi's teaching, Daniel learns not only karate, but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons that Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. On Daniel's birthday, Miyagi presents him with a [[Karate gi]] for the tournament and one of his own cars as birthday gifts.\n\nAt the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against Darryl Vidal. Kreese instructs his second-best student, Bobby Brown, who is one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting himself disqualified in the process. Daniel is taken to the locker room, where the physician determines that he cannot continue; however, Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He convinces Miyagi to use a [[reiki|pain suppression technique]] to allow him to continue. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel returns to fight. The match is a seesaw battle, with neither able to break through the other's defense.\n\nThe match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor-leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of the head and giving Johnny a nosebleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel's injured leg \u2013 an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order but reluctantly agrees. As the match resumes, Johnny seizes Daniel's leg and deals a vicious elbow, doing further damage. Daniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the \"Crane\" stance, a technique he observed Mr. Miyagi performing on a beach. Johnny lunges toward Daniel, who jumps and executes a front kick to Johnny's face, winning the tournament. Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his nemesis, presents the trophy to Daniel himself, as Daniel is carried off by an enthusiastic crowd.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]]\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] \n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Chad McQueen]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]] \n* Ron Thomas as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby Brown]] \n* [[Rob Garrison]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]] \n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]]\n* [[Andrew Shue]] (uncredited) as Peter (Cobra Kai student, defeated by Daryl Vidal @ All Valley Tournament)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Karate Kid'' is a semi-autobiographical story based on the life of its screenwriter, [[Robert Mark Kamen]].

Marshes, for example, are turning to open water, and cypress swamps are being killed by salt water intrusion. However, brown pelicans and bald eagles, once scarce, are now a common sight along the shores. A team of experts assembled by [[The Nature Conservancy]] assessed the situation in 2004.<ref>Maygarden, D. and others. 2004. Conservation Area Plan for the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary. The Nature Conservancy, LA.</ref> They identified seven target habitat types that were in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation.  The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as [[Chinese tallow]] while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as [[Colocasia esculenta|elephant's-ear]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The team also identified four key animal species that could indicate the degree to which the system declines or improves.  These were rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), [[gulf sturgeon]] and paddlefish (representing fish communities) and the [[alligator snapping turtle]] (one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, but in decline owing to over-harvesting). The future of the lake depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin, and controlling urban sprawl on the North shore.  Selected species, like the paddlefish and alligator snapping turtle, would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning.  A few examples of future change might include more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh.<ref>Keddy, P.A., D.

It includes the cities of [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]], [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], [[Abita Springs, Louisiana|Abita Springs]],  [[Madisonville, Louisiana|Madisonville]], [[Lacombe, Louisiana|Lacombe]], and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] in [[Saint Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]]; [[Ponchatoula, Louisiana|Ponchatoula]], [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], and [[Amite, Louisiana|Amite]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]]; and [[Franklinton, Louisiana|Franklinton]] in [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]].\n\nThese three Northshore parishes are the eastern [[Florida Parishes]]. The landscape here is mostly uplands that were once dominated by [[long leaf pine]] [[savanna]]s and interrupted by occasional large [[river]]s.  The savannas were maintained by regular fires caused by lightning; they produced the distinctive fauna and flora of this region.<ref name=\"Keddy, P.A 2008\"/>\n\n{{anchor|South Shore|Eastbank|Westbank}} \nLake Pontchartrain's south shore areas (dominated by [[New Orleans]]), instead of being designated by that name, are more likely to be referred to as either \"East bank\" or \"West bank,\" depending upon their position with respect to the general north\u2013south course of the [[Mississippi River]]. Lake Pontchartrain forms the northern boundary of the city of New Orleans, which is coterminous with [[Orleans Parish]], and the northern boundary of its two largest suburbs [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] and [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]]; as well as forming the northern boundaries of [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|Saint Charles Parish]] and much of the northern and eastern boundaries of [[St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana|Saint John the Baptist Parish]].\n\n== New Orleans ==\nNew Orleans was established at a Native American [[portage]] between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. The lake provides numerous recreational activities for people in New Orleans and is also home to the [[Southern Yacht Club]]. In the 1920s, the [[Industrial Canal]] in the eastern part of the city opened, providing a direct navigable water connection, with [[canal lock|locks]], between the Mississippi River and the lake. In the same decade, a project [[dredging]] new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between Metairie/Gentilly Ridges and the lakefront. The [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, connecting New Orleans (by way of Metairie) with Mandeville, and bisecting the lake in a north-northeast line.\n\n== Hurricanes ==\n[[Image:Lake Pontchartrain Georges.jpg|thumb|300px|Lake Pontchartrain at [[New Orleans]] during [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998; lakefront fishing camps outside of the protection [[levee]] suffered severe damage.]]\nDuring [[hurricane]]s, a [[storm surge]] can build up in Lake Pontchartrain. Wind pushes water into the lake from the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane approaches from the south, and from there it can spill into New Orleans.\n\nA [[Great Fort Lauderdale hurricane|hurricane in 1947]] flooded much of [[Metairie]], much of which is slightly below sea level due to land subsidence after marshland was drained. After the storm, hurricane-protection [[levee]]s were built along Lake Pontchartrain's south shore to protect New Orleans and nearby communities. A storm surge of {{convert|10|ft}} from [[Hurricane Betsy]] overwhelmed some levees in [[eastern New Orleans]] in 1965, while storm surge funneled in by the [[Mississippi River\u2013Gulf Outlet Canal]] and a levee failure flooded most of the [[Lower 9th Ward]]. After this the levees encircling the city and outlying [[county (United States)|parishes]] were raised to heights of {{convert|14|to|23|ft}}. Due to cost concerns, the levees were built to protect against only a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale#Categories|Category 3 hurricane]]; however, some of the levees initially withstood the [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|Category 5 storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (August 2005), which only slowed to Category 3 winds within hours of landfall (due to a last-minute [[eyewall replacement cycle]]).\n\nExperts using computer modeling at [[Louisiana State University]] after Hurricane Katrina have concluded that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, or some combination of the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans: some canal walls leaked underneath, because the wall foundations were not deep enough in peat-subsoil to withstand the pressure of higher water.<ref>{{cite news\n| last =Grunwall\n| first =Michael\n| authorlink =\n|author2=[[Susan Glasser|Glasser, Susan B.]] \n | date= September 21, 2005\n| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001894_pf.html\n| title =Experts Say Faulty Levees Caused Much of Flooding\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =washingtonpost.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n[[Congress of the United States|Congress]] failed to fully fund an upgrade requested during the 1990s by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], and funding was cut in 2003\u201304 despite a 2001 study by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] warning that a hurricane in New Orleans was one of the country's three most likely disasters.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Blumenthal\n| first =Sidney \n| authorlink =\n| date= August 31, 2005\n| url =http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2005/08/31/disaster_preparation/\n| title =No one can say they didn't see it coming\n| format =\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =Salon.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref> Raising and reinforcing the levees to resist a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale#Categories|Category 5 hurricane]] might take 25 years to complete.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Handwerk\n| first =Brian\n| authorlink =\n| date= September 2, 2005\n| url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0902_050902_katrina_levees.html\n| title =New Orleans Levees Not Built for Worst Case Events\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =National Geographic News\n| language =\n| accessdate =\n}}</ref> Some estimates place the cost at $25 billion.\n\n=== Hurricane Katrina ===\n[[Image:Hurricane Katrina winds 1200utc29Aug05 landfall LA 1hr.gif|right |thumb|260px| Windspeed of [[Hurricane Katrina]] 7 a.m., showing hurricane-force winds (yellow/brown/red: 75-92 mph) hitting the northeast\u2013south shores of Lake Pontchartrain (1 hour after landfall) on August 29, 2005.]]\n\n[[Image:Hurricane Katrina winds 1500utc29Aug05 landfall MS.gif|right|thumb|260px| Windspeed of Hurricane Katrina 10 a.m., showing hurricane-force winds (yellow/brown) still hitting the north\u2013southeast shores of Lake Pontchartrain (4 hours after landfall)]]\n\nWhen [[Hurricane Katrina]] reached Category 5 in 2005, some experts predicted that the levee system might fail completely if the storm passed close to the city. Although Katrina weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall on August 29 (with only Category 1-2 strength winds in New Orleans on the weaker side of the eye of the hurricane), the outlying [[New Orleans East]] area along south Lake Pontchartrain was in the eyewall with winds, preceding the eye, nearly as strong as those experienced in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]].  Canals near [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] began leaking at 8 am,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and some levees/canals, designed to withstand Category 3 storms, suffered multiple breaks the following day (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]), flooding 80% of the city.\n\nThe walls of the [[Industrial Canal]] were breached by storm surge via the [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]], while the [[17th Street Canal]] and [[London Avenue Canal]] experienced catastrophic breaches, even though water levels never topped their flood walls. [[Louisiana State University]] experts presented evidence that some of these structures might have had design flaws or faulty construction.<ref>{{cite news\n| last =Grunwald\n| first =Michael \n| authorlink =\n|author2=Glasser, Susan B.\n | date= September 21, 2005\n| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001894_pf.html\n| title =Experts Say Faulty Levees Caused Much of Flooding\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =washingtonpost.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are indications that the soft earth and [[peat]] underlying canal walls may have given way. In the weeks before Katrina, tests of [[salinity]] in [[seepage]] pools near canals showed them to be lake water, not [[fresh water]] from broken mains. The {{convert|5.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] heading northeast between New Orleans and Slidell was destroyed. The shorter [[Fort Pike]] Bridge crossing the outlet to Lake Borgne remained intact.\n\nMuch of the northern sector of the suburban areas of Metairie and Kenner was flooded with up to {{convert|2|to|3|ft|1}} of water. In this area, flooding was not the result of levee overtopping, but was due to a decision by the governmental administration of Jefferson Parish to abandon the levee-aligned drainage pumping stations.<ref>[http://blog.nola.com/kenner/2008/01/broussard_says_he_didnt_send_p.html Broussard says he didn't send pump operators away - Kenner Bulletin - NOLA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429192004/http://blog.nola.com/kenner/2008/01/broussard_says_he_didnt_send_p.html |date=2008-04-29 }}.</ref> This resulted in the reverse flow of lake water through the pumping stations into drainage canals which subsequently overflowed, causing extensive flooding of the area between I-10 and the lakefront.

The London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal were blocked at the lake as permanent repairs started. On September 6, the Corps began pumping flood water back into the lake after seven days in the streets of New Orleans. Because it was fouled with dead animals, sewage, [[heavy metals]], [[petrochemical]]s, and other dangerous substances, the Army Corps worked with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) to avoid major contamination and [[eutrophication]] of the lake.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = USACE\n|date= September 2005\n| url = http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/katrina/environment.html\n| title = Quick, coordinated efforts reduce environmental impact on Lake Pontchartrain\n| publisher = usace.army.mil\n| accessdate =2007-07-03\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070513100958/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/katrina/environment.html |archivedate = May 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAerial photography suggests that {{convert|25|e9USgal|m3}} of water covered New Orleans as of September 2, which equals about 2% of Lake Pontchartrain's volume.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Due to a lack of electric power, the city was unable to treat the water before pumping it into the lake.

Marshes, for example, are turning to open water, and cypress swamps are being killed by salt water intrusion. However, brown pelicans and bald eagles, once scarce, are now a common sight along the shores. A team of experts assembled by [[The Nature Conservancy]] assessed the situation in 2004.<ref>Maygarden, D. and others. 2004. Conservation Area Plan for the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary. The Nature Conservancy, LA.</ref> They identified seven target habitat types that were in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation.  The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as [[Chinese tallow]] while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as [[Colocasia esculenta|elephant's-ear]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The team also identified four key animal species that could indicate the degree to which the system declines or improves.  These were rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), [[gulf sturgeon]] and paddlefish (representing fish communities) and the [[alligator snapping turtle]] (one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, but in decline owing to over-harvesting). The future of the lake depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin, and controlling urban sprawl on the North shore.  Selected species, like the paddlefish and alligator snapping turtle, would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning.  A few examples of future change might include more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh.<ref>Keddy, P.A., D.

It includes the cities of [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]], [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], [[Abita Springs, Louisiana|Abita Springs]],  [[Madisonville, Louisiana|Madisonville]], [[Lacombe, Louisiana|Lacombe]], and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] in [[Saint Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]]; [[Ponchatoula, Louisiana|Ponchatoula]], [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], and [[Amite, Louisiana|Amite]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]]; and [[Franklinton, Louisiana|Franklinton]] in [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]].\n\nThese three Northshore parishes are the eastern [[Florida Parishes]]. The landscape here is mostly uplands that were once dominated by [[long leaf pine]] [[savanna]]s and interrupted by occasional large [[river]]s.  The savannas were maintained by regular fires caused by lightning; they produced the distinctive fauna and flora of this region.<ref name=\"Keddy, P.A 2008\"/>\n\n{{anchor|South Shore|Eastbank|Westbank}} \nLake Pontchartrain's south shore areas (dominated by [[New Orleans]]), instead of being designated by that name, are more likely to be referred to as either \"East bank\" or \"West bank,\" depending upon their position with respect to the general north\u2013south course of the [[Mississippi River]]. Lake Pontchartrain forms the northern boundary of the city of New Orleans, which is coterminous with [[Orleans Parish]], and the northern boundary of its two largest suburbs [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] and [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]]; as well as forming the northern boundaries of [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|Saint Charles Parish]] and much of the northern and eastern boundaries of [[St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana|Saint John the Baptist Parish]].\n\n== New Orleans ==\nNew Orleans was established at a Native American [[portage]] between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. The lake provides numerous recreational activities for people in New Orleans and is also home to the [[Southern Yacht Club]]. In the 1920s, the [[Industrial Canal]] in the eastern part of the city opened, providing a direct navigable water connection, with [[canal lock|locks]], between the Mississippi River and the lake. In the same decade, a project [[dredging]] new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between Metairie/Gentilly Ridges and the lakefront. The [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, connecting New Orleans (by way of Metairie) with Mandeville, and bisecting the lake in a north-northeast line.\n\n== Hurricanes ==\n[[Image:Lake Pontchartrain Georges.jpg|thumb|300px|Lake Pontchartrain at [[New Orleans]] during [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998; lakefront fishing camps outside of the protection [[levee]] suffered severe damage.]]\nDuring [[hurricane]]s, a [[storm surge]] can build up in Lake Pontchartrain. Wind pushes water into the lake from the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane approaches from the south, and from there it can spill into New Orleans.\n\nA [[Great Fort Lauderdale hurricane|hurricane in 1947]] flooded much of [[Metairie]], much of which is slightly below sea level due to land subsidence after marshland was drained. After the storm, hurricane-protection [[levee]]s were built along Lake Pontchartrain's south shore to protect New Orleans and nearby communities. A storm surge of {{convert|10|ft}} from [[Hurricane Betsy]] overwhelmed some levees in [[eastern New Orleans]] in 1965, while storm surge funneled in by the [[Mississippi River\u2013Gulf Outlet Canal]] and a levee failure flooded most of the [[Lower 9th Ward]]. After this the levees encircling the city and outlying [[county (United States)|parishes]] were raised to heights of {{convert|14|to|23|ft}}. Due to cost concerns, the levees were built to protect against only a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale#Categories|Category 3 hurricane]]; however, some of the levees initially withstood the [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|Category 5 storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (August 2005), which only slowed to Category 3 winds within hours of landfall (due to a last-minute [[eyewall replacement cycle]]).\n\nExperts using computer modeling at [[Louisiana State University]] after Hurricane Katrina have concluded that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, or some combination of the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans: some canal walls leaked underneath, because the wall foundations were not deep enough in peat-subsoil to withstand the pressure of higher water.<ref>{{cite news\n| last =Grunwall\n| first =Michael\n| authorlink =\n|author2=[[Susan Glasser|Glasser, Susan B.]] \n | date= September 21, 2005\n| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001894_pf.html\n| title =Experts Say Faulty Levees Caused Much of Flooding\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =washingtonpost.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n[[Congress of the United States|Congress]] failed to fully fund an upgrade requested during the 1990s by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], and funding was cut in 2003\u201304 despite a 2001 study by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] warning that a hurricane in New Orleans was one of the country's three most likely disasters.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Blumenthal\n| first =Sidney \n| authorlink =\n| date= August 31, 2005\n| url =http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2005/08/31/disaster_preparation/\n| title =No one can say they didn't see it coming\n| format =\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =Salon.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref> Raising and reinforcing the levees to resist a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale#Categories|Category 5 hurricane]] might take 25 years to complete.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Handwerk\n| first =Brian\n| authorlink =\n| date= September 2, 2005\n| url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0902_050902_katrina_levees.html\n| title =New Orleans Levees Not Built for Worst Case Events\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =National Geographic News\n| language =\n| accessdate =\n}}</ref> Some estimates place the cost at $25 billion.\n\n=== Hurricane Katrina ===\n[[Image:Hurricane Katrina winds 1200utc29Aug05 landfall LA 1hr.gif|right |thumb|260px| Windspeed of [[Hurricane Katrina]] 7 a.m., showing hurricane-force winds (yellow/brown/red: 75-92 mph) hitting the northeast\u2013south shores of Lake Pontchartrain (1 hour after landfall) on August 29, 2005.]]\n\n[[Image:Hurricane Katrina winds 1500utc29Aug05 landfall MS.gif|right|thumb|260px| Windspeed of Hurricane Katrina 10 a.m., showing hurricane-force winds (yellow/brown) still hitting the north\u2013southeast shores of Lake Pontchartrain (4 hours after landfall)]]\n\nWhen [[Hurricane Katrina]] reached Category 5 in 2005, some experts predicted that the levee system might fail completely if the storm passed close to the city. Although Katrina weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall on August 29 (with only Category 1-2 strength winds in New Orleans on the weaker side of the eye of the hurricane), the outlying [[New Orleans East]] area along south Lake Pontchartrain was in the eyewall with winds, preceding the eye, nearly as strong as those experienced in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]].  Canals near [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] began leaking at 8 am,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and some levees/canals, designed to withstand Category 3 storms, suffered multiple breaks the following day (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]), flooding 80% of the city.\n\nThe walls of the [[Industrial Canal]] were breached by storm surge via the [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]], while the [[17th Street Canal]] and [[London Avenue Canal]] experienced catastrophic breaches, even though water levels never topped their flood walls. [[Louisiana State University]] experts presented evidence that some of these structures might have had design flaws or faulty construction.<ref>{{cite news\n| last =Grunwald\n| first =Michael \n| authorlink =\n|author2=Glasser, Susan B.\n | date= September 21, 2005\n| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001894_pf.html\n| title =Experts Say Faulty Levees Caused Much of Flooding\n| work =\n| pages =\n| publisher =washingtonpost.com\n| language =\n| accessdate =2006-06-15\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are indications that the soft earth and [[peat]] underlying canal walls may have given way.

The shorter [[Fort Pike]] Bridge crossing the outlet to Lake Borgne remained intact.\n\nMuch of the northern sector of the suburban areas of Metairie and Kenner was flooded with up to {{convert|2|to|3|ft|1}} of water. In this area, flooding was not the result of levee overtopping, but was due to a decision by the governmental administration of Jefferson Parish to abandon the levee-aligned drainage pumping stations.<ref>[http://blog.nola.com/kenner/2008/01/broussard_says_he_didnt_send_p.html Broussard says he didn't send pump operators away - Kenner Bulletin - NOLA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429192004/http://blog.nola.com/kenner/2008/01/broussard_says_he_didnt_send_p.html |date=2008-04-29 }}.</ref> This resulted in the reverse flow of lake water through the pumping stations into drainage canals which subsequently overflowed, causing extensive flooding of the area between I-10 and the lakefront.

The London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal were blocked at the lake as permanent repairs started. On September 6, the Corps began pumping flood water back into the lake after seven days in the streets of New Orleans. Because it was fouled with dead animals, sewage, [[heavy metals]], [[petrochemical]]s, and other dangerous substances, the Army Corps worked with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) to avoid major contamination and [[eutrophication]] of the lake.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = USACE\n|date= September 2005\n| url = http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/katrina/environment.html\n| title = Quick, coordinated efforts reduce environmental impact on Lake Pontchartrain\n| publisher = usace.army.mil\n| accessdate =2007-07-03\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070513100958/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/katrina/environment.html |archivedate = May 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAerial photography suggests that {{convert|25|e9USgal|m3}} of water covered New Orleans as of September 2, which equals about 2% of Lake Pontchartrain's volume.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Due to a lack of electric power, the city was unable to treat the water before pumping it into the lake.

It was also adopted by [[ICAO]], with some modifications, as the civilian [[air traffic control]] (ATC) [[secondary radar]] (SSR) transponder. The X in the name does not mean \"tenth\", but \"eXperimental\".{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} Later IFF models acted as if it was the tenth in the series and used subsequent numbers.\n\nFor most of [[World War II]] the standard IFF system used by the allied air forces was the [[IFF Mark III]]. Mark III responded on the same frequency as the trigger signal, returning a selected pulse pattern. Originally, the Mark X was simply a version of Mark III operating at a higher frequency, which has several practical advantages. Three return patterns, or Modes, were available. As it was being introduced, the new '''Selective Identification Feature''', or '''SIF''', allowed the response signal to be modified with bit encoding, providing the ability for each aircraft to produce a unique response using [[octal]] digits. This was initially handled through a separate box that connected to the original Mark X. For a brief time in 1957 this was known as '''IFF Mark XI''' before becoming '''IFF Mark X (SIF)'''.\n\nAs the [[civil aviation]] market grew in the 1950s, Mark X was selected as the standard transponder system as the '''Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System''', or '''ATCRBS'''. For this role, a new series of four Modes was introduced, A through D. A is essentially identical to Mode 3, and these are now referred to as Mode 3/A. Mode C responds with a four-digit code encoding the [[pressure altitude]] in {{convert|100|foot}} increments. Combining information from a [[radar]] with Mode A and C responses, the ATC system can build a complete picture of the airspace without the need for [[height finder]]s or [[3D radar]]s. Using Mark X for the civilian role also allowed existing military users to be routed within the civilian network, as well as allowing civilian aircraft to use an existing and well-tested transponder design.\n\nMark X retained a key problem that was present in all IFF systems to date; the aircraft transponder would respond to any interrogation signal on the proper frequency with no way to tell if it was a friendly transmitter. This allows an enemy force to query the transponders and use [[triangulation]] to determine their location, or simply count the responses to look for increased activity. Military users had long desired a system that encoded both the interrogation and response, allowing the transponders to ignore signals from interrogators that did not present the right code. This led to the development of [[IFF Mark XII]] and its associated Mode 4 which began to be deployed in 1970.\n\n==History==\n===Mark III===\n{{main|IFF Mark III}}\n\nThe first IFF system to see widespread multinational use was the British [[IFF Mark III]], which appeared in early 1942 with the [[Royal Air Force]] and then used for the rest of the war by the US and Canada as well.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} This was a simple system that listened for broadcasts on a narrow band of frequencies, amplified the incoming signal using a [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative receiver]], and rebroadcast the result.{{sfn|AP1093D|1947|loc=117}} The regenerative design was extremely simple, often consisting of a single [[vacuum tube]]. The ground station used an \"interrogator\" to send out pulses in synchronicity with a [[radar]] unit, and mixed the received signal into the one from the radar to produce a unified display. On most [[radar display]]s, the IFF signal would lengthen the \"blip\" or cause additional blips to appear.{{sfn|AP1093D|1947|loc=Chapter 6}}\n\nMark III had the serious limitation that it would respond to signals from any broadcast in the 176&nbsp;MHz range. It was long feared that the Germans would send out their own interrogation pulses and then use a [[radio direction finder]] to locate the aircraft. The British did this to German [[night fighter]]s using a system known as [[Perfectos]],{{sfn|Price|2005|p=229}} forcing the Germans to turn off their IFFs and causing many [[friendly fire]] incidents. It seemed logical that the Germans would return the favour, but this was rarely the case; while ground-based radio reconnaissance units were known to track British aircraft by their IFF on occasion,{{sfn|Price|2005|p=178}} their success was greatly mitigated by turning the IFF transponder off while over enemy airspace.{{sfn|Price|2005|p=222}} The Germans could not do the same, as they were almost always flying over their own airspace.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a215411.pdf |title=Electronic Combat Over the Third Reich |first=Stephen |last=Fraley |date=11 December 1989 |publisher=Air Command and Staff College}}</ref>\n\nA more practical concern was that the IFF signals were in the middle of existing [[VHF]] radar bands; moving to a new frequency would help reduce potential interference. Moving to a higher frequency would have the added advantage of allowing the use of smaller antennas. Another issue with Mark III was that the transponder responded on the same frequency as the interrogation pulse, so other IFFs might hear the response signal and trigger their own, resulting in cascade of replies. This was particularly problematic near airports, where aircraft clustered and could hear each other's signals. Using separate send and receive frequencies would solve this, but the regenerative design worked by [[feedback|feeding back]] a received signal.<ref name=\"Poole\">{{cite book |last=Poole |first=Ian |title=Basic Radio: Principles and Technology |publisher=Newnes |date=1998 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaUGlb_Gd18C&pg=PA100 |isbn=0080938469}}</ref>\n\n===US efforts, Mark IV===\nThe [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) had also been considering the IFF concept, and had come up with a concept similar to Mark III in that it used its own private frequency for interrogations, 470&nbsp;MHz. Unlike the British designs, the response signal was on a separate frequency, 493.5&nbsp;MHz, and thus required its own complete transmitter. This avoided one IFF triggering another, but at the code of requiring a complete separate transmitter system. When the US and British formed the joint Combined Research Group at the NRL, this system was given the name Mark IV.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nA complication was that the response frequency was close enough to the 600&nbsp;MHz frequency of the German [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]]s that there was concern that those radar's pulses might trigger the transponder, causing a new blip to appear on the W\u00fcrzburg's [radar display]] and thus immediately reveal their operational frequency.{{sfn|Burns|1988|p=446}} With British systems already in widespread use, the decision was made to adopt Mark II and Mark III for US aircraft.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nIn 1942, the Combined Research Group began development of a new system based on the basic Mark IV pattern but with a further increase in operational frequency to 1.03&nbsp;GHz for the interrogation and 1.09&nbsp;GHz for the responses. This Mark V was to be the basis for IFF worldwide in the post-war era, and so was also known as the United Nations Beacon, or UNB.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} UNB adaptors for existing Mark III sets were produced and saw service with the US forces, but were not adopted elsewhere. The UK withdrew from the program in October 1945,{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}, believing another war was at least ten years off. The US only used UNB for a brief time because a new experimental concept, known as Mark X, was rapidly maturing.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\n===Mark X===\nThe main difference between Mark X and earlier IFF systems was the use of two pulses in the interrogation rather than one. A single pulse had been used in the past because the original interrogation signal was the radar beam sweeping past the aircraft, and these were single pulses of energy. With the IFF systems now working on completely different frequencies this was no longer required, and for the Mark X a system using two pulses was adopted.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nThere were two advantages to this system. The first was that an enemy interrogator would have to match both the frequency and timing of the pulses to trigger a response. This offered a small amount of additional security. Much more important, however, was that by varying the timing of the pulses, different replies could be triggered in the airborne transponder. The original design had three such \"modes\", Mode 1 was triggered by the interrogator by sending the two pulses 3&nbsp;\u00b5s apart (\u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b5s), Mode 2 was 5&nbsp;\u00b5s and Mode 3 was 8&nbsp;\u00b5s.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe response to these interrogations remained simple; a successful interrogation on Mode 1 or 3 caused a single pulse to be sent in reply, very shortly after the interrogation was received. Since this arrived back at the radar station after the return of the original radar pulse, this signal caused a second blip to appear on the radar screen at a slightly further distance. Mode 2 was similar, but returned two pulses from aircraft and a single delayed pulse from ships.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nThe aircraft transponder had a switch that set which Mode it was listening for, and would only respond to enquiries for that mode. In practice, the modes were used to identify individual aircraft. In UK use, for instance, most aircraft would set their transponder to Mode 1, which would provide basic IFF indication on their \"blip\" on the radar display. The flight leader would instead select Mode 3, thereby allowing the ground operator to sort out the entire formation from the individual aircraft within. Finally, Mode 2 was selected on demand to allow the operator to identify a specific aircraft.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to the basic Modes, the system also included an emergency response feature which was selected by the aircraft. When turned on, the aircraft always returned four pulses in reply to an interrogation, no matter what mode the ground station selected.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nAlthough they had withdrawn from the UNB, the UK kept in touch with their US counterparts, and officially adopted Mark X in October 1949, followed by the Canadians the next year. RAF representatives were invited to attend the testing in late 1951, by which point they had already contracted [[Ferranti]] to develop equipment that worked on both Mark III and Mark X.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}} Due to delays on both sides of the Atlantic, it was not until the early 1960s that Mark X support was truly universal.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=197}}\n\n===SIF===\nAllied systems had started as transponders which simply reflected the original radar pulse and were unable to encode any sort of customized response message. The US had been studying encoding more data into the return signal during the war, but ultimately felt getting a new system into service as quickly as possible was more important than improving its capabilities, so the original Mark X differed only in simple ways from Mark III.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nWhile development of the basic Mark X was still ongoing, development also began on the new Selective Identification Feature, or SIF. This system was initially implemented as a separate box that plugged into the Mark X and modified its return signals. Instead of two pulses, the SIF unit returned a \"pulse train\" that contained multiple pulses between start and stop \"framing\" pulses. Each pulse was 0.45&nbsp;\u00b5s in duration and 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s apart, and the train as a whole was 20.3&nbsp;microseconds long. Each group of three pulses is used to encode an [[octal]] digit, 0 to 7. In Mode 1 and 3, two sets of three pulses are used,{{sfn|Who|1993|p=58}} while Mode 2 used all four sets of pulses in the train.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=29}}\n\nTo help identify individual aircraft, ground operators would tell the aircraft to set their IFF to a particular Mode, and then select a two-digit code on the SIF box. In Mode 3, all 64 responses (00 to 77) were possible, but in Mode 1, the second digit was only 0 to 3, for a total of 32 codes.{{efn|Gough states there are 30 codes,{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}} but that is likely accounting for reserved codes like 77.}} Emergency mode remained, but only worked when interrogated by Mode 1 from the ground station. To indicate an emergency on Mode 3, the user instead dialled in code 77. To ensure the emergency code would be picked up by most interrogators, the operator would set the IFF to emergency and dial 77, thus responding with the same set of pulses on both Mode 1 and 3.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=29, 31}}\n\nThe longer response in Mode 2 was used solely by military users,{{efn|The mode may have been used solely by [[Air Defense Command]] in the US,{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}} but it is not clear.}} allowing them to identify individual aircraft. The four digits provided a total of 4096 possible codes, although 7700 was used for emergency, producing the same emergency response as above.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}}\n\n===ATCRBS===\n{{main|air traffic control radar beacon system}}\nIn 1953, the Mark X frequencies and SIF coding systems were released for civilian use worldwide.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}} In 1956, ICAO selected Mark X as the basis for worldwide civil aviation.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}} Selecting the existing system had the advantages of allowing the use of well-tested equipment as well as allowing existing military transponders to work within the larger civilian network.\n\nAlthough there was some use of Mark X in this role, especially in Europe, it was not widespread. In the US, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] was working on a system using [[3D radar]] and a computerized flight information system that they believed would revolutionize the industry. Development was still far from completed when the 16 December [[1960 New York mid-air collision]] occurred, in which a [[United Airlines]] [[DC-8]] overshot its assigned [[holding pattern]] and collided with a [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Super Constellation]]. Although the accident was ultimately the fault of the DC-8 crew, among the contributing factors was that the air traffic controller]]s were unable to positively identify the aircraft.\n\nIn the aftermath of the accident, the FAA came under considerable criticism from both the government and the civilian airlines. On 8 March 1961, [[President Kennedy]] launched Project Beacon to address these concerns. The Research and Development Bureau of the FAA continued to press for the development of their new systems, but the air traffic controllers told the FAA to abandon their 3D radar and instead pressed for modifications to the existing systems and transponders. The final report agreed with the controllers, instead of new systems, the transponders would be upgraded to provide this information.{{sfn|MIT|2000|p=Project Beacon}} These would be known as the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, or ATCRBS.{{sfn|FAA}}\n\nATCRBS introduced several civilian Modes, A through D. Mode A remained identical to the original Mode 3, with the exception that civilian aircraft would be provided with dials to allow all four digits to be used instead of just the first two.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=59}}{{sfn|FAA} Additionally, the new Mode C returned the aircraft's altitude, thereby eliminating the need for a separate [[height finder]] radar or 3D radar. Now a single sweep of the radar would locate the aircraft by its direct reflection, identify it by its Mode A response, and return its altitude through Mode C, showing all of this information continuously.{{sfn|FAA}\n\n[[File:Transponder 2.jpg|thumb|A light aircraft transponder, with dials to set all four digits of the Mode 3/A response.]]\n\nThe system is otherwise similar to SIF, using the same pulse train response format and octal encoding. In Mode A, similar to the original Mode 3, the only difference is that all four digits are sent,{{sfn|NRTC|p=8.2}} in the same fashion as military Mode 2. Using such a code means it would not be seen in military ground stations supporting only the older Mode 3, and for this reason, Mode A codes generally end with \"00\". For instance, the standard code to identify an aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] in North America is 1200, while emergency is, as with the military codes, 7700.{{sfn|Codes}}\n\nMilitary radars need to determine both the location and altitude of an enemy aircraft. A variety of methods were used to do this, often using several additional full-power [[height finding radar]]s dedicated for this purpose, or using [[3D radar]]s of some complexity. This was not appropriate for civilian use, but determining altitude was still valuable for proper [[air traffic control]] spacing. To fill this need, ATCRVS added Mode C, which uses the same four-digit format of the military Mode 2, but uses the digits to encode the altitude instead of an identifier. By alternating their queries between Mode A and C, and storing the values between receptions, a radar site can use the radar's own reflection to locate the aircraft in space, the Mode A response to identify it, and the Mode C to determine the altitude.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=59}}\n\nIn contrast to military users, civilian users may be asked to produce a complete four-digit code for Mode A responses. For uncontrolled aircraft, codes generally use only the first two digits so that they could also be read on older military ground equipment. For instance, the standard code to identify an aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] in North America is 1200, while emergency is, as with the military codes, 7700.{{sfn|Codes}} Mode B and D remain unused.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}}\n\n===Mark XII===\n{{main|IFF Mark XII}}\nIn the military, Mark X had the significant drawback that it continued to respond to any interrogator, allowing it to be used by enemy forces to triangulate aircraft. This was used by [[North Vietnam]] to track US aircraft movements. When this was noticed, pilots were told to turn off their IFF while over enemy territory,{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}} which led to restrictions on traffic control over enemy airspace.\n\nAs early as 1960, some development work began in the US on an encoding system that would work within the existing IFF network. This became [[IFF Mark XII]], which added cryptographic keys to the interrogation and response codes. Now an airborne transponder could check to see if the interrogation pulse was from a valid friendly source, and ignore anyone that did not present the proper code. Additionally, response formats were modified to allow more information to be returned. Mark XII began to be introduced by the US in the early 1970s, and gradually replaced Mark X. Outside the US, where ongoing air wars against a sophisticated enemy were not ongoing, Mark XII was not nearly as rapid or widespread.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}}\n\nAnother problem with Mark X, and its replacement Mark XII, is that it can be jammed by broadcasting on the known response frequencies. Work on a [[spread spectrum]] [[IFF Mark XV]] started in the US, but was cancelled in 1990 due to rising costs of the estimated 17,000 required units.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}}\n\n===Mode S===\n{{main|IFF Mode S}}\nAs traffic levels further increased in very busy airspaces, even proper interrogations could trigger so many responses that there was no way to tell which response was from which aircraft. This led to the introduction of [[IFF Mode S]]. In Mode S, every aircraft has its own unique 24-bit code that it responds with when queried with the correct interrogation signal. This allows the ground station to periodically send out a signal similar to Mode 3/A, but receive unique codes for every aircraft. From then on, the interrogator can send out position and altitude calls with specific codes, thereby having only the selected aircraft respond. Mode S also adds a series of long response formats that allow text messages and other information to be sent.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}}\n\n==Description==\n===Interrogation format===\nThe interrogation signal, sometimes known as the uplink format, consists of two 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5s long pulses on 1030&nbsp;MHz. The time between the pulses defines which mode is being queried. Mode 1 had two pulses 3&nbsp;\u00b5s apart (\u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b5s), Mode 2 was 5&nbsp;\u00b5s and Mode 3 was 8&nbsp;\u00b5s. The civil B, C and D were 17, 21 and 25&nbsp;\u00b5s apart. Mode S adds a P4 pulse after P1 and P3.{{sfn|Bodart|2019|p=3}}\n\nGround-based interrogators normally cycle through the different modes in order to collect complete information, this is known as the interlace pattern. For civilian sites, the pattern is normally A,C,A,C... For military users the pattern is typically 1,3/A,C,2,3/A,C... but some use 1,2,3/A,C,1,2,...{{sfn|Bodart|2019|p=4}}\n\n===Response format===\nIn the original pre-SIF system, the response to a properly received interrogation pulse is normally either one pulse in Mode 1 and 2, or two pulses in Mode 2. Turning on Emergency Mode produced four pulses in all modes.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\n[[File:Mode A & C reply.jpg|thumb|Mode A and C reply format.]]\n\nFor SIF-equipped systems, the response to a properly received interrogation pulse is a chain of 0.45&nbsp;\u00b5s (\u00b10.1&nbsp;\u00b5s) long pulses 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s apart framed by start and stop pulses. The pulses are labeled F1 and F2 for start and stop, and A1, B1, C1, A2, B2... for the response pulses. The responses are interleaved together, C1, A1, C2,...A4 followed by B1, D1... for a total of 12 possible pulses in four octal digits, A, B, C and D. A single extra \"X\" pulse in the center is left unused, so the total packet with framing is 20.2&nbsp;\u00b5s long.{{sfn|Wolff|p=The Reply Message}}\n\nThe pulses were timed out originally through the use of [[Analog delay line|delay line]]s. The initial specification had been for 3&nbsp;\u00b5s between pulses in a given digit, or 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5s between the interleaved pulses of A/C or B/D. When the first sample delay lines arrived they were defective and delayed only 2.9&nbsp;\u00b5s, resulting in the 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s timing between pulses.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=57}}\n\nMilitary Mode 1 transmits two digits, A and B, leaving the rest of the possible pulses empty. Only a subset of possible combinations are possible, with the complete 0 to 7 for the first digit but only 0 to 3 for the second, allowing 32 codes between 00 and 73. This is sometimes known as the \"mission signal\" and set by the air controllers prior to flight. In Mode 2 and 3, all 4096 possible 4-digit codes from 0000 to 7777 are allowed.{{sfn|NRTC|p=8.2}}\n\nFor Mode 3/A, the value of each of the digits, 0 to 7, is set through front-panel switches. For civilian use this is a code provided by the ATC controllers. Most [[general aviation]] aircraft in North America are told to \"squawk 1200\", meaning that they should set their transponder to 1200, whereas in the rest of the world, 7000 is used for this same purpose. Three special-purpose codes are also used, 7500 means the aircraft is being hijacked, 7600 means their voice radio set is not working, and 7700 is a general emergency.{{sfn|Codes}}\n\nFor mode C, the altitude is encoded using [[Gillham code]], using 11 bits. The lowest possible code is 000000000001, representing an altitude of -1200 feet. Every 100 feet of additional altitude above -1200 adds 1 to the total, so, for instance, 000000110100 is 1200 feet.\n\nSIF also adds a single additional optional pulse, Special Purpose Identification or SPI, which is sent 4.35&nbsp;\u00b5s after the F2. SPI is triggered manually by the transponder operator to identify a single aircraft by pressing a button. The SPI continues to be broadcast for 18&nbsp;seconds. Under ICAO rules, SPI should only be added to Mode 3/A.{{sfn|Wolff|p=The Reply Message}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine\n |first=Benjamin |last=Bibb\n |title=The Great Murgatroyd Frunch (IFF) SIF Scandal\n |magazine=Approach\n |volume=8 |issue=8\n |date=February 1963\n |publisher=Naval Safety Center\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=5ICDx-RtPIwC&pg=PP24\n |pages=24-31\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |last=Bodart\n |title=Radar Programming - MIP\n |date=26-28 February 2019\n |publisher=Eurocontrol\n |url=https://www.icao.int/MID/Documents/2019/MICA/MICA-MID%20-%20WP%2012%20-%20Radar%20programming%20-%20MIP.pdf\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=Jack |last=Gough\n |title=Watching the Skies: a history of ground radar for the air defence of the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force from 1946 to 1975\n |publisher=HMSO\n |isbn=978-0-11-772723-6\n |date=1993\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHcfAQAAIAAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=Who Goes There: Friend or Foe?\n |date=June 1993\n |publisher=U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment\n |url=https://ota.fas.org/reports/9351.pdf\n |ref=CITEREFWho1993\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=AP1093D: Introductory Survey of Radar Part II\n |publisher=Air Ministry\n |date=October 1947\n |ref=CITEREFAP1093D1947\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=Air Traffic Control Operator\n |publisher=Department of the Air Force\n |date=1959\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IVJTsUyg-bUC&pg=SA5-PA17\n |ref=CITEREFOperator1959\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |author=US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration \n |title=JO 7110.66F, National Beacon Code Allocation Plan\n |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1035828\n |publisher=FAA\n |access-date=2019-12-06\n |ref=CITEREFCodes\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |first=Christian |last=Wolff\n |title=Radar Tutorial\n |url=https://www.radartutorial.eu/13.ssr/sr07.en.html\n |website=Radar Tutorial\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Nonresident Training Courses, Electronics Technician, Volume 8\n |chapter=Identification Equipment\n |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/navy/nrtc/14308_ch8.pdf\n |ref=CITEREFNRTC\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |title=Project Beacon\n |url=https://lessonslearned.faa.gov/ll_main.cfm?TabID=4&LLID=58&LLTypeID=10\n |website=FAA\n |ref=CITEREFFAA\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/mode-s/index.html\n |title=The Story of Mode S: An Air Traffic Control Data-Link Technology\n |date=Fall 2000\n |website=MIT\n |ref=CITEREFMIT2000\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Radar Development to 1945\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MAdUAAAAMAAJ\n |editor-first=Russell |editor-last=Burns\n |publisher=Peregrinus\n |date=1988\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Instruments of Darkness: The History of Electronic Warfare, 1939-1945\n |first=Alfred |last=Price\n |date=2005\n |publisher=Greenhill\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kHgbAAAACAAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n[[Category:Identification friend or foe]]\n", "text_old": "'''IFF Mark X''' was the [[NATO]] standard military [[identification friend or foe]] [[transponder]] system from the early 1950s until it was slowly replaced by the [[IFF Mark XII]] in the 1970s. It was also adopted by [[ICAO]], with some modifications, as the civilian [[air traffic control]] (ATC) [[secondary radar]] (SSR) transponder. The X in the name does not mean \"tenth\", but \"eXperimental\".{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} Later IFF models acted as if it was the tenth in the series and used subsequent numbers.\n\nFor most of [[World War II]] the standard IFF system used by the allied air forces was the [[IFF Mark III]]. Mark III responded on the same frequency as the trigger signal, returning a selected pulse pattern. Originally, the Mark X was simply a version of Mark III operating at a higher frequency, which has several practical advantages. Three return patterns, or Modes, were available. As it was being introduced, the new '''Selective Identification Feature''', or '''SIF''', allowed the response signal to be modified with bit encoding, providing the ability for each aircraft to produce a unique response using [[octal]] digits. This was initially handled through a separate box that connected to the original Mark X. For a brief time in 1957 this was known as '''IFF Mark XI''' before becoming '''IFF Mark X (SIF)'''.\n\nAs the [[civil aviation]] market grew in the 1950s, Mark X was selected as the standard transponder system as the '''Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System''', or '''ATCRBS'''. For this role, a new series of four Modes was introduced, A through D. A is essentially identical to Mode 3, and these are now referred to as Mode 3/A. Mode C responds with a four-digit code encoding the [[pressure altitude]] in {{convert|100|foot}} increments. Combining information from a [[radar]] with Mode A and C responses, the ATC system can build a complete picture of the airspace without the need for [[height finder]]s or [[3D radar]]s. Using Mark X for the civilian role also allowed existing military users to be routed within the civilian network, as well as allowing civilian aircraft to use an existing and well-tested transponder design.\n\nMark X retained a key problem that was present in all IFF systems to date; the aircraft transponder would respond to any interrogation signal on the proper frequency with no way to tell if it was a friendly transmitter. This allows an enemy force to query the transponders and use [[triangulation]] to determine their location, or simply count the responses to look for increased activity. Military users had long desired a system that encoded both the interrogation and response, allowing the transponders to ignore signals from interrogators that did not present the right code. This led to the development of [[IFF Mark XII]] and its associated Mode 4 which began to be deployed in 1970.\n\n==History==\n===Mark III===\n{{main|IFF Mark III}}\n\nThe first IFF system to see widespread multinational use was the British [[IFF Mark III]], which appeared in early 1942 with the [[Royal Air Force]] and then used for the rest of the war by the US and Canada as well.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} This was a simple system that listened for broadcasts on a narrow band of frequencies, amplified the incoming signal using a [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative receiver]], and rebroadcast the result.{{sfn|AP1093D|1947|loc=117}} The regenerative design was extremely simple, often consisting of a single [[vacuum tube]]. The ground station used an \"interrogator\" to send out pulses in synchronicity with a [[radar]] unit, and mixed the received signal into the one from the radar to produce a unified display. On most [[radar display]]s, the IFF signal would lengthen the \"blip\" or cause additional blips to appear.{{sfn|AP1093D|1947|loc=Chapter 6}}\n\nMark III had the serious limitation that it would respond to signals from any broadcast in the 176&nbsp;MHz range. It was long feared that the Germans would send out their own interrogation pulses and then use a [[radio direction finder]] to locate the aircraft. The British did this to German [[night fighter]]s using a system known as [[Perfectos]],{{sfn|Price|2005|p=229}} forcing the Germans to turn off their IFFs and causing many [[friendly fire]] incidents. It seemed logical that the Germans would return the favour, but this was rarely the case; while ground-based radio reconnaissance units were known to track British aircraft by their IFF on occasion,{{sfn|Price|2005|p=178}} their success was greatly mitigated by turning the IFF transponder off while over enemy airspace.{{sfn|Price|2005|p=222}} The Germans could not do the same, as they were almost always flying over their own airspace.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a215411.pdf |title=Electronic Combat Over the Third Reich |first=Stephen |last=Fraley |date=11 December 1989 |publisher=Air Command and Staff College}}</ref>\n\nA more practical concern was that the IFF signals were in the middle of existing [[VHF]] radar bands; moving to a new frequency would help reduce potential interference. Moving to a higher frequency would have the added advantage of allowing the use of smaller antennas. Another issue with Mark III was that the transponder responded on the same frequency as the interrogation pulse, so other IFFs might hear the response signal and trigger their own, resulting in cascade of replies. This was particularly problematic near airports, where aircraft clustered and could hear each other's signals. Using separate send and receive frequencies would solve this, but the regenerative design worked by [[feedback|feeding back]] a received signal.<ref name=\"Poole\">{{cite book |last=Poole |first=Ian |title=Basic Radio: Principles and Technology |publisher=Newnes |date=1998 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaUGlb_Gd18C&pg=PA100 |isbn=0080938469}}</ref>\n\n===US efforts, Mark IV===\nThe [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) had also been considering the IFF concept, and had come up with a concept similar to Mark III in that it used its own private frequency for interrogations, 470&nbsp;MHz. Unlike the British designs, the response signal was on a separate frequency, 493.5&nbsp;MHz, and thus required its own complete transmitter. This avoided one IFF triggering another, but at the code of requiring a complete separate transmitter system. When the US and British formed the joint Combined Research Group at the NRL, this system was given the name Mark IV.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nA complication was that the response frequency was close enough to the 600&nbsp;MHz frequency of the German [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]]s that there was concern that those radar's pulses might trigger the transponder, causing a new blip to appear on the W\u00fcrzburg's [radar display]] and thus immediately reveal their operational frequency.{{sfn|Burns|1988|p=446}} With British systems already in widespread use, the decision was made to adopt Mark II and Mark III for US aircraft.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nIn 1942, the Combined Research Group began development of a new system based on the basic Mark IV pattern but with a further increase in operational frequency to 1.03&nbsp;GHz for the interrogation and 1.09&nbsp;GHz for the responses. This Mark V was to be the basis for IFF worldwide in the post-war era, and so was also known as the United Nations Beacon, or UNB.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}} UNB adaptors for existing Mark III sets were produced and saw service with the US forces, but were not adopted elsewhere. The UK withdrew from the program in October 1945,{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}, believing another war was at least ten years off. The US only used UNB for a brief time because a new experimental concept, known as Mark X, was rapidly maturing.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\n===Mark X===\nThe main difference between Mark X and earlier IFF systems was the use of two pulses in the interrogation rather than one. A single pulse had been used in the past because the original interrogation signal was the radar beam sweeping past the aircraft, and these were single pulses of energy. With the IFF systems now working on completely different frequencies this was no longer required, and for the Mark X a system using two pulses was adopted.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=55}}\n\nThere were two advantages to this system. The first was that an enemy interrogator would have to match both the frequency and timing of the pulses to trigger a response. This offered a small amount of additional security. Much more important, however, was that by varying the timing of the pulses, different replies could be triggered in the airborne transponder. The original design had three such \"modes\", Mode 1 was triggered by the interrogator by sending the two pulses 3&nbsp;\u00b5s apart (\u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b5s), Mode 2 was 5&nbsp;\u00b5s and Mode 3 was 8&nbsp;\u00b5s.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe response to these interrogations remained simple; a successful interrogation on Mode 1 or 3 caused a single pulse to be sent in reply, very shortly after the interrogation was received. Since this arrived back at the radar station after the return of the original radar pulse, this signal caused a second blip to appear on the radar screen at a slightly further distance. Mode 2 was similar, but returned two pulses from aircraft and a single delayed pulse from ships.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nThe aircraft transponder had a switch that set which Mode it was listening for, and would only respond to enquiries for that mode. In practice, the modes were used to identify individual aircraft. In UK use, for instance, most aircraft would set their transponder to Mode 1, which would provide basic IFF indication on their \"blip\" on the radar display. The flight leader would instead select Mode 3, thereby allowing the ground operator to sort out the entire formation from the individual aircraft within. Finally, Mode 2 was selected on demand to allow the operator to identify a specific aircraft.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to the basic Modes, the system also included an emergency response feature which was selected by the aircraft. When turned on, the aircraft always returned four pulses in reply to an interrogation, no matter what mode the ground station selected.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nAlthough they had withdrawn from the UNB, the UK kept in touch with their US counterparts, and officially adopted Mark X in October 1949, followed by the Canadians the next year. RAF representatives were invited to attend the testing in late 1951, by which point they had already contracted [[Ferranti]] to develop equipment that worked on both Mark III and Mark X.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}} Due to delays on both sides of the Atlantic, it was not until the early 1960s that Mark X support was truly universal.{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=197}}\n\n===SIF===\nAllied systems had started as transponders which simply reflected the original radar pulse and were unable to encode any sort of customized response message. The US had been studying encoding more data into the return signal during the war, but ultimately felt getting a new system into service as quickly as possible was more important than improving its capabilities, so the original Mark X differed only in simple ways from Mark III.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\nWhile development of the basic Mark X was still ongoing, development also began on the new Selective Identification Feature, or SIF. This system was initially implemented as a separate box that plugged into the Mark X and modified its return signals. Instead of two pulses, the SIF unit returned a \"pulse train\" that contained multiple pulses between start and stop \"framing\" pulses. Each pulse was 0.45&nbsp;\u00b5s in duration and 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s apart, and the train as a whole was 20.3&nbsp;microseconds long. Each group of three pulses is used to encode an [[octal]] digit, 0 to 7. In Mode 1 and 3, two sets of three pulses are used,{{sfn|Who|1993|p=58}} while Mode 2 used all four sets of pulses in the train.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=29}}\n\nTo help identify individual aircraft, ground operators would tell the aircraft to set their IFF to a particular Mode, and then select a two-digit code on the SIF box. In Mode 3, all 64 responses (00 to 77) were possible, but in Mode 1, the second digit was only 0 to 3, for a total of 32 codes.{{efn|Gough states there are 30 codes,{{sfn|Gough|1993|p=131}} but that is likely accounting for reserved codes like 77.}} Emergency mode remained, but only worked when interrogated by Mode 1 from the ground station. To indicate an emergency on Mode 3, the user instead dialled in code 77. To ensure the emergency code would be picked up by most interrogators, the operator would set the IFF to emergency and dial 77, thus responding with the same set of pulses on both Mode 1 and 3.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=29, 31}}\n\nThe longer response in Mode 2 was used solely by military users,{{efn|The mode may have been used solely by [[Air Defense Command]] in the US,{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}} but it is not clear.}} allowing them to identify individual aircraft. The four digits provided a total of 4096 possible codes, although 7700 was used for emergency, producing the same emergency response as above.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}}\n\n===ATCRBS===\n{{main|air traffic control radar beacon system}}\nIn 1953, the Mark X frequencies and SIF coding systems were released for civilian use worldwide.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}} In 1956, ICAO selected Mark X as the basis for worldwide civil aviation.{{sfn|Bibb|1963|p=30}} Selecting the existing system had the advantages of allowing the use of well-tested equipment as well as allowing existing military transponders to work within the larger civilian network.\n\nAlthough there was some use of Mark X in this role, especially in Europe, it was not widespread. In the US, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] was working on a system using [[3D radar]] and a computerized flight information system that they believed would revolutionize the industry. Development was still far from completed when the 16 December [[1960 New York mid-air collision]] occurred, in which a [[United Airlines]] [[DC-8]] overshot its assigned [[holding pattern]] and collided with a [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Super Constellation]]. Although the accident was ultimately the fault of the DC-8 crew, among the contributing factors was that the air traffic controller]]s were unable to positively identify the aircraft.\n\nIn the aftermath of the accident, the FAA came under considerable criticism from both the government and the civilian airlines. On 8 March 1961, [[President Kennedy]] launched Project Beacon to address these concerns. The Research and Development Bureau of the FAA continued to press for the development of their new systems, but the air traffic controllers told the FAA to abandon their 3D radar and instead pressed for modifications to the existing systems and transponders. The final report agreed with the controllers, instead of new systems, the transponders would be upgraded to provide this information.{{sfn|MIT|2000|p=Project Beacon}} These would be known as the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, or ATCRBS.{{sfn|FAA}}\n\nATCRBS introduced several civilian Modes, A through D. Mode A remained identical to the original Mode 3, with the exception that civilian aircraft would be provided with dials to allow all four digits to be used instead of just the first two.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=59}}{{sfn|FAA} Additionally, the new Mode C returned the aircraft's altitude, thereby eliminating the need for a separate [[height finder]] radar or 3D radar. Now a single sweep of the radar would locate the aircraft by its direct reflection, identify it by its Mode A response, and return its altitude through Mode C, showing all of this information continuously.{{sfn|FAA}\n\n[[File:Transponder 2.jpg|thumb|A light aircraft transponder, with dials to set all four digits of the Mode 3/A response.]]\n\nThe system is otherwise similar to SIF, using the same pulse train response format and octal encoding. In Mode A, similar to the original Mode 3, the only difference is that all four digits are sent,{{sfn|NRTC|p=8.2}} in the same fashion as military Mode 2. Using such a code means it would not be seen in military ground stations supporting only the older Mode 3, and for this reason, Mode A codes generally end with \"00\". For instance, the standard code to identify an aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] in North America is 1200, while emergency is, as with the military codes, 7700.{{sfn|Codes}}\n\nMilitary radars need to determine both the location and altitude of an enemy aircraft. A variety of methods were used to do this, often using several additional full-power [[height finding radar]]s dedicated for this purpose, or using [[3D radar]]s of some complexity. This was not appropriate for civilian use, but determining altitude was still valuable for proper [[air traffic control]] spacing. To fill this need, ATCRVS added Mode C, which uses the same four-digit format of the military Mode 2, but uses the digits to encode the altitude instead of an identifier. By alternating their queries between Mode A and C, and storing the values between receptions, a radar site can use the radar's own reflection to locate the aircraft in space, the Mode A response to identify it, and the Mode C to determine the altitude.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=59}}\n\nIn contrast to military users, civilian users may be asked to produce a complete four-digit code for Mode A responses. For uncontrolled aircraft, codes generally use only the first two digits so that they could also be read on older military ground equipment. For instance, the standard code to identify an aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] in North America is 1200, while emergency is, as with the military codes, 7700.{{sfn|Codes}} Mode B and D remain unused.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}}\n\n===Mark XII===\n{{main|IFF Mark XII}}\nIn the military, Mark X had the significant drawback that it continued to respond to any interrogator, allowing it to be used by enemy forces to triangulate aircraft. This was used by [[North Vietnam]] to track US aircraft movements. When this was noticed, pilots were told to turn off their IFF while over enemy territory,{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}} which led to restrictions on traffic control over enemy airspace.\n\nAs early as 1960, some development work began in the US on an encoding system that would work within the existing IFF network. This became [[IFF Mark XII]], which added cryptographic keys to the interrogation and response codes. Now an airborne transponder could check to see if the interrogation pulse was from a valid friendly source, and ignore anyone that did not present the proper code. Additionally, response formats were modified to allow more information to be returned. Mark XII began to be introduced by the US in the early 1970s, and gradually replaced Mark X. Outside the US, where ongoing air wars against a sophisticated enemy were not ongoing, Mark XII was not nearly as rapid or widespread.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}}\n\nAnother problem with Mark X, and its replacement Mark XII, is that it can be jammed by broadcasting on the known response frequencies. Work on a [[spread spectrum]] [[IFF Mark XV]] started in the US, but was cancelled in 1990 due to rising costs of the estimated 17,000 required units.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=61}}\n\n===Mode S===\n{{main|IFF Mode S}}\nAs traffic levels further increased in very busy airspaces, even proper interrogations could trigger so many responses that there was no way to tell which response was from which aircraft. This led to the introduction of [[IFF Mode S]]. In Mode S, every aircraft has its own unique 24-bit code that it responds with when queried with the correct interrogation signal. This allows the ground station to periodically send out a signal similar to Mode 3/A, but receive unique codes for every aircraft. From then on, the interrogator can send out position and altitude calls with specific codes, thereby having only the selected aircraft respond. Mode S also adds a series of long response formats that allow text messages and other information to be sent.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=63}}\n\n==Description==\n===Interrogation format===\nThe interrogation signal, sometimes known as the uplink format, consists of two 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5s long pulses on 1030&nbsp;MHz. The time between the pulses defines which mode is being queried. Mode 1 had two pulses 3&nbsp;\u00b5s apart (\u00b10.2&nbsp;\u00b5s), Mode 2 was 5&nbsp;\u00b5s and Mode 3 was 8&nbsp;\u00b5s. The civil B, C and D were 17, 21 and 25&nbsp;\u00b5s apart. Mode S adds a P4 pulse after P1 and P3.{{sfn|Bodart|2019|p=3}}\n\nGround-based interrogators normally cycle through the different modes in order to collect complete information, this is known as the interlace pattern. For civilian sites, the pattern is normally A,C,A,C... For military users the pattern is typically 1,3/A,C,2,3/A,C... but some use 1,2,3/A,C,1,2,...{{sfn|Bodart|2019|p=4}}\n\n===Response format===\nIn the original pre-SIF system, the response to a properly received interrogation pulse is normally either one pulse in Mode 1 and 2, or two pulses in Mode 2. Turning on Emergency Mode produced four pulses in all modes.{{sfn|Operator|1959|p=5.18}}\n\n[[File:Mode A & C reply.jpg|thumb|Mode A and C reply format.]]\n\nFor SIF-equipped systems, the response to a properly received interrogation pulse is a chain of 0.45&nbsp;\u00b5s (\u00b10.1&nbsp;\u00b5s) long pulses 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s apart framed by start and stop pulses. The pulses are labeled F1 and F2 for start and stop, and A1, B1, C1, A2, B2... for the response pulses. The responses are interleaved together, C1, A1, C2,...A4 followed by B1, D1... for a total of 12 possible pulses in four octal digits, A, B, C and D. A single extra \"X\" pulse in the center is left unused, so the total packet with framing is 20.2&nbsp;\u00b5s long.{{sfn|Wolff|p=The Reply Message}}\n\nThe pulses were timed out originally through the use of [[delay line]]s. The initial specification had been for 3&nbsp;\u00b5s between pulses in a given digit, or 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5s between the interleaved pulses of A/C or B/D. When the first sample delay lines arrived they were defective and delayed only 2.9&nbsp;\u00b5s, resulting in the 1.45&nbsp;\u00b5s timing between pulses.{{sfn|Who|1993|p=57}}\n\nMilitary Mode 1 transmits two digits, A and B, leaving the rest of the possible pulses empty. Only a subset of possible combinations are possible, with the complete 0 to 7 for the first digit but only 0 to 3 for the second, allowing 32 codes between 00 and 73. This is sometimes known as the \"mission signal\" and set by the air controllers prior to flight. In Mode 2 and 3, all 4096 possible 4-digit codes from 0000 to 7777 are allowed.{{sfn|NRTC|p=8.2}}\n\nFor Mode 3/A, the value of each of the digits, 0 to 7, is set through front-panel switches. For civilian use this is a code provided by the ATC controllers. Most [[general aviation]] aircraft in North America are told to \"squawk 1200\", meaning that they should set their transponder to 1200, whereas in the rest of the world, 7000 is used for this same purpose. Three special-purpose codes are also used, 7500 means the aircraft is being hijacked, 7600 means their voice radio set is not working, and 7700 is a general emergency.{{sfn|Codes}}\n\nFor mode C, the altitude is encoded using [[Gillham code]], using 11 bits. The lowest possible code is 000000000001, representing an altitude of -1200 feet. Every 100 feet of additional altitude above -1200 adds 1 to the total, so, for instance, 000000110100 is 1200 feet.\n\nSIF also adds a single additional optional pulse, Special Purpose Identification or SPI, which is sent 4.35&nbsp;\u00b5s after the F2. SPI is triggered manually by the transponder operator to identify a single aircraft by pressing a button. The SPI continues to be broadcast for 18&nbsp;seconds. Under ICAO rules, SPI should only be added to Mode 3/A.{{sfn|Wolff|p=The Reply Message}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine\n |first=Benjamin |last=Bibb\n |title=The Great Murgatroyd Frunch (IFF) SIF Scandal\n |magazine=Approach\n |volume=8 |issue=8\n |date=February 1963\n |publisher=Naval Safety Center\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=5ICDx-RtPIwC&pg=PP24\n |pages=24-31\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |last=Bodart\n |title=Radar Programming - MIP\n |date=26-28 February 2019\n |publisher=Eurocontrol\n |url=https://www.icao.int/MID/Documents/2019/MICA/MICA-MID%20-%20WP%2012%20-%20Radar%20programming%20-%20MIP.pdf\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=Jack |last=Gough\n |title=Watching the Skies: a history of ground radar for the air defence of the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force from 1946 to 1975\n |publisher=HMSO\n |isbn=978-0-11-772723-6\n |date=1993\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHcfAQAAIAAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=Who Goes There: Friend or Foe?\n |date=June 1993\n |publisher=U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment\n |url=https://ota.fas.org/reports/9351.pdf\n |ref=CITEREFWho1993\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=AP1093D: Introductory Survey of Radar Part II\n |publisher=Air Ministry\n |date=October 1947\n |ref=CITEREFAP1093D1947\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title=Air Traffic Control Operator\n |publisher=Department of the Air Force\n |date=1959\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IVJTsUyg-bUC&pg=SA5-PA17\n |ref=CITEREFOperator1959\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |author=US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration \n |title=JO 7110.66F, National Beacon Code Allocation Plan\n |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1035828\n |publisher=FAA\n |access-date=2019-12-06\n |ref=CITEREFCodes\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |first=Christian |last=Wolff\n |title=Radar Tutorial\n |url=https://www.radartutorial.eu/13.ssr/sr07.en.html\n |website=Radar Tutorial\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Nonresident Training Courses, Electronics Technician, Volume 8\n |chapter=Identification Equipment\n |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/navy/nrtc/14308_ch8.pdf\n |ref=CITEREFNRTC\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |title=Project Beacon\n |url=https://lessonslearned.faa.gov/ll_main.cfm?TabID=4&LLID=58&LLTypeID=10\n |website=FAA\n |ref=CITEREFFAA\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/mode-s/index.html\n |title=The Story of Mode S: An Air Traffic Control Data-Link Technology\n |date=Fall 2000\n |website=MIT\n |ref=CITEREFMIT2000\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Radar Development to 1945\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MAdUAAAAMAAJ\n |editor-first=Russell |editor-last=Burns\n |publisher=Peregrinus\n |date=1988\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Instruments of Darkness: The History of Electronic Warfare, 1939-1945\n |first=Alfred |last=Price\n |date=2005\n |publisher=Greenhill\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kHgbAAAACAAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n[[Category:Identification friend or foe]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:delay line\u2192Analog delay line", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFF_Mark_X"}

Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules]. [[USATF]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\nThe course should have {{convert|400|to|1200|m|yd|abbr=on}} of level terrain before the first turn, to reduce contact and congestion at the start. However, many courses at smaller competitions have their first turn after a much shorter distance.<ref name=NCAARules>[http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/TF12.pdf 2011/2012 NCAA Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country Rules]. [[NCAA]]. Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Distances===\nCourses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1750 and 2000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book.

English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the dark, as it began at 5 pm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burfoot|first=Amby|title=Common Ground|journal=Runners World|date=July 2006|volume=92}}</ref>{{MOS|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Olympic Games===\n{{main|Cross country running at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Ind cross country 1924 Summer Olympics.jpg|300px|thumb|Individual cross country race at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

[[England]] won the first 14 titles, and 43 of 59 until the IAAF took over the competition in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]]. [[France]] was the next most successful country in the early years, winning 12 championships between 1922 and 1956. [[Belgium]] is the only other country to win at the International Cross Country Championship, capturing titles in 1948, 1957, 1961 and 1963. The English also dominated the individual competition, with an Englishman winning the individual title 35 times, including three wins by [[Jack Holden (athlete)|Jack Holden]] (1933\u20131935).\n\nThe first international cross country championship for women was held in 1931, and thirteen more times through 1972. England won 12 of these early championships, losing only in 1968 and 1969 (to the United States). American [[Doris Brown]] won five consecutive individual titles between 1967 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]], the IAAF began hosting the renamed [[World Cross Country Championships]] each year. In [[1975 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1975]], the [[New Zealand]] men and United States women won, marking the first championships by non-European countries.

In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool (especially at the senior level) for university- or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].<ref>[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/ CIS Cross Country Championships]. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe organization of cross country running in the United Kingdom has continued to be mostly devolved to the four national associations: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sport is based around the clubs, which usually are mixed cross country and road running clubs. The [[English Cross Country Association]] is part of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]].\n\nCross country running takes place from roughly September until March. Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.

Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules].

However, many courses at smaller competitions have their first turn after a much shorter distance.<ref name=NCAARules>[http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/TF12.pdf 2011/2012 NCAA Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country Rules]. [[NCAA]]. Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Distances===\nCourses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1750 and 2000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book.

English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the dark, as it began at 5 pm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burfoot|first=Amby|title=Common Ground|journal=Runners World|date=July 2006|volume=92}}</ref>{{MOS|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Olympic Games===\n{{main|Cross country running at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Ind cross country 1924 Summer Olympics.jpg|300px|thumb|Individual cross country race at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

[[France]] was the next most successful country in the early years, winning 12 championships between 1922 and 1956. [[Belgium]] is the only other country to win at the International Cross Country Championship, capturing titles in 1948, 1957, 1961 and 1963. The English also dominated the individual competition, with an Englishman winning the individual title 35 times, including three wins by [[Jack Holden (athlete)|Jack Holden]] (1933\u20131935).\n\nThe first international cross country championship for women was held in 1931, and thirteen more times through 1972. England won 12 of these early championships, losing only in 1968 and 1969 (to the United States). American [[Doris Brown]] won five consecutive individual titles between 1967 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]], the IAAF began hosting the renamed [[World Cross Country Championships]] each year.

In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool (especially at the senior level) for university- or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].<ref>[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/ CIS Cross Country Championships]. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe organization of cross country running in the United Kingdom has continued to be mostly devolved to the four national associations: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sport is based around the clubs, which usually are mixed cross country and road running clubs. The [[English Cross Country Association]] is part of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]].\n\nCross country running takes place from roughly September until March. Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.
