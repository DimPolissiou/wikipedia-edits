{"title_page": "Chemically defined medium", "text_new": "A '''chemically defined medium''' is a [[growth medium]] suitable for the [[in vitro]] [[cell culture]] of [[human cells|human]] or [[animal cells]] in which all of the chemical components are known. Standard cell culture media commonly consist of a basal medium supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between serum-based media and chemically defined media. Serum-based media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, chemically defined media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a chemically defined medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either [[fetal bovine serum]], [[bovine serum]] or [[human serum]]. To achieve this, chemically defined media is commonly supplemented with recombinant versions of albumin and growth factors, usually derived from rice or ''E. coli'', or synthetic chemical such as the polymer [[polyvinyl alcohol]] which can reproduce some of the functions of BSA/HSA.\n\nThe constituents of a chemically defined media include: a basal media (such as DMEM, F12, or RPMI 1640, containing amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, buffers, antioxidants and energy sources), which is supplemented with recombinant albumin, chemically defined lipids, recombinant [[insulin]] and/or zinc, recombinant [[transferrin]] or iron, [[selenium]] and an antioxidant [[thiol]] such as [[2-mercaptoethanol]] or [[1-thioglycerol]]. Chemically defined media that are designed for the cultivation of cells in suspension additionally contain suitable [[Surfactant|surfactants]] such as [[Poloxamer|poloxamers]] in order to reduce shear stress caused by shaking and stirring.\n\n==The advantages of chemically defined media==\n\n* Avoidance of batch to batch variation of bovine serum or albumin, which causes inconsistency in growth-promoting properties. \n* Low protein content, which can hinder product purification. \n* Elimination of the risk of contaminants\u2014viruses, mycoplasma, prions from animal-derived products which may be transmitted to the end product used by humans, e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. \n* Elimination of factors that may interfere with hormones or growth factors when studying their interaction with cells. \n* Removal of concerns regarding the limited availability of fetal bovine serum, with periods of world shortages. \n* Reduced cost: fetal calf serum can account for up to 85% of the overall cost of the medium when calculated for large-scale cultures.  \n* There are increasing concerns about animal suffering inflicted during serum collection that add an ethical imperative to move away from the use of serum wherever possible.\n\nChemically defined media also allows researchers who are studying in the field of cell physiology (especially extracellular) and or molecule\u2013cell interactions to eliminate any variables that may arise due to the effects of unknown components in the medium. \n\n==Classes of media==\nAnimal culture media can be divided into six subsets based on the level of defined media (Jayme and Smith, 2000): From lowest definition to highest these are:\n\n* Serum-containing media (commonly 10-20% FBS)\n* Reduced-serum media (commonly 1-5% FBS)\n* Serum-free media (synonymous with Defined media) \n* Protein-free media (no protein but contains undefined peptides from plant hydrolysates)\n* Chemically-defined media (with only recombinant proteins and/or hormones)\n* Protein-free, chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents, but can contain synthetic peptides/hormones)\n* Peptide-free, protein-free chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents)\n\n==Misuse of the term chemically defined media==\nThe term chemically defined media is often misused in the literature to refer to serum albumin-containing media. The term 'defined media' can also be used to describe this type of media. Media formulations containing the media supplement B27 (supplied by [[Invitrogen]]) are often erroneously referred to as chemically defined media (e.g. Yao et al., 2006) despite this product containing bovine serum albumin (Chen et al., 2008) using the above definitions this type of media is referred to as serum-free media.

Standard cell culture media commonly consist of a basal medium supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between serum-free media and chemically defined media. Serum-free media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, chemically defined media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a chemically defined medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either [[fetal bovine serum]], [[bovine serum]] or [[human serum]].

Since then the method has been extended to other models in one dimension: the (anisotropic) Heisenberg chain (XXZ model), the Lieb-Liniger interacting [[Bose gas]], the [[Hubbard model]], the [[Kondo model]], the [[Anderson impurity model]], the Richardson model etc.\n\n==Discussion==\nIn the framework of many-body [[quantum mechanics]], models solvable by the Bethe ansatz can be contrasted with free fermion models. One can say that the dynamics of a free model is one-body reducible: the many-body wave function for [[fermions]] ([[bosons]]) is the anti-symmetrized (symmetrized) product of one-body wave functions. Models solvable by the Bethe ansatz are not free: the two-body sector has a non-trivial [[S-matrix|scattering matrix]], which in general depends on the momenta.\n\nOn the other hand, the dynamics of the models solvable by the Bethe ansatz is two-body reducible: the many-body scattering matrix is a product of two-body scattering matrices. Many-body collisions happen as a sequence of two-body collisions and the many-body wave function can be represented in a form which contains only elements from two-body wave functions. The many-body scattering matrix is equal to the product of pairwise scattering matrices.\n\nThe generic form the Bethe ansatz for a many-body wavefunction is\n\n<math>\n\\Psi_M(j_1, \\cdots, j_M) = \\prod_{M \\geq a > b \\geq 1} \\text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) \\sum_{P \\in P_M} (-1)^{[P]} e^{i \\sum_{a=1}^M k_{P_a} j_a + \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{M \\geq a > b \\geq 1} \\text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) \\phi(k_{P_a}, k_{P_b})}\n</math> \n\nin which <math>M</math> is the number of particles, <math>j_a, a=1, \\cdots M</math> their position, <math>P_M</math> is the set of all permutations of the integers <math>1, \\cdots, M</math>, <math>k_a</math> is the (quasi-)momentum of the <math>a</math>-th particle, <math>\\phi</math> is the scattering phase shift function and <math>sgn</math> is the sign function. This form is universal (at least for non-nested systems), with the momentum and scattering functions being model-dependent.\n\nThe [[Yang\u2013Baxter equation]] guarantees consistency of the construction. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is valid for models solvable by the Bethe ansatz, even for models of interacting [[bosons]].\n\nThe [[ground state]] is a [[Fermi surface|Fermi sphere]]. [[Periodic boundary conditions]] lead to the Bethe ansatz equations. In logarithmic form the Bethe ansatz equations can be generated by the [[Chen Nin Yang|Yang action]]. The square of the norm of Bethe wave function is equal to the determinant of the matrix of second derivatives of the Yang action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Korepin|first=Vladimir E.|author-link=Vladimir Korepin|date=1982|title=Calculation of norms of Bethe wave functions|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103921777|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|language=en|volume=86|issue=3|pages=391\u2013418|issn=0010-3616|via=|doi=10.1007/BF01212176}}</ref> The recently{{when|date=November 2015}} developed [[quantum inverse scattering method|algebraic Bethe ansatz]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kaZ0pKIHhxAC&dq=quantum+inverse+scattering+method&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and Correlation Functions|last=Korepin|first=V.

A desire to pursue music beyond these ventures led Byrne to audition for ''[[The Voice of Ireland]]''.<ref name=\"tubs podcast\">{{cite web|last=Tubridy|first=Ryan|title=Tubridy podcast- Interview with Bressie and winner, Pat Byrne|url=feed://www.rte.ie/radio1/podcast/podcast_tubridy.xml|date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nByrne has come a long way since winning the inaugural season of \u201cThe Voice of Ireland\u201d.  \u201cThe Voice\u201d was a learning experience, that included both highs and lows. Making an album in 3 months meant writing new songs with some talented people, but also, in some ways, compromising on the art Byrne wanted to create. After the initial roar, things went back to normal and Byrne continued gigging around Ireland, UK and Europe; however, with a new sense of confidence.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2012: ''The Voice of Ireland''===\nByrne entered ''The Voice of Ireland'' in 2011, singing [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[The River (Bruce Springsteen song)|The River]]\" at the blind auditions. All four coaches turned around but Byrne ultimately chose [[Niall Breslin|Niall \"Bressie\" Breslin]] as his coach.

In 2012, Byrne was crowned the winner of the [[The Voice of Ireland (series 1)|first series]] of ''[[The Voice of Ireland]]''. In late 2017, Byrne began his migration to Austin, Texas.

Making an album in 3 months meant writing new songs with some talented people, but also, in some ways, compromising on the art Byrne wanted to create. After the initial roar, things went back to normal and Byrne continued gigging around Ireland, UK and Europe; however, with a new sense of confidence.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2012: ''The Voice of Ireland''===\nByrne entered ''The Voice of Ireland'' in 2011, singing [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[The River (Bruce Springsteen song)|The River]]\" at the blind auditions.

Selznick]], which tells the story of a [[Mestiza]] (half-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) girl who goes to live with her white relatives, becoming involved in prejudice and forbidden love. The [[Technicolor]] film stars [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lionel Barrymore]].\n\n==Plot==\nPearl Chavez is orphaned after her father Scott Chavez kills her mother, having caught her with a lover. Before Scott Chavez is executed as a punishment for killing his wife, he arranges for his daughter Pearl to live with his second cousin and old sweetheart, Laura Belle.\n\nArriving by stagecoach, Pearl is met by Jesse McCanles, one of Laura Belle's two grown sons. He takes her to Spanish Bit, their enormous cattle ranch. The gentle and gracious Laura Belle is happy to welcome her to their home, but not so her husband, the Senator Jackson McCanles, who uses a wheelchair. He calls Pearl \"a half-breed\" and jealously despises Pearl's father.\n\nThe second son, Lewt, is a ladies' man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the \"Sinkiller\", a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain \"a good girl.\"\n\nWhen she submits to Lewt's aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford, against the Senator's personal interests. Jesse is in love with Pearl but he leaves for [[Austin]] to pursue a political career and becomes engaged to Helen Langford, Langford's daughter.\n\nOffended when Lewt reneges on a promise to marry her, Pearl takes up with Sam Pierce, a neighboring rancher who is smitten with her. She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him.  Lewt becomes a wanted man.\n\nOn the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room.  Afterward, however, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.\n\nLaura Belle's health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up.  Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.\n\nThe Senator's old friend, Lem Smoot tells him that Jesse's wound is not mortal and the old man softens up towards his son and reconciles. A livid Pearl is relieved that Jesse is going to survive. When Helen arrives, she invites Pearl to leave Spanish Bit forever and come live with them in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Pearl agrees, but she is tipped off by one of the Spanish Bit hands, Sid that Lewt intends to come after Jesse again. She arms herself and engages in a shootout with Lewt in the desert, where they die in each other's arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as Pearl Chavez\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Jesse McCanles\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Lewton \"Lewt\" McCanles\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Senator Jackson McCanles\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Scott Chavez\n* [[Lillian Gish]] as Laura Belle McCanles\n* [[Walter Huston]] as Jubal Crabbe, The Sinkiller\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Sam Pierce\n* [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] as Lem Smoot\n* [[Charles Dingle]] as Sheriff Hardy\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as The \"Lover\" of Mrs. Chavez\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Vashti\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Mr. Langford\n* [[Joan Tetzel]] as Helen Langford\n* [[Tilly Losch]] as Mrs. Chavez \n* Scott McKay as Sid\n* [[Hank Bell]] as Ranch Hand (uncredited) \n* [[Bob McKenzie (actor)|Bob McKenzie]] as Bartender Zeke (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted by [[Oliver H.P. Garrett]] and [[David O. Selznick]] from the novel by [[Niven Busch]]. The film proved to be a turbulent experience for Selznick and Vidor, with several directors being left uncredited for their work in the film, such as [[Josef von Sternberg]], [[William Dieterle]], [[William Cameron Menzies]], [[Otto Brower]], [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]] and Selznick himself.\n\nThe movie was filmed in [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>Schad, Jerry (2009).

It was called \"Lust in the Dust\", which eventually became the name of [[Lust in the Dust|another movie]]. A scene in which Pearl does a seductive dance for Lewton was cut from the film before it was released.<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/73733/Duel-in-the-Sun/articles.html</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSelznick had high hopes that ''Duel in the Sun'' would surpass his success with ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. The film received poor reviews, however, and was highly controversial due to its sexual content and to Selznick's real-life relationship with Jones, which broke up both of their marriages. Despite the bad press, which compared it with ''[[The Outlaw]]'', it was a box-office success for Selznick, although not a second ''Gone with the Wind''. It was shown at increased admission prices which boosted its earnings<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up|title=Upped Scale Films Cop 'Win, Place, Show' Spots in Gross Sweepstakes|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 1948|page=63|accessdate=June 11, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> to $11,300,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada during its initial release <ref>\"All Time Domestic Champs\", ''Variety'', 6 January 1960 p 34</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up|title=Top Grossers of 1947|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 1948|page=63|accessdate=June 11, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> and much more overseas and in the 1954 re-release. \n\nBecause of the film's huge production costs (rumored to be over $6,000,000), its $2,000,000 advertising campaign (unheard of at the time) and Selznick's costly distribution tactics, the film only broke even.<ref name=\"david\"/>\n\nIt was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] ([[Jennifer Jones]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] ([[Lillian Gish]]).\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film was one of the first to be honored by a record album, featuring selections from [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]'s musical score. Rather than use excerpts from the soundtrack, [[RCA Victor]] recorded some of the music with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arthur Fiedler]]. The music was split into approximately three-minute sections and released on 10-inch 78-rpm discs in 1946. A long musical prelude as well as an overture preceded the film with Tiomkin conducting the studio orchestra; this recording was later issued on LP and CD.\n\n''Duel in the Sun'' was first shown on American television during a special [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Sunday evening showing. It was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004.\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] has stated to James Lipton on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' that this was the first film he saw and holds it in high regard. He mentioned it in [[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies|his documentary]] of American movies.

Released in the postwar years during a period of economic boom and the changing role of women in society including marriage, sexuality and inclusion in the work force that left some Americans feeling alienated. Psychological westerns, popular in the 1940s, featured characters plagued by a dark torment that reflected the post-war attitudes. The march of progress is symbolized by an advancing railroad cutting across a senator's cattle lands. The film \"takes the moment of sadism exhibited in Ford's film and escalates it to extreme levels\".<ref name=marub2006>{{cite book |title=Killing the Indian Maiden: Images of Native American Women in Film |first=M.

After being raped by Lewt. Pearl is not able to meet the Victorian-era standards for moral conduct. Her identity as part Indian is \"linked to notions of uncontrollable drives, the fading of subjectivity, and the loss of conscious agency\". Believing she encouraged the rape, Jesse ends their romantic relationship. The \"dark\" or savage element of her sexuality and unrestrained passions has a racial dimension, contrasted with the white feminine ideal in the film's imagery, it is something needing to be tamed. She is \"too sexual to be a proper wife, too dark to be a comfortable part of [white] society, and too passionate to be controlled with anything but violence\".<ref name=marub2006 />\n\nAs Pearl is already \"spoiled\" by the rape she no longer needs to control her sexuality and enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with Lewt who treats her viciously and with racist abuse like calling her a \"bob-tailed little half-breed\". Marriage with Pearl is out of the question for Lewt due to his father's expectations that the family ranch not be \"turned into an Injun reservation\" though Lewt continues to exhibit jealous, controlling behaviors including murdering Jesse when he makes plans for Pearl to attend school in Austin. While in many ways the typical hero of American westerns, Lewt crosses over into the realm of the \"savage\" or \"unicivilized\". The violence Pearl encounters from Lewt leads her to develop gradually into a [[femme fatale]] type character who eventually murders him.<ref name=marub2006 />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1946]]\n* [[Lillian Gish filmography]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Duel in the Sun (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0038499}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|duel_in_the_sun|Duel in the Sun}}\n* {{Amg movie|14930}}\n* {{AFI film|id=24771}}\n\n{{King Vidor}}\n{{David O.

Selznick]], which tells the story of a [[Mestiza]] (half-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) girl who goes to live with her white relatives, becoming involved in prejudice and forbidden love. The [[Technicolor]] film stars [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lionel Barrymore]].\n\n==Plot==\nPearl Chavez is orphaned after her father Scott Chavez kills her mother, having caught her with a lover. Before Scott Chavez is executed as a punishment for killing his wife, he arranges for his daughter Pearl to live with his second cousin and old sweetheart, Laura Belle.\n\nArriving by stagecoach, Pearl is met by Jesse McCanles, one of Laura Belle's two grown sons. He takes her to Spanish Bit, their enormous cattle ranch. The gentle and gracious Laura Belle is happy to welcome her to their home, but not so her husband, the Senator Jackson McCanles, who uses a wheelchair. He calls Pearl \"a half-breed\" and jealously despises Pearl's father.\n\nThe second son, Lewt, is a ladies' man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the \"Sinkiller\", a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain \"a good girl.\"\n\nWhen she submits to Lewt's aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford, against the Senator's personal interests. Jesse is in love with Pearl but he leaves for [[Austin]] to pursue a political career and becomes engaged to Helen Langford, Langford's daughter.\n\nOffended when Lewt reneges on a promise to marry her, Pearl takes up with Sam Pierce, a neighboring rancher who is smitten with her. She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him.  Lewt becomes a wanted man.\n\nOn the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room.  Afterward, however, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.\n\nLaura Belle's health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up.  Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.\n\nThe Senator's old friend, Lem Smoot tells him that Jesse's wound is not mortal and the old man softens up towards his son and reconciles. A livid Pearl is relieved that Jesse is going to survive. When Helen arrives, she invites Pearl to leave Spanish Bit forever and come live with them in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Pearl agrees, but she is tipped off by one of the Spanish Bit hands, Sid that Lewt intends to come after Jesse again. She arms herself and engages in a shootout with Lewt in the desert, where they die in each other's arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as Pearl Chavez\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Jesse McCanles\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Lewton \"Lewt\" McCanles\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Senator Jackson McCanles\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Scott Chavez\n* [[Lillian Gish]] as Laura Belle McCanles\n* [[Walter Huston]] as Jubal Crabbe, The Sinkiller\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Sam Pierce\n* [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] as Lem Smoot\n* [[Charles Dingle]] as Sheriff Hardy\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as The \"Lover\" of Mrs. Chavez\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Vashti\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Mr. Langford\n* [[Joan Tetzel]] as Helen Langford\n* [[Tilly Losch]] as Mrs. Chavez \n* Scott McKay as Sid\n* [[Hank Bell]] as Ranch Hand (uncredited) \n* [[Bob McKenzie (actor)|Bob McKenzie]] as Bartender Zeke (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted by [[Oliver H.P. Garrett]] and [[David O. Selznick]] from the novel by [[Niven Busch]]. The film proved to be a turbulent experience for Selznick and Vidor, with several directors being left uncredited for their work in the film, such as [[Josef von Sternberg]], [[William Dieterle]], [[William Cameron Menzies]], [[Otto Brower]], [[Sidney Franklin]] and Selznick himself.\n\nThe movie was filmed in [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>Schad, Jerry (2009).

The film received poor reviews, however, and was highly controversial due to its sexual content and to Selznick's real-life relationship with Jones, which broke up both of their marriages. Despite the bad press, which compared it with ''[[The Outlaw]]'', it was a box-office success for Selznick, although not a second ''Gone with the Wind''.

Rather than use excerpts from the soundtrack, [[RCA Victor]] recorded some of the music with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arthur Fiedler]]. The music was split into approximately three-minute sections and released on 10-inch 78-rpm discs in 1946. A long musical prelude as well as an overture preceded the film with Tiomkin conducting the studio orchestra; this recording was later issued on LP and CD.\n\n''Duel in the Sun'' was first shown on American television during a special [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Sunday evening showing. It was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004.\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] has stated to James Lipton on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' that this was the first film he saw and holds it in high regard. He mentioned it in [[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies|his documentary]] of American movies.

Released in the postwar years during a period of economic boom and the changing role of women in society including marriage, sexuality and inclusion in the work force that left some Americans feeling alienated. Psychological westerns, popular in the 1940s, featured characters plagued by a dark torment that reflected the post-war attitudes.

Few spoke as loudly or as eloquently as he did for this reform. As a Member of Parliament, in 1914 and again in 1916 he introduced a bill to replace the death penalty with a life sentence. He opposed capital punishment on many grounds, considering it an insult to Christianity and religion in general and a blot on any civilized nation. \"There is nothing\", he stated in the house, \"more degrading to society at large&nbsp;... than the death penalty.\" He also spoke of class disparities, pointing out that the punishment was administered to the poor far more often than to the wealthy. He refuted the notion that state-sponsored killing acted as a deterrent to murder and cautioned against the possibility of mistake.<ref>Jedwar, ''Biography - BICKERDIKE, ROBERT''. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/bickerdike_robert_15E.html</ref>\n\nIn 1950, an attempt was made to abolish capital punishment. [[Ross Thatcher]], at that time a [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] Member of Parliament, moved Bill No. 2 in order to amend the Criminal Code to abolish the death penalty. Thatcher later withdrew it for fear of Bill No. 2 not generating positive discussion and further harming the chances of abolition. In 1956, the Joint Committee of the House and Senate recommended the retention of [[Mandatory death sentence|capital punishment as the mandatory punishment]] for murder, which opened the door to the possibility of abolition.<!-- How did a report recommending its retention open the door to abolition? --><ref>C.H.S.

''The Case of Valentine Shortis: A True Story of Crime and Politics in Canada'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-8020-6728-X}}, p.136</ref> Radclive is often described as having trained under British hangman [[William Marwood]] although there is no documentary proof for this. He can be shown to have hanged at least 69 people in Canada, although his life total was probably much higher. At his death, the ''Toronto Telegram'' said he had 150 executions. He died of alcohol-related illness in Toronto on February 26, 1911, at the age of 55.<ref>Patrick Cain, [https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/215835 \"The agony of the executioner\"], ''Toronto Star'', May 20, 2007</ref>\n\n* '''Arthur Ellis'''\nArthur Ellis was the [[pseudonym]] of [[Arthur B.

Ellis is prominently featured in the 2009 documentary ''[[Hangman's Graveyard]]''.\n\n* '''Camille Branchaud'''\nThe executioner who worked as Camille Branchaud, a pseudonym, succeeded Ellis. Branchaud was on the Quebec government payroll as a hangman, and executed people elsewhere in the country on a piecework basis. The hangman was traditionally based in Montreal where between 1912 and 1960 the gallows at [[Bordeaux Prison]] saw more executions (85) take place than any other correctional facility in Canada.<ref>Joint Committee on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries (Ottawa, Queen's Printer, 1955)</ref>\n\nBranchaud carried out many executions (for which he was not paid) in the postwar period in Canada, such as the double hanging of Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan of the [[Boyd Gang]] at the Don Jail in 1952, and [[Robert Raymond Cook]]'s execution in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1960.<ref>Hustak, Alan, 1944\u2013, They were hanged (Toronto, J. Lorimer, 1987)</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe first method of hanging was \"hoisting\" in which a rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The slip knot would then tightly close around the neck until [[strangulation]]. A variation of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart and then it would be pushed from under him. This led to the development of suspension in which \"the drop\" caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution.<ref>Anderson,'' Concise History'', 12.</ref> Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.<ref>Anderson, ''Concise History'', 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe majority of offenders put to death by Canadian civilian authorities were executed by the \"[[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]]\" technique of [[hanging]] developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[William Marwood]]. This method ensured that the prisoner's neck was broken instantly at the end of the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of [[asphyxia]] while unconscious, which was considered more humane than the slow death by [[strangulation]] which often resulted from the previous \"short drop\" method. The short drop sometimes gave a period of suffering before death finally took place.\n\nEarly in his career, John Radclive persuaded several sheriffs in Ontario and Quebec to let him use an alternative method in which the condemned person was jerked into the air. A gallows of this type was used for the execution of Robert Neil at Toronto's [[Don Jail]] on February 29, 1888:\n\n<blockquote>The old plan of a \"drop\" was discarded for a more merciful machine, by which the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution \u2026 At the words \"Forgive us our trespasses,\" the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron at the other end of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with a thud, and the [[Wiktionary:pinion#Verb|pinioned]] body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.<ref>''The Globe'', Wednesday, February 29, 1888, p. 8</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ont. in November 1890 seems to be the last time a device of this kind was used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a [[Royal Navy]] seaman helping with shipboard hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging a man on a ship's yardarm. After Birchall's hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.\n\nWhile hanging was a relatively humane method of execution under ideal conditions with an expert executioner, mistakes could and have happened. Condemned prisoners were decapitated by accident at Headingley Jail in Manitoba and Bordeaux Jail in Montreal, and a prisoner at the Don Jail in Toronto hit the floor of the room below and was strangled by the hangman.<ref name=\"Criminal Code 1937\">Minutes of proceedings and evidence \u2013 Special Committee on the Criminal Code (Death Penalty) (Ottawa, Printer to the King, 1937)</ref>\n\nSome Canadian jails\u2014such as those in Toronto, Whitby and Ottawa, Ontario; Headingley, Manitoba; and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta\u2014had permanent indoor execution facilities, but more typically offenders were hanged on a scaffold built for the occasion in the jail yard.\n\nMilitary prisoners sentenced to death under Canadian Military Law were [[Execution by firing squad|shot by a firing squad]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\n==Public opinion==\nAlthough reintroducing of the death penalty in Canada is extremely unlikely, support for capital punishment is similar to its support in the [[United States]], where it is carried out regularly in some states and is on the books in most states and on the federal level. While opposition to the death penalty increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, in recent years Canadians have merged closer to the US's position; in 2004 only 48 percent of Canadians favoured death for murderers compared to 62 percent in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadians-views-on-crime-are-hardening-poll-finds/article4311237/|title=Canadians' views on crime are hardening, poll finds|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> According to one poll, support for the death penalty in Canada is approximately the same as its support in the United States, at 63 percent in both countries as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/majority-canadians-support-death-penalty-poll-180253516.html|title=Majority of Canadians support the death penalty: poll|date=20 March 2013|work=Yahoo News Canada}}</ref> A 2011 poll by the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' found that 66 percent of Canadians favored capital punishment, but only 41 percent would actually support its re-introduction in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2011/01/25/17031401.html|title=Most Canadians say death penalty OK|work=Toronto Sun}}</ref>  A 2020 poll by Research Co. found that 51 percent of Canadians are in favour of reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country.

His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).\n\n== Policy regarding foreign capital punishment ==\n\nIn the 1990s, Canada extradited a criminal, [[Charles Ng]] to the United States, even though he appealed to the authorities, as he did not want to potentially face execution.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in the case ''[[United States v. Burns]]'', (2001), determined that Canada should not extradite persons to face trial in other countries for crimes punishable by death unless Canada has received an assurance that the foreign state will not apply the death penalty, essentially overruling ''[[Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)]]'', (1991). This is similar to the extradition policies of other nations such as [[Germany]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]] and [[Australia]], which also refuse to extradite prisoners who may be condemned to death. Extradition where the death penalty is possible was ruled a violation of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] in the case of ''[[Soering v United Kingdom]]'' outlawing the practice in member states of the [[Council of Europe]], of which all of the [[European Union]] member states are part.\n\nIn November 2007, Canada's [[Minority government|minority]] [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting [[clemency]] for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of [[Alberta]]-born [[Ronald Allen Smith]], who has been on death row in the [[United States]] since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister [[Stockwell Day]] to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2008/03/14/death-penalty.html|title=Day favours case-by-case approach to Canadians facing death penalty - Saskatchewan - CBC News|date=2012-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108214518/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2008/03/14/death-penalty.html|archive-date=2012-11-08|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\"<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120318000725/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/15/tasha%2Dkheiriddin%2Dstafford%2Dcase%2Dshows%2Dwhy%2Dcanada%2Dneeds%2Dthe%2Ddeath%2Dpenalty/ Tasha Kheiriddin: Tori Stafford case shows why Canada needs the death penalty] Accessed March 2012: \"Prior to the 2011 election, when asked about the subject in an interview by the CBC\u2019s Peter Mansbridge, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, 'I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.'\" \"So how do Canadians feel about the death penalty?

Few spoke as loudly or as eloquently as he did for this reform. As a Member of Parliament, in 1914 and again in 1916 he introduced a bill to replace the death penalty with a life sentence. He opposed capital punishment on many grounds, considering it an insult to Christianity and religion in general and a blot on any civilized nation. \"There is nothing\", he stated in the house, \"more degrading to society at large&nbsp;... than the death penalty.\" He also spoke of class disparities, pointing out that the punishment was administered to the poor far more often than to the wealthy. He refuted the notion that state-sponsored killing acted as a deterrent to murder and cautioned against the possibility of mistake.<ref>Jedwar, ''Biography - BICKERDIKE, ROBERT''. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/bickerdike_robert_15E.html</ref>\n\nIn 1950, an attempt was made to abolish capital punishment. [[Ross Thatcher]], at that time a [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] Member of Parliament, moved Bill No. 2 in order to amend the Criminal Code to abolish the death penalty. Thatcher later withdrew it for fear of Bill No. 2 not generating positive discussion and further harming the chances of abolition. In 1956, the Joint Committee of the House and Senate recommended the retention of [[Mandatory death sentence|capital punishment as the mandatory punishment]] for murder, which opened the door to the possibility of abolition.<!-- How did a report recommending its retention open the door to abolition? --><ref>C.H.S.

These were removed in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill C-25 1998|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?ls=C25&Parl=36&Ses=1#1) Abolition of the Death Penalty-text|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=8 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234747/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?ls=C25&Parl=36&Ses=1#1)|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn June 30, 1987, a bill to restore the death penalty was defeated by the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in a 148\u2013127 vote, in which Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[Ray Hnatyshyn]], and [[Minister of External Affairs (Canada)|Minister of External Affairs]] [[Joe Clark]] opposed the bill, whereas Deputy Prime Minister [[Donald Mazankowski]] and a majority of [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] MPs supported it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/crime-justice/the-death-penalty-debate/abolition-upheld.html|title=CBC Archives|date=10 April 2013|work=cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccadp.org/deathpenalty-canada.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019091212/http://ccadp.org/deathpenalty-canada.htm |archivedate=2011-10-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1127764--majority-of-canadians-support-return-of-death-penalty-poll-finds|title=Majority of Canadians support return of death penalty, poll finds|date=8 February 2012|work=thestar.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-02-14/news/8701100413_1_capital-punishment-death-penalty-special-committee|title=Canada Considers Restoring Death Penalty|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}</ref>\n\nFirst-degree murder, which before abolition was the offence of capital murder, now carries a mandatory life sentence without eligibility for [[parole]] until the person has served 25 years of the sentence.\n\n=== Last executions in Canada ===\nThe last two people executed in Canada were [[Ronald Turpin]], 29, and [[Arthur Lucas]], 54, convicted for separate murders, at 12:02 am on December 11, 1962, at the [[Don Jail]] in [[Toronto]].\n\nThe last woman to be hanged in Canada was [[Marguerite Pitre]] on January 9, 1953, for her part in the [[Albert Guay affair]].\n\nThe last person sentenced to death was [[Mario Gauthier]] on May 14, 1976, for the murder of a prison guard in [[Quebec]].

Most were shot for service offences such as [[desertion]] and [[cowardice]], but two executions were for [[murder]]. For details of these see ''[[List of Canadian soldiers executed during World War I]]''.\n\nOne Canadian soldier, Pte. [[Harold Pringle]], was executed during the Second World War for murder.\n\n=== Executioners ===\n* '''John Radclive'''\nJohn Radclive was Canada's first professional executioner, placed on the federal payroll as a hangman by a Dominion order-in-council in 1892, on the recommendation of the justice minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]]:<ref>Martin L. Friedland. ''The Case of Valentine Shortis: A True Story of Crime and Politics in Canada'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-8020-6728-X}}, p.136</ref> Radclive is often described as having trained under British hangman [[William Marwood]] although there is no documentary proof for this. He can be shown to have hanged at least 69 people in Canada, although his life total was probably much higher. At his death, the ''Toronto Telegram'' said he had 150 executions. He died of alcohol-related illness in Toronto on February 26, 1911, at the age of 55.<ref>Patrick Cain, [https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/215835 \"The agony of the executioner\"], ''Toronto Star'', May 20, 2007</ref>\n\n* '''Arthur Ellis'''\nArthur Ellis was the [[pseudonym]] of [[Arthur B. English]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] man who became Canada's official [[Executioner|hangman]] in 1913, after Radclive's death. Ellis worked as a hangman in Canada until the botched execution of Thomasina Sarao in Montreal in 1935, in which she was decapitated.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Headsman |title=1935: Thomasina Sarao, miscalculated |url=http://www.executedtoday.com/2010/03/29/1935-thomasina-sarao/ |website=www.executedtoday.com |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> He died in poverty in Montreal in July, 1938, and lies buried in the [[Mount Royal Cemetery]].\n\nThe [[Crime Writers of Canada]] present annual literary awards \u2013 the [[Arthur Ellis Awards]] \u2013 named after this pseudonym. Ellis is prominently featured in the 2009 documentary ''[[Hangman's Graveyard]]''.\n\n* '''Camille Branchaud'''\nThe executioner who worked as Camille Branchaud, a pseudonym, succeeded Ellis. Branchaud was on the Quebec government payroll as a hangman, and executed people elsewhere in the country on a piecework basis. The hangman was traditionally based in Montreal where between 1912 and 1960 the gallows at [[Bordeaux Prison]] saw more executions (85) take place than any other correctional facility in Canada.<ref>Joint Committee on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries (Ottawa, Queen's Printer, 1955)</ref>\n\nBranchaud carried out many executions (for which he was not paid) in the postwar period in Canada, such as the double hanging of Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan of the [[Boyd Gang]] at the Don Jail in 1952, and [[Robert Raymond Cook]]'s execution in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1960.<ref>Hustak, Alan, 1944\u2013, They were hanged (Toronto, J. Lorimer, 1987)</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe first method of hanging was \"hoisting\" in which a rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The slip knot would then tightly close around the neck until [[strangulation]]. A variation of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart and then it would be pushed from under him. This led to the development of suspension in which \"the drop\" caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution.<ref>Anderson,'' Concise History'', 12.</ref> Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.<ref>Anderson, ''Concise History'', 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe majority of offenders put to death by Canadian civilian authorities were executed by the \"[[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]]\" technique of [[hanging]] developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[William Marwood]]. This method ensured that the prisoner's neck was broken instantly at the end of the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of [[asphyxia]] while unconscious, which was considered more humane than the slow death by [[strangulation]] which often resulted from the previous \"short drop\" method. The short drop sometimes gave a period of suffering before death finally took place.\n\nEarly in his career, John Radclive persuaded several sheriffs in Ontario and Quebec to let him use an alternative method in which the condemned person was jerked into the air. A gallows of this type was used for the execution of Robert Neil at Toronto's [[Don Jail]] on February 29, 1888:\n\n<blockquote>The old plan of a \"drop\" was discarded for a more merciful machine, by which the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution \u2026 At the words \"Forgive us our trespasses,\" the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron at the other end of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with a thud, and the [[Wiktionary:pinion#Verb|pinioned]] body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.<ref>''The Globe'', Wednesday, February 29, 1888, p. 8</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ont. in November 1890 seems to be the last time a device of this kind was used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a [[Royal Navy]] seaman helping with shipboard hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging a man on a ship's yardarm. After Birchall's hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.\n\nWhile hanging was a relatively humane method of execution under ideal conditions with an expert executioner, mistakes could and have happened. Condemned prisoners were decapitated by accident at Headingley Jail in Manitoba and Bordeaux Jail in Montreal, and a prisoner at the Don Jail in Toronto hit the floor of the room below and was strangled by the hangman.<ref name=\"Criminal Code 1937\">Minutes of proceedings and evidence \u2013 Special Committee on the Criminal Code (Death Penalty) (Ottawa, Printer to the King, 1937)</ref>\n\nSome Canadian jails\u2014such as those in Toronto, Whitby and Ottawa, Ontario; Headingley, Manitoba; and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta\u2014had permanent indoor execution facilities, but more typically offenders were hanged on a scaffold built for the occasion in the jail yard.\n\nMilitary prisoners sentenced to death under Canadian Military Law were [[Execution by firing squad|shot by a firing squad]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\n==Public opinion==\nAlthough reintroducing of the death penalty in Canada is extremely unlikely, support for capital punishment is similar to its support in the [[United States]], where it is carried out regularly in some states and is on the books in most states and on the federal level. While opposition to the death penalty increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, in recent years Canadians have merged closer to the US's position; in 2004 only 48 percent of Canadians favoured death for murderers compared to 62 percent in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadians-views-on-crime-are-hardening-poll-finds/article4311237/|title=Canadians' views on crime are hardening, poll finds|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> According to one poll, support for the death penalty in Canada is approximately the same as its support in the United States, at 63 percent in both countries as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/majority-canadians-support-death-penalty-poll-180253516.html|title=Majority of Canadians support the death penalty: poll|date=20 March 2013|work=Yahoo News Canada}}</ref> A 2011 poll by the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' found that 66 percent of Canadians favored capital punishment, but only 41 percent would actually support its re-introduction in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2011/01/25/17031401.html|title=Most Canadians say death penalty OK|work=Toronto Sun}}</ref>  A 2020 poll by Research Co. found that 51 percent of Canadians are in favour of reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country. However, almost half of Canadians (47%) select life imprisonment without the possibility of parole over the death penalty (34%) as their preferred punishment in cases of murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://researchco.ca/2020/03/03/canada-us-death-penalty/|title=Death Penalty Splits Views in Canada and the United States|work=Research Co.}}</ref>\n\nSince abolition only two parties were known to have advocated to bringing it back: the  [[Reform Party of Canada]] (1988\u20132000) and the [[National Advancement Party of Canada]] (since 2014).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAmong the reasons cited for banning capital punishment in Canada were fears about [[wrongful conviction]]s, concerns about the state taking people's lives, and uncertainty about the death penalty's role as a deterrent for crime.<ref>[http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/ http://canada.justice.gc.ca]</ref> The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old [[Steven Truscott]] was a significant impetus (although certainly not the only one) toward the abolition of capital punishment.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Truscott was sentenced to death for the murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).\n\n== Policy regarding foreign capital punishment ==\n\nIn the 1990s, Canada extradited a criminal, [[Charles Ng]] to the United States, even though he appealed to the authorities, as he did not want to potentially face execution.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in the case ''[[United States v. Burns]]'', (2001), determined that Canada should not extradite persons to face trial in other countries for crimes punishable by death unless Canada has received an assurance that the foreign state will not apply the death penalty, essentially overruling ''[[Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)]]'', (1991). This is similar to the extradition policies of other nations such as [[Germany]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]] and [[Australia]], which also refuse to extradite prisoners who may be condemned to death. Extradition where the death penalty is possible was ruled a violation of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] in the case of ''[[Soering v United Kingdom]]'' outlawing the practice in member states of the [[Council of Europe]], of which all of the [[European Union]] member states are part.\n\nIn November 2007, Canada's [[Minority government|minority]] [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting [[clemency]] for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of [[Alberta]]-born [[Ronald Allen Smith]], who has been on death row in the [[United States]] since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister [[Stockwell Day]] to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2008/03/14/death-penalty.html|title=Day favours case-by-case approach to Canadians facing death penalty - Saskatchewan - CBC News|date=2012-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108214518/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2008/03/14/death-penalty.html|archive-date=2012-11-08|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\"<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120318000725/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/03/15/tasha%2Dkheiriddin%2Dstafford%2Dcase%2Dshows%2Dwhy%2Dcanada%2Dneeds%2Dthe%2Ddeath%2Dpenalty/ Tasha Kheiriddin: Tori Stafford case shows why Canada needs the death penalty] Accessed March 2012: \"Prior to the 2011 election, when asked about the subject in an interview by the CBC\u2019s Peter Mansbridge, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, 'I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.'\" \"So how do Canadians feel about the death penalty?

The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.\n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n*

When ''Dark Waters'' was released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped even further by 7.15 points from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by another PFAS manufacturing facility in that region.

The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.\n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Sarah Bilott\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Tom Terp\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Wilbur Tennant \n* [[Victor Garber]] as Phil Donnelly\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Darlene Kiger\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Harry Deitzler\n* [[William Jackson Harper]] as James Ross\n* [[Louisa Krause]] as Karla\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nOn September 21, 2018, it was announced that [[Todd Haynes]] would direct the film, then titled ''Dry Run'', from a script by [[Matthew Michael Carnahan]], which would be produced by [[Participant (company)|Participant Media]] along with [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/carol-todd-haynes-direct-dry-run-participant-media-1202469279/ |title='Carol' Helmer Todd Haynes To Direct 'Dry Run' Drama For Participant Media |last=N'Duka |first=Amanda |date=September 21, 2018  |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> In November 2018, Ruffalo was officially set to star in the film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/mark-ruffalo-confirmed-participant-media-todd-haynes-dupont-drama-movie-1202498626/ |title=Mark Ruffalo To Star In Participant Media's Todd Haynes Pic About DuPont Pollution Scandal |last=Wiseman |first=Andreas |date=November 9, 2018|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |language=en |access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tim Robbins]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Victor Garber]], [[Mare Winningham]], [[William Jackson Harper]], and [[Bill Pullman]] joined the cast of the film, with [[Christine Vachon]] and Pamela Koffler producing under their [[Killer Films]] banner.<ref name=\"MoreCast\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/anne-hathaway-tim-robbins-mark-ruffalo-todd-haynes-dupont-pollution-scandal-1202532048/ |title=Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, More Join Mark Ruffalo In Todd Haynes-Participant Drama About DuPont Pollution Scandal |last=Wiseman |first=Andreas |date=January 9, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began on January 14, 2019, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=\"MoreCast\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://local12.com/news/local/shooting-for-film-starring-mark-ruffalo-anne-hathaway-begins-in-hamilton-monday |title=Shooting for film starring Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway begins in Hamilton Monday |date=January 11, 2019 |website=Local12.com |access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released in limited theatres on November 22, 2019, before going wide on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Brueggemann|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/box-office-dark-waters-arthouse-openers-1202191841/|title=\u2018Dark Waters\u2019 Leads Tepid Arthouse Openers at Crowded Box Office|website=[[Indiewire]]|date=November 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\n''Dark Waters'' grossed $11.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $21 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> \n\nIn its opening weekend the film made $102,656 from four theaters, a per-venue average of $25,651.<ref name=\"indiewire\"/> It expanded to 94 theaters the following weekend, making $630,000.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brueggemann |first=Tom |url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/holiday-box-office-harriet-jojo-rabbit-two-popes-1202193331/ |title= 'Harriet,' 'Jojo Rabbit,' and 'Parasite' Reap Holiday Box Office Bounty |website=[[IndieWire]] |date=December 1, 2019 |accessdate=December 1, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film went wide in its third weekend of release, making $4.1 million from 2,012 theaters, and then made $1.9 million in its fourth weekend.<ref name=expand>{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title= \u2018Frozen 2\u2019 Leads Dreary December Weekend With $34M+, \u2018Playmobil\u2019 Plunges To $670K \u2013 Sunday Update |url= https://deadline.com/2019/12/frozen-2-already-past-300m-leading-dreary-december-weekend-with-40m-playmobil-coming-apart-1202802388/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=December 8, 2019|date= December 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/12/jumanji-the-next-level-richard-jewell-black-christmas-opening-weekend-box-office-1202808689/ |title=\u2018Jumanji: The Next Level\u2019 Advancing To $51M+ Opening; \u2018Richard Jewell\u2019 & \u2018Black Christmas\u2019 Earn Lumps Of Coal |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=December 15, 2019 |accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.

While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith.
