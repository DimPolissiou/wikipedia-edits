During the Neolithic period there were three cultural zones: the Adriatic in Herzegovina; the Pannonian-Balkan in Bosnia and the transitional zone between the two in the headwaters of the river of Bosnia. Bosnia and Herzegovina has many archaeological foundings from the Bronze to Iron Age. Throughout the Classical Age cultural and civilization layers of the [[Illyrians]] ([[Daorsi]] in eastern Herzegovina, [[Ardiaei]], [[Sardeates]], [[Japodi]], [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Breuci]], [[Autariatae]], [[Dalmatae]]  etc.), [[Celts]] ([[Scordisci]]), [[Thracians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Huns]], [[Germanic peoples]] ([[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]]) and others were formed, though the majority of the populace was [[Romanization|Romanized]] during the conquests at the beginning of the New Era. The Eastern Goths thrust into the area during the early Middle Ages, while [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] came in the 6th century.\n\n== Medieval ==\nDue to a variety of factors (such as frequent boundary shifts and a relative isolation from the rest of Europe) there are no detailed statistics dealing with Bosnia's population during the [[Middle Ages]]. It is generally estimated that the population of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] at the height of its power was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosna-hercegovina.info/povijest.htm|title=Povijet \u2013 istorija Bosne i Hercegovine|author=|date=|website=www.bosna-hercegovina.info|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> There were very few significant urban centers in Bosnia at this time, and even these paled in comparison to the far more urbanized areas along the nearby [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Among the more notable cities were [[Doboj]], [[Jajce]], [[Srebrenik]], [[Srebrenica]], [[Tesanj]] and [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]]. The overwhelming majority of the population was rural and the social organization of Medieval Bosnia developed into what was called ''[[Zadruga]]''. In this system, communities were organized by a few families of common interests usually situated in a cluster housing formation. Leaders of the community were selected according to their age and high ethical standards. Zadruga was primarily an agrarian community greatly dependent on natural resources.\n\n== Migrations and other ==\n\nThroughout the 15th\u201319th centuries there were many demographic changes.  Frequent wars, religious persecutions, rebellions, uprisings, taking of children as tribute, high [[tributes]], high [[taxes]], years of bad [[crops]], epidemics, [[violence]], and [[oppression]] have caused a high mortality rate and suffering of the whole population and instigated the migration flows that changed the ethnic structure of the population. So, with arrival of Ottoman Empire coincided with the process of Christian population emigration from these regions, which has remained the main feature of the demographic development of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the present day. At the same time, intense internal shifting of the population together with recurrent migrations and also immigrations changed the distribution of some [[ethnic]] groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Ottoman period. The later stages saw particularly [[Muslim]] migrations from the region.\n\nIn the Bosnia proper the population started to move out first from lower regions (Posavina and the river valleys) and then from highlands. The most intensive migration flows originated in the karst Dinaric regions of Herzegovina and western Bosnia. For centuries, the population from these regions, mostly Christian, headed towards surrounding countries):\n* The migrations from [[Bosnia|Western Bosnia]] (from [[Glamo\u010d]] and [[Unac River|Unac]], [[Kupres, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kupres]], [[Bosansko Grahovo|Grahovo]]) were heading towards [[Lika]], [[Croatia|Croatia proper]], and [[Slovenia]], and steady emigration flows from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]] headed towards [[Slavonia]], [[Syrmia]], [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]], and [[Baranja region|Baranja]].\n* Migrations from eastern Herzegovina and Upper Podrinje headed towards western [[Serbia]] and [[\u0160umadija]].\n* Migrations from the southern Dinaric region of Bosnia and Herzegovina headed towards Dalmatia. [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]] states that the first migrations to Dalmatia from the Dinaric hinterland started already at the end of the 12th century, and they became stronger in the Ottoman period from the 15th to the 18th century. Also these migrations shifted the medieval population of Dalmatia that had previously migrated mostly towards [[Croatia]], Slavonija, and Italy. According to Cviji\u0107, almost all of the population of [[Makarska]], [[Omi\u0161]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[\u0160ibenik]] and [[Bukovica, Croatia|Bukovica]] originated from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n* Of the [[Herzegovina]] origin were the inhabitants of the city of Dubrovnik and the vicinity, while the population of the Bay of Kotor originated from the Montenegrin and Herzegovina Dinaric regions.\n\nThroughout the 15th\u201319th centuries, with coming of the Ottoman Empire on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina the first significant demographic change took place as almost all followers of than [[Bosnian Church]] converted to Islam as a method of keeping the ownership of the land they owned before the Ottoman conquest. Their conversions were also of a political nature; while [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Catholic portions of the Bosnian population had their base in the Serbian Orthodox Church and Catholic Church, Bosnian church followers had no representation on a larger geopolitical scene. Added motivation were also tax reliefs for conversions to Islam.\nThere was also a great influx of Eastern Orthodox believers, due to the constant immigrations from Montegro and Serbia, frequent wars (Eastern Orthodox population participated as soldiers on both sides), and shortage of Catholic preachers.\n\nPreottoman Catholic population had a great share in the emigrations from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The emigration flows were directed towards Dalmatia, [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Baranja region|Baranja]] and north-west Ba\u010dka. The western part of today's [[Bosnia (region)|region of Bosnia]], today known as [[Bosnian Krajina]], was taken by the Ottomans in the 16th century, and was for some time still known as \"[[Turkish Croatia]]\", as its once overwhelming Catholic and Croat majority disappeared and the Ottomans entrenched the new border along the [[Sava]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]] rivers. After more than a century of military losses, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] waged some victorious wars against Turkey and managed to temporarily shift the border south of the [[Sava]] river with the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718), but this was undone as soon as the 1739 [[Treaty of Belgrade]] was signed.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/77458\n| language = Croatian\n| title = Posavska krajina/granica od 1718. do 1739. godine \u2013 The Sava military borderland, 1718 \u2013 1739\n| author = [[Drago Roksandi\u0107]], [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]]\n| publisher = [[University of Zagreb]]\n| date = 2007-10-02\n| accessdate = 2010-06-29\n}}</ref> Austria-Hungary would later take hold of the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]], but under different circumstances, leading up to the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908. Relatively few previous Croatian [[emigrants]] came back to Bosnia.\n\nAccording to the findings of many an author, the Muslim population, in the period of the Ottoman rule, did not emigrate much compared to the migrations of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic population. The Muslim population was characteristic of return migrations as soon as the political and economic situation again became stable or the state borders were shifted. The return movements of the Muslim population from the seaside, [[Lika]], [[Slavonia]], [[Hungary]], and other places are well known. For example, after the [[Siege of Vienna]] (1683\u20131699), territorial losses of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the conquest of [[Lika]] and [[Krbava]] by the Austrian Imperial Army, mass movements of the Muslim population from those regions took place; the Muslim population headed towards Biha\u0107, Cazin, and Bosanska Krupa where they created an enclave in the vast region of [[Bosnian Krajina|Bosnian Frontier]]. More intensified immigrations of the Muslim population were noticed in 1690 when they moved from Hungary and Slavonia to the region around the mountain of Majevica.\n\nIn the Ottoman period, the Muslim population increased in number in Bosnia and Herzegovina somewhat due to immigrations of Muslims from the [[Sanjaks]] of [[Smederevo]] and [[Novi Pazar]], and especially from some regions of [[Montenegro]], [[Sjenica]], and [[Pe\u0161ter]]. Immigrations of the Turkish population from [[Asia Minor]] also had an impact upon the growth of the Muslim population in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the 15th to 19th century.\n\nHowever, the increase of the Muslim population was mostly due to their high natality rate given the patriarchal nature of the family structure. In such family structure the duties of the family members were strictly divided where female members of the family almost solely were bearing many children and taking care of the household while male members were engaged in running the land and the politics of the community.\n\nPatriarchal structure was also evident in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic families but the statistics do not tend to show as high natality rates. The difference (according to some literary sources of the time) was in the social levels of Muslims relative to their Christian counterparts where the former were landowners and hence upper and upper middle class who could afford to have more offspring and the latter were land workers and hence lower middle to lower class. Such social organization corresponded to a [[feudal system]] of the time.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\n\nDuring and shortly after the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]], between 1463 and 1557, it is estimated that the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces took around 100,000 of Bosnia's inhabitants into captivity and 30,000 young into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] as a result of the ''[[devshirmeh]]'' (also known as ''blood tax'').\n\nThe first official population census by religion in Bosnia conducted:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He calls Bosnia \"land of Vostri\" and its population Vostri (or Bostri, Bostni), clearly distinguishing Bosnia population from populations of its neighbors, as even Serbian scholar Radi\u0107 Radivoj cites and explains in his study \"Bosnia in historical work of Critobulus of Imbros\":\n\n''Critobulus has extremely negative opinion of the Latins, while for other nations as to the Romeji, Serbs, Hungarians, and inhabitants of Bosnia \u2013 except Albanians and Vlachs for whom he has some hostilities \u2013 has a certain sympathy.''\n\nAnd later cites author writing of Bosnians as people called Vostri; Albanians called Illirians; and Serbs called Tribali:\n\n''\"Encouraged by all these benefits, Vostri never intend to comply to the Sultan or make contracts and pay him annual tribute, as did other neighbors Illyrians (as author called Albanians) and Tribals (as author called Serbs), nor to subordinate themselves to him in any way.\"''\n.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120718220135/http://scindeks.nb.rs/article.aspx?artid=0584-98880643140R] BOSNA U ISTORIJSKOM DELU KRITOVULA SA IMBROSA</ref>\n\nTurkish historian [[\u00d6mer L\u00fctf\u00fc Barkan]] conducted a population census based on religion in the Bosnian [[Sand\u017eak]] between 1520 and 1530. At that time, there were over 334,325 inhabitants, of whom 38,7% were followers of [[Islam]].\n\nDuring the late 16th century and early 17th century, according to various [[Austria]]n and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sources, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina#Medieval Bosnia|Bosnia]]'s entire [[nobility]], the greater part of her [[citizenry]] and a part of the [[serfdom]] were [[Muslims]], around ''75%'' of the population of the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian pashadom]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe Muslim population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during the late 18th century to the early 19th century, started to gradually drop due to frequent wars fought by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Muslims were required by Ottoman law to serve in the military, whereas Christians were not part of the army. With the created of independent states of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], migrations of Serbs to the two states were in massive waves in the 1810s, 1820s and 1870s.\n\nBoth [[Muslim]] and Christian populations were considerably thinned in the 18th century due to frequent plagues. In particular, a huge [[Pandemic|plague]] epidemic reportedly halved the entire population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between 1813 and 1815.\n\nIt is impossible to give a correct estimate of the population of Bosnia. Some writers state it a million, others at 920,000 and 840,000. Von Zeidlitz, (in his \"Brief Survey of Bosnia, Rascia, the Herzegovina, and Servia in 1829.), gives us in one portion of his work the following enumeration:\n\u2013 Bosniaks (the Aboriginal race) \u2013 250,000\n\u2013 Servians \u2013 120,000\n\u2013 Turks \u2013 240,000\n\u2013 Morlachians \u2013 75,000\n\u2013 Croats \u2013 40,000\n\u2013 Gypsies \u2013 16,000\n\u2013 Jews \u2013 2,000\n\u2013 Armenians \u2013 800\n\nMaking a total of 743,800.\n* 450,000 Muslims\n* 250,000 Catholics\n* 220,000 Eastern Orthodox\n* 2,000 Jews\n* 800 Armenians\n\n[[Johann Roskiewicz]] estimated the ethnic composition of the population in 1867 as:\n* In Bosnia:\n** 782,000 Slavs (which he called \"Croatians and Serbs\")\n** 9,000 [[Roma minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]] (which he called \"Gipsies\")\n** 5,000 Jews\n* In [[Herzegovina]]:\n** 227,000 Slavs\n** 2,500 Roma\n** 500 Jews\n\nBetween 1875 and 1876, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] population census by religion was conducted, but with vague, imprecise and varying figures, often favoring Muslims over Christians :\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n! Percentage range\n|-\n| [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]]\n| ''32.63%'' \u2013 ''46.6%''\n|-\n| [[Sunni Muslims]]\n| ''32.6%'' \u2013 ''51.9%''\n|-\n| [[Catholics|Catholic Christians]]\n| ''14.97%'' \u2013 ''20.17%''\n|}\n\nFinal results of Ottoman administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina was rearranging most of its religious and ethnical map.  New empire created mostly Muslim elites which made up the majority in most of the cities, as in the westernmost and easternmost borderparts of Bosnia (Cazin area, parts of Drina valley and larger area around Tuzla). Prewar catholic majority west of Vrbas (area was part of Croatian Kingdom before the Ottomans) had disappeared and was exchanged by Eastern Orthodox majority, due to constant immigration of Orthodox, shortage of Catholic priesthood and emigrations of Catholics from that area. Catholics also mostly disappeared from Eastern Bosnia (Srebrenica region was one of Hungarian banates) and dropped to a minority in northern Bosnia (except for large parts of Bosnian Posavina).  In central Bosnia Catholics dropped roughly to about one half of the population, and Herzegovina was basically divided into Catholic and Orthodox parts with a Muslim majority in most of the cities.\n\n=== Territorial distribution ===\n\nThe Muslim population was mostly urban and comprised the majority in most of Bosnia and Herzegovina towns ([[Sarajevo]], [[Tuzla]], [[Banja Luka]]) as in western ([[Cazin]]) and eastern borderparts (parts of Drina valley) of the country due to religious wars with neighbouring countries.\nIn general, Muslims were the dominant group in most developed urban centers of the country.\n\nMost of western parts of Bosnia, eastern parts of Herzegovina and parts of [[Drina]] valley had Eastern Orthodox majority.  Those were large, but mostly mountainous regions.  The re-establishment of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] in 1557 and shortage of catholic priesthood contributed greatly to preservation of [[Serbs|Serbian]] presence in these areas.\n\nThe Catholic population comprised majority in the most of the Herzegovina, Posavina and Central Bosnia.  The preservation of a Catholic presence in these areas was greatly contributed by the establishment of the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Order]], which acted against Catholic emigration.\n\nDue to the frequent migrations and religious wars, many of those areas contained few (or more) of small enclaves of people of other religions.\n\nBosnia accepted a wave of immigrants of Jews that were expelled from Spain since the 15th century. They settled in Sarajevo, [[Travnik]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Biha\u0107]]. The immigration of the [[Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[Aromanians|Vlachs and Cincars]], and [[Circassians]], in small numbers, coincided with the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  None of these groups considerably influenced the overall population structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDuring the liberation wars fought by the Serbs between 1875 and 1878, Bosnia and Herzegovina lost ''13,64%'' of its population (150,000 out of total 1,100,000) of whom most were [[Serbs]].\n\n== Austro-Hungarian Empire ==\n=== 1879 census ===\nThe Austro-Hungarian government published the ''Haupt-Uebersicht der politischen Eintheilung von Bosnien und der Hercegovina'', with demographics according to the census collected on 16 June 1879.<ref>{{cite document|title=Haupt-Uebersicht der politischen Eintheilung von Bosnien und der Hercegovina|year=1880|origyear=1879|publisher=|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Popis_1879_-_Bosna_i_Hercegovina.pdf}}</ref> The first thorough population census,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} it recorded 1,158,440 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by religion:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the Neolithic period there were three cultural zones: the Adriatic in Herzegovina; the Pannonian-Balkan in Bosnia and the transitional zone between the two in the headwaters of the river of Bosnia. Bosnia and Herzegovina has many archaeological foundings from the Bronze to Iron Age. Throughout the Classical Age cultural and civilization layers of the [[Illyrians]] ([[Daorsi]] in eastern Herzegovina, [[Ardiaei]], [[Sardeates]], [[Japodi]], [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Breuci]], [[Autariatae]], [[Dalmatae]]  etc.), [[Celts]] ([[Scordisci]]), [[Thracians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Huns]], [[Germanic peoples]] ([[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]]) and others were formed, though the majority of the populace was [[Romanization|Romanized]] during the conquests at the beginning of the New Era. The Eastern Goths thrust into the area during the early Middle Ages, while [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] came in the 6th century.\n\n== Medieval ==\nDue to a variety of factors (such as frequent boundary shifts and a relative isolation from the rest of Europe) there are no detailed statistics dealing with Bosnia's population during the [[Middle Ages]]. It is generally estimated that the population of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] at the height of its power was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosna-hercegovina.info/povijest.htm|title=Povijet \u2013 istorija Bosne i Hercegovine|author=|date=|website=www.bosna-hercegovina.info|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> There were very few significant urban centers in Bosnia at this time, and even these paled in comparison to the far more urbanized areas along the nearby [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Among the more notable cities were [[Doboj]], [[Jajce]], [[Srebrenik]], [[Srebrenica]], [[Tesanj]] and [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]]. The overwhelming majority of the population was rural and the social organization of Medieval Bosnia developed into what was called ''[[Zadruga]]''. In this system, communities were organized by a few families of common interests usually situated in a cluster housing formation. Leaders of the community were selected according to their age and high ethical standards. Zadruga was primarily an agrarian community greatly dependent on natural resources.\n\n== Migrations and other ==\n\nThroughout the 15th\u201319th centuries there were many demographic changes.  Frequent wars, religious persecutions, rebellions, uprisings, taking of children as tribute, high [[tributes]], high [[taxes]], years of bad [[crops]], epidemics, [[violence]], and [[oppression]] have caused a high mortality rate and suffering of the whole population and instigated the migration flows that changed the ethnic structure of the population. So, with arrival of Ottoman Empire coincided with the process of Christian population emigration from these regions, which has remained the main feature of the demographic development of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the present day. At the same time, intense internal shifting of the population together with recurrent migrations and also immigrations changed the distribution of some [[ethnic]] groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Ottoman period. The later stages saw particularly [[Muslim]] migrations from the region.\n\nIn the Bosnia proper the population started to move out first from lower regions (Posavina and the river valleys) and then from highlands. The most intensive migration flows originated in the karst Dinaric regions of Herzegovina and western Bosnia. For centuries, the population from these regions, mostly Christian, headed towards surrounding countries):\n* The migrations from [[Bosnia|Western Bosnia]] (from [[Glamo\u010d]] and [[Unac River|Unac]], [[Kupres, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kupres]], [[Bosansko Grahovo|Grahovo]]) were heading towards [[Lika]], [[Croatia|Croatia proper]], and [[Slovenia]], and steady emigration flows from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]] headed towards [[Slavonia]], [[Syrmia]], [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]], and [[Baranja region|Baranja]].\n* Migrations from eastern Herzegovina and Upper Podrinje headed towards western [[Serbia]] and [[\u0160umadija]].\n* Migrations from the southern Dinaric region of Bosnia and Herzegovina headed towards Dalmatia. [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]] states that the first migrations to Dalmatia from the Dinaric hinterland started already at the end of the 12th century, and they became stronger in the Ottoman period from the 15th to the 18th century. Also these migrations shifted the medieval population of Dalmatia that had previously migrated mostly towards [[Croatia]], Slavonija, and Italy. According to Cviji\u0107, almost all of the population of [[Makarska]], [[Omi\u0161]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[\u0160ibenik]] and [[Bukovica, Croatia|Bukovica]] originated from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n* Of the [[Herzegovina]] origin were the inhabitants of the city of Dubrovnik and the vicinity, while the population of the Bay of Kotor originated from the Montenegrin and Herzegovina Dinaric regions.\n\nThroughout the 15th\u201319th centuries, with coming of the Ottoman Empire on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina the first significant demographic change took place as almost all followers of than [[Bosnian Church]] converted to Islam as a method of keeping the ownership of the land they owned before the Ottoman conquest. Their conversions were also of a political nature; while [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Catholic portions of the Bosnian population had their base in the Serbian Orthodox Church and Catholic Church, Bosnian church followers had no representation on a larger geopolitical scene. Added motivation were also tax reliefs for conversions to Islam.\nThere was also a great influx of Eastern Orthodox believers, due to the constant immigrations from Montegro and Serbia, frequent wars (Eastern Orthodox population participated as soldiers on both sides), and shortage of Catholic preachers.\n\nPreottoman Catholic population had a great share in the emigrations from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The emigration flows were directed towards Dalmatia, [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Baranja region|Baranja]] and north-west Ba\u010dka. The western part of today's [[Bosnia (region)|region of Bosnia]], today known as [[Bosnian Krajina]], was taken by the Ottomans in the 16th century, and was for some time still known as \"[[Turkish Croatia]]\", as its once overwhelming Catholic and Croat majority disappeared and the Ottomans entrenched the new border along the [[Sava]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]] rivers. After more than a century of military losses, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] waged some victorious wars against Turkey and managed to temporarily shift the border south of the [[Sava]] river with the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718), but this was undone as soon as the 1739 [[Treaty of Belgrade]] was signed.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/77458\n| language = Croatian\n| title = Posavska krajina/granica od 1718. do 1739. godine \u2013 The Sava military borderland, 1718 \u2013 1739\n| author = [[Drago Roksandi\u0107]], [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]]\n| publisher = [[University of Zagreb]]\n| date = 2007-10-02\n| accessdate = 2010-06-29\n}}</ref> Austria-Hungary would later take hold of the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]], but under different circumstances, leading up to the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908. Relatively few previous Croatian [[emigrants]] came back to Bosnia.\n\nAccording to the findings of many an author, the Muslim population, in the period of the Ottoman rule, did not emigrate much compared to the migrations of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic population. The Muslim population was characteristic of return migrations as soon as the political and economic situation again became stable or the state borders were shifted. The return movements of the Muslim population from the seaside, [[Lika]], [[Slavonia]], [[Hungary]], and other places are well known. For example, after the [[Siege of Vienna]] (1683\u20131699), territorial losses of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the conquest of [[Lika]] and [[Krbava]] by the Austrian Imperial Army, mass movements of the Muslim population from those regions took place; the Muslim population headed towards Biha\u0107, Cazin, and Bosanska Krupa where they created an enclave in the vast region of [[Bosnian Krajina|Bosnian Frontier]]. More intensified immigrations of the Muslim population were noticed in 1690 when they moved from Hungary and Slavonia to the region around the mountain of Majevica.\n\nIn the Ottoman period, the Muslim population increased in number in Bosnia and Herzegovina somewhat due to immigrations of Muslims from the [[Sanjaks]] of [[Smederevo]] and [[Novi Pazar]], and especially from some regions of [[Montenegro]], [[Sjenica]], and [[Pe\u0161ter]]. Immigrations of the Turkish population from [[Asia Minor]] also had an impact upon the growth of the Muslim population in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the 15th to 19th century.\n\nHowever, the increase of the Muslim population was mostly due to their high natality rate given the patriarchal nature of the family structure. In such family structure the duties of the family members were strictly divided where female members of the family almost solely were bearing many children and taking care of the household while male members were engaged in running the land and the politics of the community.\n\nPatriarchal structure was also evident in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic families but the statistics do not tend to show as high natality rates. The difference (according to some literary sources of the time) was in the social levels of Muslims relative to their Christian counterparts where the former were landowners and hence upper and upper middle class who could afford to have more offspring and the latter were land workers and hence lower middle to lower class. Such social organization corresponded to a [[feudal system]] of the time.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\n\nDuring and shortly after the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]], between 1463 and 1557, it is estimated that the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces took around 100,000 of Bosnia's inhabitants into captivity and 30,000 young into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] as a result of the ''[[devshirmeh]]'' (also known as ''blood tax'').\n\nThe first official population census by religion in Bosnia conducted:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He calls Bosnia \"land of Vostri\" and its population Vostri (or Bostri, Bostni), clearly distinguishing Bosnia population from populations of its neighbors, as even Serbian scholar Radi\u0107 Radivoj cites and explains in his study \"Bosnia in historical work of Critobulus of Imbros\":\n\n''Critobulus has extremely negative opinion of the Latins, while for other nations as to the Romeji, Serbs, Hungarians, and inhabitants of Bosnia \u2013 except Albanians and Vlachs for whom he has some hostilities \u2013 has a certain sympathy.''\n\nAnd later cites author writing of Bosnians as people called Vostri; Albanians called Illirians; and Serbs called Tribali:\n\n''\"Encouraged by all these benefits, Vostri never intend to comply to the Sultan or make contracts and pay him annual tribute, as did other neighbors Illyrians (as author called Albanians) and Tribals (as author called Serbs), nor to subordinate themselves to him in any way.\"''\n.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120718220135/http://scindeks.nb.rs/article.aspx?artid=0584-98880643140R] BOSNA U ISTORIJSKOM DELU KRITOVULA SA IMBROSA</ref>\n\nTurkish historian [[\u00d6mer L\u00fctf\u00fc Barkan]] conducted a population census based on religion in the Bosnian [[Sand\u017eak]] between 1520 and 1530. At that time, there were over 334,325 inhabitants, of whom 38,7% were followers of [[Islam]].\n\nDuring the late 16th century and early 17th century, according to various [[Austria]]n and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sources, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina#Medieval Bosnia|Bosnia]]'s entire [[nobility]], the greater part of her [[citizenry]] and a part of the [[serfdom]] were [[Muslims]], around ''75%'' of the population of the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian pashadom]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe Muslim population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during the late 18th century to the early 19th century, started to gradually drop due to frequent wars fought by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Muslims were required by Ottoman law to serve in the military, whereas Christians were not part of the army. With the created of independent states of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], migrations of Serbs to the two states were in massive waves in the 1810s, 1820s and 1870s.\n\nBoth [[Muslim]] and Christian populations were considerably thinned in the 18th century due to frequent plagues. In particular, a huge [[Pandemic|plague]] epidemic reportedly halved the entire population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between 1813 and 1815.\n\nIt is impossible to give a correct estimate of the population of Bosnia. Some writers state it a million, others at 920,000 and 840,000. Von Zeidlitz, (in his \"Brief Survey of Bosnia, Rascia, the Herzegovina, and Servia in 1829.), gives us in one portion of his work the following enumeration:\n\u2013 Bosniaks (the Aboriginal race) \u2013 250,000\n\u2013 Servians \u2013 120,000\n\u2013 Turks \u2013 240,000\n\u2013 Morlachians \u2013 75,000\n\u2013 Croats \u2013 40,000\n\u2013 Gypsies \u2013 16,000\n\u2013 Jews \u2013 2,000\n\u2013 Armenians \u2013 800\n\nMaking a total of 743,800.\n* 450,000 Muslims\n* 250,000 Catholics\n* 220,000 Eastern Orthodox\n* 2,000 Jews\n* 800 Armenians\n\n[[Johann Roskiewicz]] estimated the ethnic composition of the population in 1867 as:\n* In Bosnia:\n** 782,000 Slavs (which he called \"Croatians and Serbs\")\n** 9,000 [[Roma minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]] (which he called \"Gipsies\")\n** 5,000 Jews\n* In [[Herzegovina]]:\n** 227,000 Slavs\n** 2,500 Roma\n** 500 Jews\n\nBetween 1875 and 1876, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] population census by religion was conducted, but with vague, imprecise and varying figures, often favoring Muslims over Christians :\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

New empire created mostly Muslim elites which made up the majority in most of the cities, as in the westernmost and easternmost borderparts of Bosnia (Cazin area, parts of Drina valley and larger area around Tuzla). Prewar catholic majority west of Vrbas (area was part of Croatian Kingdom before the Ottomans) had disappeared and was exchanged by Eastern Orthodox majority, due to constant immigration of Orthodox, shortage of Catholic priesthood and emigrations of Catholics from that area. Catholics also mostly disappeared from Eastern Bosnia (Srebrenica region was one of Hungarian banates) and dropped to a minority in northern Bosnia (except for large parts of Bosnian Posavina).  In central Bosnia Catholics dropped roughly to about one half of the population, and Herzegovina was basically divided into Catholic and Orthodox parts with a Muslim majority in most of the cities.\n\n=== Territorial distribution ===\n\nThe Muslim population was mostly urban and comprised the majority in most of Bosnia and Herzegovina towns ([[Sarajevo]], [[Tuzla]], [[Banja Luka]]) as in western ([[Cazin]]) and eastern borderparts (parts of Drina valley) of the country due to religious wars with neighbouring countries.\nIn general, Muslims were the dominant group in most developed urban centers of the country.\n\nMost of western parts of Bosnia, eastern parts of Herzegovina and parts of [[Drina]] valley had Eastern Orthodox majority.  Those were large, but mostly mountainous regions.  The re-establishment of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] in 1557 and shortage of catholic priesthood contributed greatly to preservation of [[Serbs|Serbian]] presence in these areas.\n\nThe Catholic population comprised majority in the most of the Herzegovina, Posavina and Central Bosnia.  The preservation of a Catholic presence in these areas was greatly contributed by the establishment of the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Order]], which acted against Catholic emigration.\n\nDue to the frequent migrations and religious wars, many of those areas contained few (or more) of small enclaves of people of other religions.\n\nBosnia accepted a wave of immigrants of Jews that were expelled from Spain since the 15th century. They settled in Sarajevo, [[Travnik]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Biha\u0107]]. The immigration of the [[Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[Aromanians|Vlachs and Cincars]], and [[Circassians]], in small numbers, coincided with the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  None of these groups considerably influenced the overall population structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDuring the liberation wars fought by the Serbs between 1875 and 1878, Bosnia and Herzegovina lost ''13,64%'' of its population (150,000 out of total 1,100,000) of whom most were [[Serbs]].\n\n== Austro-Hungarian Empire ==\n=== 1879 census ===\nThe Austro-Hungarian government published the ''Haupt-Uebersicht der politischen Eintheilung von Bosnien und der Hercegovina'', with demographics according to the census collected on 16 June 1879.<ref>{{cite document|title=Haupt-Uebersicht der politischen Eintheilung von Bosnien und der Hercegovina|year=1880|origyear=1879|publisher=|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Popis_1879_-_Bosna_i_Hercegovina.pdf}}</ref> The first thorough population census,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} it recorded 1,158,440 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by religion:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The town was named after the river, which was originally also named Rsha, probably from a [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] root *''rus'' 'slowly flowing.'<ref>E. M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow, 1998), p. 314.</ref>\n\nIn 1320, Orsha became a part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In 1398\u20131407, the Orsha castle was built. On September 8, 1514 the famous [[Battle of Orsha]] occurred, between allied [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] army.<ref name=\"baranauskas\">{{in lang|lt}} [http://www.delfi.lt/news/ringas/lit/article.php?id=10641866 Tomas Baranauskas.

In 1630, S. Sobal opened the first printing house at the [[Kuciejna]] monastery, which became a well-known centre of [[Cyrillic-alphabet]] publishing. The town was damaged during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)]], which was a disaster for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the [[Partitions of Poland|First Polish partition]] the city was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1772, and became part of the [[Mogilev|Mogilyov]] [[Guberniya|Gubernia]]. Under Russian rule, it was stripped of its Magdeburg Rights in 1776 and went into cultural and economic decline.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  The population dropped sharply to just about 2,000 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The city symbol in 1781 was changed to one which included the symbol of the [[Russian empire]] and five arrows.\n\n[[File:Vorsha saint illa 1880 2000.jpg|thumb|Orsha.

From February 2, 1919, Orsha became a part of Homyel region (Vitebsk region, 1920) of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]].  After the formation of the Soviet Union, it was transferred to the [[Byelorussian SSR]] in 1924.\n\nThe population before [[World War II]] was about 37,000. The city was occupied by Germany on July 16, 1941. The occupiers founded several concentration camps in the city, where an estimated 19,000 people were killed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nOrsha was one of the centers of the Belarusian general strike in April 1991. Hundreds of thousands of coal miners had been on strike across the Soviet Union since March 1. On April 3, the day after the central government had imposed consumer price increases, workers at several [[Minsk]] factories walked out raising the miners' demand for wages indexed to inflation. Virtually the entire labor force of that city followed on the 4th, joined soon thereafter by strikes across the Belarusian SSR. Mass demonstrations voted for additional demands (including the dissolution of the Union and Belarusian governments and the end of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party's]] privileges) and elected delegates from each enterprise to citywide strike committees, which in turn sent representatives to a central Belarusian Strike Committee (SKB). On April 23, the SKB resumed the general strike after the deadline for its demands to be met had passed. The next morning, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]], and leaders of eight of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] published a joint declaration in the papers agreeing to democratic elections for the Soviet parliament and the presidency, a new union treaty that would \"radically increase the role of the union republics,\" and measures to soften the impact of the price increase, but also the introduction of a \"special work regime\" in many industries.<ref>David Mandel, ''Perestroika and the Soviet People: Rebirth of the Labour Movement'' (1991).</ref>\n\nIn response, the Orsha strike committee issued a proposal for all local workers to block the railway junction, strategically located on the line linking [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] to Eastern and Western Europe. This was quickly endorsed by votes to \"lie down on the rails\" at a citywide meeting at the railway station. On the 25th, the Belarusian authorities concentrated the republic's KGB and riot police forces on Orsha, but were resisted by the strikers who sent fuel trains primed to explode down the tracks. Gorbachev mobilized the nearby military forces in [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]] with instructions to restore order over the railway; however many officers declared their refusal to comply, and brigade commander Gennady Sidorov professed a \"lack of understanding\" of the mission. Meanwhile, workers in other cities throughout Belarus held rallies threatening to retaliate if a drop of blood was shed in Orsha.\nFearing a clash, and seizing on the government's offer to negotiate with its representatives and grant it radio and air time, the SKB suspended the general strike that evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basta-news.net/03041991/|title=Basta!  \u00bb \u0421 \u0414\u041d\u0401\u041c \u0412\u0421\u0415\u0411\u0415\u041b\u0410\u0420\u0423\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0421\u041e\u041b\u0418\u0414\u0410\u0420\u041d\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418!|website=basta-news.net|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nThe [[bandy]] club [[Start (Orsha bandy club)|Start]] has produced players for the [[Belarus national bandy team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandy2008.ru/by-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-blr-teamroster-eng.pdf|title=bandy2008.ru|website=www.bandy2008.ru|url-status=dead|accessdate=13 January 2018}}{{cbignore|date=October 2018}} <!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20110904234152/http://www.bandy2008.ru/by-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-blr-teamroster-eng.pdf is broken, only shows a blank page --></ref><ref>http://www.bandyvm.se/eng2/read.asp?newsID=103</ref>\n\n=== Population change ===\n* 16th-17th century: est. 5,000\n* 1776: less than 2,000{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n* 1939: 37,000\n* 1970: 100,000\n* 2004: 125,000\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Vorsha railway station 2005.jpg|thumb|Railway station.]]\n\nOrsha became an important transportation center after the construction of a Dnieper River port.

Before 1987 there were less than 100 new cancer patients registered each year. Since then the number grew fivefold, with more than 500 new patients registered per year as of 2004. The biggest growth was registered in 2003\u201304 (178%). This was widely reported in independent media, but Belarusian officials are silent about the alarming health situation and possible reasons for this high cancer rate. Two possible factors mentioned in the independent media are old Soviet military installations in Orsha, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]].\n\n==Famous natives of Orsha==\n{{Category see also|People from Orsha}}\n[[File:Igor Zhelezovski 1985.jpg|thumb|265px|[[Igor Zhelezovski]]]]\n*[[Francis Dzierozynski]], [[Jesuit]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101125937/http://www.plakaty.ru/authors?id=542&sort=lname Piotra Holub (Golub Petr Semionovich) (1913\u20131953)], artist, author of many well-known [[Soviet propaganda]] posters, such as \"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0443\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0448\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\" and many others\n* [[Uladzimir Karatkievich]], Belarusian writer\n* [[Mikhail Marynich]], opposition politician, who was imprisoned in Orsha \n* [[Georgy Mondzolevsky]], 2-time Olympic volleyball champion\n* [[Gershon Shufman]], Hebrew author, known as 'Gimel Shufman'\n* [[Frida Vigdorova]], Soviet writer and journalist, famous for writing \"White book\" after [[Joseph Brodsky]] trial, in support of human rights in USSR ([[:ru:\u0412\u0438\u0433\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0424\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430]])\n* [[Lev Vygotsky]], psychologist\n* [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0953515 Nathan Zarkhi (1900\u20131935)], Soviet playwright and film writer\n* [[Faina Chiang]], became first lady of the [[Republic of China]] in 1978.\n* [[Igor Zhelezovsky]], Olympic medalist speed skater\n* [[Alina Talay]], (born 1989), [[track and field]] athlete\n* Some legends state that the unknown father of Belarusian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] was a peasant from Orsha.\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Belarus}}\n\nOrsha is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b|url=http://orsha.vitebsk-region.gov.by/ru/goroda-pobratimy/|website=orsha.vitebsk-region.gov.by|publisher=Orsha|language=ru|accessdate=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Asha, Russia|Asha]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|MDA}} [[B\u0103l\u021bi]], Moldova\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Bondeno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Cherkasy]], Ukraine\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Dubna]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|Gagarin]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Ivanovo]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Ivanteyevka, Moscow Oblast|Ivanteyevka]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kardymovsky District]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Koptevo District|Koptevo (Moscow)]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnogvardeysky District, Saint Petersburg|Krasnogvardeysky (Saint Petersburg)]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|LVA}} [[M\u0101rupe Municipality|M\u0101rupe]], Latvia\n<!--Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki - not twinning-->\n*{{flagicon|BUL}} [[Pernik Municipality|Pernik]], Bulgaria\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg|Pushkin]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Qingdao]], China\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Shishou]], China\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Silifke]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Smolensk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Spitak]], Armenia\n*{{flagicon|LTU}} [[Tel\u0161iai District Municipality|Tel\u0161iai]], Lithuania\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Tver]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Vaulx-en-Velin]], France\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Volgodonsk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Vyazma]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Yiwu]], China\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Zapadnoye Degunino District|Zapadnoye Degunino (Moscow)]], Russia\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Or\u0161a}}\n* [http://krasnyborets.com RUPE \"Machine-tool plant \"Krasny borets\"]\n* [http://www.orsha-sity.info Orsha - city \u041e\u0440\u0448\u0430 - \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438!]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204123649/http://txt.knihi.com/hierb/vorsa.gif Coat of Arms] (GIF file)\n* [http://radzima.org/pub/miesta.php?miesta_id1=viarvors Photos on Radzima.org]\n* [http://www.autoorsha.com/maps/belarus/vit_obl/orsha.jpg Map of Orsha]\n* [http://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/newsletter/orsha.htm Memories from a childhood in Orsha]\n* [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=143&letter=O Jewish Encyclopedia]\n* [http://orshagorodmoy.info/ \u041e\u0440\u0448\u0430 - \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u043c\u043e\u0439!

The town was damaged during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)]], which was a disaster for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the [[Partitions of Poland|First Polish partition]] the city was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1772, and became part of the [[Mogilev|Mogilyov]] [[Guberniya|Gubernia]].

From February 2, 1919, Orsha became a part of Homyel region (Vitebsk region, 1920) of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]].  After the formation of the Soviet Union, it was transferred to the [[Byelorussian SSR]] in 1924.\n\nThe population before [[World War II]] was about 37,000. The city was occupied by Germany on July 16, 1941. The occupiers founded several concentration camps in the city, where an estimated 19,000 people were killed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nOrsha was one of the centers of the Belarusian general strike in April 1991. Hundreds of thousands of coal miners had been on strike across the Soviet Union since March 1. On April 3, the day after the central government had imposed consumer price increases, workers at several [[Minsk]] factories walked out raising the miners' demand for wages indexed to inflation. Virtually the entire labor force of that city followed on the 4th, joined soon thereafter by strikes across the Belarusian SSR. Mass demonstrations voted for additional demands (including the dissolution of the Union and Belarusian governments and the end of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party's]] privileges) and elected delegates from each enterprise to citywide strike committees, which in turn sent representatives to a central Belarusian Strike Committee (SKB). On April 23, the SKB resumed the general strike after the deadline for its demands to be met had passed. The next morning, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]], and leaders of eight of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] published a joint declaration in the papers agreeing to democratic elections for the Soviet parliament and the presidency, a new union treaty that would \"radically increase the role of the union republics,\" and measures to soften the impact of the price increase, but also the introduction of a \"special work regime\" in many industries.<ref>David Mandel, ''Perestroika and the Soviet People: Rebirth of the Labour Movement'' (1991).</ref>\n\nIn response, the Orsha strike committee issued a proposal for all local workers to block the railway junction, strategically located on the line linking [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] to Eastern and Western Europe. This was quickly endorsed by votes to \"lie down on the rails\" at a citywide meeting at the railway station. On the 25th, the Belarusian authorities concentrated the republic's KGB and riot police forces on Orsha, but were resisted by the strikers who sent fuel trains primed to explode down the tracks. Gorbachev mobilized the nearby military forces in [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]] with instructions to restore order over the railway; however many officers declared their refusal to comply, and brigade commander Gennady Sidorov professed a \"lack of understanding\" of the mission. Meanwhile, workers in other cities throughout Belarus held rallies threatening to retaliate if a drop of blood was shed in Orsha.\nFearing a clash, and seizing on the government's offer to negotiate with its representatives and grant it radio and air time, the SKB suspended the general strike that evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basta-news.net/03041991/|title=Basta!  \u00bb \u0421 \u0414\u041d\u0401\u041c \u0412\u0421\u0415\u0411\u0415\u041b\u0410\u0420\u0423\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0421\u041e\u041b\u0418\u0414\u0410\u0420\u041d\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418!|website=basta-news.net|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nThe [[bandy]] club [[Start (Orsha bandy club)|Start]] has produced players for the [[Belarus national bandy team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandy2008.ru/by-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-blr-teamroster-eng.pdf|title=bandy2008.ru|website=www.bandy2008.ru|url-status=dead|accessdate=13 January 2018}}{{cbignore|date=October 2018}} <!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20110904234152/http://www.bandy2008.ru/by-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-blr-teamroster-eng.pdf is broken, only shows a blank page --></ref><ref>http://www.bandyvm.se/eng2/read.asp?newsID=103</ref>\n\n=== Population change ===\n* 16th-17th century: est. 5,000\n* 1776: less than 2,000{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n* 1939: 37,000\n* 1970: 100,000\n* 2004: 125,000\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Vorsha railway station 2005.jpg|thumb|Railway station.]]\n\nOrsha became an important transportation center after the construction of a Dnieper River port.

Two possible factors mentioned in the independent media are old Soviet military installations in Orsha, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]].\n\n==Famous natives of Orsha==\n{{Category see also|People from Orsha}}\n[[File:Igor Zhelezovski 1985.jpg|thumb|265px|[[Igor Zhelezovski]]]]\n*[[Francis Dzierozynski]], [[Jesuit]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101125937/http://www.plakaty.ru/authors?id=542&sort=lname Piotra Holub (Golub Petr Semionovich) (1913\u20131953)], artist, author of many well-known [[Soviet propaganda]] posters, such as \"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0443\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0448\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\" and many others\n* [[Uladzimir Karatkievich]], Belarusian writer\n* [[Mikhail Marynich]], opposition politician, who was imprisoned in Orsha \n* [[Georgy Mondzolevsky]], 2-time Olympic volleyball champion\n* [[Gershon Shufman]], Hebrew author, known as 'Gimel Shufman'\n* [[Frida Vigdorova]], Soviet writer and journalist, famous for writing \"White book\" after [[Joseph Brodsky]] trial, in support of human rights in USSR ([[:ru:\u0412\u0438\u0433\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0424\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430]])\n* [[Lev Vygotsky]], psychologist\n* [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0953515 Nathan Zarkhi (1900\u20131935)], Soviet playwright and film writer\n* [[Faina Chiang]], became first lady of the [[Republic of China]] in 1978.\n* [[Igor Zhelezovsky]], Olympic medalist speed skater\n* [[Alina Talay]], (born 1989), [[track and field]] athlete\n* Some legends state that the unknown father of Belarusian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] was a peasant from Orsha.\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Belarus}}\n\nOrsha is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b|url=http://orsha.vitebsk-region.gov.by/ru/goroda-pobratimy/|website=orsha.vitebsk-region.gov.by|publisher=Orsha|language=ru|accessdate=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Asha, Russia|Asha]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|MDA}} [[B\u0103l\u021bi]], Moldova\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Bondeno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Cherkasy]], Ukraine\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Dubna]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|Gagarin]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Ivanovo]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Ivanteyevka, Moscow Oblast|Ivanteyevka]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kardymovsky District]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Koptevo District|Koptevo (Moscow)]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnogvardeysky District, Saint Petersburg|Krasnogvardeysky (Saint Petersburg)]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|LVA}} [[M\u0101rupe Municipality|M\u0101rupe]], Latvia\n<!--Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki - not twinning-->\n*{{flagicon|BUL}} [[Pernik Municipality|Pernik]], Bulgaria\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg|Pushkin]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Qingdao]], China\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Shishou]], China\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Silifke]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Smolensk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Spitak]], Armenia\n*{{flagicon|LTU}} [[Tel\u0161iai District Municipality|Tel\u0161iai]], Lithuania\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Tver]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Vaulx-en-Velin]], France\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Volgodonsk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Vyazma]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Yiwu]], China\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Zapadnoye Degunino District|Zapadnoye Degunino (Moscow)]], Russia\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Or\u0161a}}\n* [http://krasnyborets.com RUPE \"Machine-tool plant \"Krasny borets\"]\n* [http://www.orsha-sity.info Orsha - city \u041e\u0440\u0448\u0430 - \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438!]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204123649/http://txt.knihi.com/hierb/vorsa.gif Coat of Arms] (GIF file)\n* [http://radzima.org/pub/miesta.php?miesta_id1=viarvors Photos on Radzima.org]\n* [http://www.autoorsha.com/maps/belarus/vit_obl/orsha.jpg Map of Orsha]\n* [http://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/newsletter/orsha.htm Memories from a childhood in Orsha]\n* [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=143&letter=O Jewish Encyclopedia]\n* [http://orshagorodmoy.info/ \u041e\u0440\u0448\u0430 - \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u043c\u043e\u0439!

Oroville is a member municipality of [[Okanogan County, Washington|Okanogan County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], situated between [[Omak, Washington|Omak]] and [[Penticton]]. The population was 1,686 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nOroville was first settled by Caucasian settlers in the late 1850s and known as 'rag town.' The settlement was named Oro, after the Spanish word for [[gold]], in 1892 after the surrounding gold mines and in an attempt to attract prospectors and merchants. The Post Office objected to the name \"Oro\" because a town was already named \"[[Oso, Washington|Oso]]\" in Washington, so the name was changed to Oroville,<ref>Gulick, Bill. ''A Traveler's History of Washington.'' Caxton Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87004-371-4}}. p. 340</ref> in 1909.

The city had an economy peak in 2005\u20132007, but has continued suffering since to the 'great recession.' It is home to the [[Dorothy Scott Airport]], an international municipal airport with U.S. Customs check, located two miles outside of the town center that was opened in August 1937.<ref name=airnav>{{cite web |url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/0S7 |title=Dorothy Scott Airport |publisher=[[Airnav.com|AirNav]] |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=basic>{{cite web |title=Airport Identification Information |url=http://wsdot.wa.gov/aviation/planning/systemplan/conditionassessment/ReportViewer.aspx |publisher=[[Washington (state)|Washington]] |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOroville is located {{convert|4|mi|km}} south of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], and features an official [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|crossing]] into [[Osoyoos, British Columbia]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is located at the south end of [[Osoyoos Lake]], which empties into the [[Okanogan River]] on the east side of the town; the town is bound to the west by the [[Similkameen River]].

[[Okanagan Highland|Okanogan Highlands]] in north-central [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. Oroville is a member municipality of [[Okanogan County, Washington|Okanogan County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], situated between [[Omak, Washington|Omak]] and [[Penticton]]. The population was 1,686 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nOroville was first settled by Caucasian settlers in the late 1850s and known as 'rag town.' The settlement was named Oro, after the Spanish word for [[gold]], in 1892 after the surrounding gold mines and in an attempt to attract prospectors and merchants. The Post Office objected to the name \"Oro\" because a town was already named \"[[Oso, Washington|Oso]]\" in Washington, so the name was changed to Oroville,<ref>Gulick, Bill. ''A Traveler's History of Washington.'' Caxton Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87004-371-4}}. p. 340</ref> in 1909. Passenger train service to Oroville was operated by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] until July 14, 1953, with freight operations continuing later.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barta |first=Linda |date=March 13, 2014 |title=Old news: Last run for passenger train |url=https://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/local/old-news-last-run-for-passenger-train/article_cd2624c0-8b7c-5b86-9c61-3d651cf0f9f6.html |work=[[The Wenatchee World]] |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOroville started to become a tourist location; in the mid-2000s, large condo developments were proposed. The city had an economy peak in 2005-2007, but has continued suffering since to the 'great recession.' It is home to the [[Dorothy Scott Airport]], an international municipal airport with U.S. Customs check, located two miles outside of the town center that was opened in August 1937.<ref name=airnav>{{cite web |url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/0S7 |title=Dorothy Scott Airport |publisher=[[Airnav.com|AirNav]] |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=basic>{{cite web |title=Airport Identification Information |url=http://wsdot.wa.gov/aviation/planning/systemplan/conditionassessment/ReportViewer.aspx |publisher=[[Washington (state)|Washington]] |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOroville is located {{convert|4|mi|km}} south of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], and features an official [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|crossing]] into [[Osoyoos, British Columbia]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is located at the south end of [[Osoyoos Lake]], which empties into the [[Okanogan River]] on the east side of the town; the town is bound to the west by the [[Similkameen River]].

Numerous orchards and a few grape vineyards are within the town limits. During Oroville's heyday as a mining town, many saloons, restaurants, shops, and a drive-in movie theater were there.<ref>http://www.drive-ins.com/theater/watorov</ref>  Today, the town's economy is depressed with a nearly 30% poverty rate and a median household income of only $22,000.  Recently, three vacation cottage developments have been built, two east of [[Lake Osoyoos]], Sandalia, and the Veranda Beach Resort, and one just north of downtown, Sonora Shores.\n\nThe city is home to a weekly newspaper, the ''Okanogan Valley Gazette-Tribune'', established in 1905 as the ''Oroville Weekly Gazette''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oroville Gazette|url=https://blogs.sos.wa.gov/newspapers/index.php/newspaper-profiles/oroville-gazette/|publisher=Washington Secretary of State|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1910= 495\n|1920= 1013\n|1930= 800\n|1940= 1206\n|1950= 1500\n|1960= 1437\n|1970= 1555\n|1980= 1483\n|1990= 1505\n|2000= 1653\n|2010= 1686\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1681\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web |date=June 27, 2019 |title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAt the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] there were 1,686 people in 698 households, including 434 families, in the city.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town is 41,011, an increase from 29,700 in [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. Dubbed the \"Upscale Tech Mecca\" of Southern Arizona by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' newspaper, Oro Valley is home to over 10 [[high tech]] firms and has a [[median household income]] nearly 50% higher than the [[Household income in the United States|U.S. median]]. The town is located approximately {{convert|110|mi|km}} southeast of the state capital of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nOro Valley is situated in the western foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] at the base of [[Pusch Ridge]]. The [[Tortolita Mountains]] are located north of the town, and vistas of the Tucson valley are to the south. The town occupies the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.  Oro Valley hosts a large number of residents from around the US who maintain second or winter homes in the town.\n\nThe town hosted the 2006 [[Pac-10]] Women's Golf Championships at the [[Oro Valley Country Club]]. Oro Valley Country Club was also the site for the 2006 Girl's Junior America's Cup, a major [[amateur]] [[golf tournament]] for the [[Western United States]]  Annual events in Oro Valley include the Oro Valley Festival of the Arts, El Tour de Tucson [[bicycle race]], the Tucson Marathon, the Cactus Speed Classic for [[inline skating|inline skaters]], and the Arizona Distance Classic.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Pre-U.S. annexation period===\nThe area of Oro Valley has been inhabited discontinuously for nearly two thousand years by various groups of people. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Hohokam]] tribe lived in the Honeybee Village in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains on Oro Valley's far north side around 450 A.D. Hohokam artifacts continue to be discovered in the Honeybee Village that the Hohokam inhabited continuously for nearly 800 years, and studied by archaeologists around the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orovalleyaz.gov/parksandrec/historic-preservation-cultural-resources/native-american-culture-and-history/honey-bee|title=Honey Bee Vilage|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Honey Bee Village {{!}} Oro Valley|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 16th century, Native American tribes known as the [[Apache]] arrived in the southern Arizona area, including Oro Valley. These tribes inhabited the region only a few decades prior to the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], including [[Francisco Coronado]]. The Spanish established [[forts]] in the area, including the Presidio at Tucson (1775) beginning in the late 16th century.\n\n===Arizona Territorial period===\nBeginning in the 19th century, Americans increasingly settled in the [[Arizona Territory]], following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the subsequent [[Gadsden Purchase]] including Southern Arizona. Following the Civil War and several Army efforts to pacify the Apaches, Tucson settlers ventured north to settle Oro Valley. Francisco Romero, from a Hispanic family tracing its Tucson roots to the early nineteenth century, established a ranch in what is Catalina State Park today by 1869.  He constructed ranch buildings on the foundations of the Hohokam ruins in the park. Romero lived there intermittently from 1869 to his death in 1905. Members of the Romero family occupied land in that same area until 1930. <Francisco Romero Biofile, Arizona Historical Society><Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGeorge Pusch, a [[German people|German]] immigrant, occupied land in the area of Oro Valley after 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the [[Ca\u00f1ada del Oro]]. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. Pusch and his family never lived on the ranch.  They visited frequently and employed caretakers to manage the property. George Pusch, and later the Pusch Land and Cattle Company, owned Steam Pump Ranch until 1925. Pusch's ranch provided respite for settlers and travelers entering and leaving the Tucson area. Pusch Ridge is named in honor of George Pusch.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n[[Ranching]]  continued to flourish in the area as greater numbers of Americans settled in the Arizona Territory and the state of Arizona. Federal homesteads became available after 1903 when surveys of land were completed. Homesteads were claimed by individuals from 1903 until the 1940s. Hispanic homesteaders included Francisco Romero, Jesus Elias, Francisco Marin, Francisco Aragon and others. Female homesteaders included Ina Gittings, Mabel Burke Johnson, Margaret Moodie and others.  Other prominent homesteaders included William Sutherland, James Reidy and David Morgan. <www.glorecords.gov>\n\nLarge ranching families came to the Oro Valley area in the period 1930\u20131960. Many of these were wealthy individuals from the Midwest and the East.  They vacationed in Tucson during the period and became interested in living in the desert. They purchased many of the homesteads occupied by original settlers who sold out after 1930.  These wealthy ranchers obtained properties of 1000 to 7000 acres.  They usually lived on the ranches in the winter months and employed caretakers to manage the property and cattle.  These wealthy ranchers included Walter McDonald, John Procter, Lawrence Rooney, Joseph McAdams and Lloyd and Betty Golder.<Williams,James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGold rushers into the [[American West]] also were attracted to [[southern Arizona]], where gold was said to be in abundance in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. Fueled by the legend of the lost Iron Door Gold Mine in the mountains, those in search of gold trekked through the Oro Valley area focusing their attention along the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro washbed.  No significant amounts of gold were found locally.\n\n===Post-World War II period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the Tucson area experienced dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. Property owners began subdividing local real estate for development in the early 1930s.  Construction of Campo Bello, the first suburban development, began in 1948. Lots in the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts were sold from the late 1930s to the 1960s and occupied by residents.  In the early 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club opened at the base of Pusch Ridge, affirming the area's future as an affluent community. The Suffolk Hills development was constructed in the period 1960\u20131962. Although one [[tract housing]] development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n===Founding of the town===\nThe community continued to grow gradually, and area residents increasingly desired local control of the land in the area. In the late 1960s, incorporation became a greater focus in Oro Valley.  Tucson Mayor James M. Corbett, Jr. expressed great interest in expanding the Tucson city limits to the far north side of [[Pima County]]. Corbett vowed to bring the Oro Valley area into Tucson \"kicking and screaming,\" alluding to the reservations Oro Valley residents expressed in joining Tucson.\n\nA petition to incorporate began circulation in Oro Valley in 1968. The Pima County Board of Supervisors officially refused to allow Oro Valley to incorporate, and litigation followed. Ultimately, the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of incorporation, and in 1974 the Town of Oro Valley was incorporated with only {{convert|2.4|sqmi|km2}}. The original town limits included the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts, Campo Bello Estates, Shadow Mountain Estates, and Oro Valley Country Club Estates. Activity in Oro Valley centered primarily around the Oro Valley Country Club and [[Canyon del Oro High School]]. While originally referred to as ''Palo Verde'', town founders proceeded with incorporation efforts with the official name of ''Oro Valley'' to garner support from influential residents of Oro Valley Country Club. The Town began with a population of nearly 1,200.\n\nThrough the 1980s and particularly in the 1990s Oro Valley experienced significant residential and commercial growth. In 1990 the town had a population of 6,670, and by 2000 that figure had increased to 29,700 residents. During that time, residential communities of all housing-unit densities were developed in the town, including several [[master-planned community|master-planned communities]]. For several years in the 1990s Oro Valley was the fastest growing municipality in Arizona.\n\n===Current state of the town===\nFormed by citizens of Oro Valley, the not-for-profit Oro Valley Historical Society has a mission in \"preserving the Town's heritage for future generations.\"\n\n==Geography==\n{{More citations needed section|date= October 2017}}\n[[File:Oro Valley Calle Concordia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Mountains rise in the background of a photo from a residential area in Oro Valley.|View towards Pusch Ridge from Calle Concordia.]]\n\nOro Valley is located at {{coord|32|25|N|110|59|W|type:city}} (32.4212, \u2212110.9760) in the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Oro Valley sits at an average elevation of {{convert|2620|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]] (2000), the town has a total area of {{convert|31.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|31.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.31%) is water.\n\nThe [[topography]] of Oro Valley is distinguished by the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro riverbed bisecting the town.

However, there are small differences. Oro Valley sees slightly less rain throughout the year due to being west of the Santa Catalina Mountains and most of Tucson being south or southwest. The general temperature of Oro Valley is slightly cooler than Tucson year round due to the higher elevation.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town is 41,011, an increase from 29,700 in [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. Dubbed the \"Upscale Tech Mecca\" of Southern Arizona by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' newspaper, Oro Valley is home to over 10 [[high tech]] firms and has a [[median household income]] nearly 50% higher than the [[Household income in the United States|U.S. median]]. The town is located approximately {{convert|110|mi|km}} southeast of the state capital of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nOro Valley is situated in the western foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] at the base of [[Pusch Ridge]]. The [[Tortolita Mountains]] are located north of the town, and vistas of the Tucson valley are to the south. The town occupies the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.  Oro Valley hosts a large number of residents from around the US who maintain second or winter homes in the town.\n\nThe town hosted the 2006 [[Pac-10]] Women's Golf Championships at the [[Oro Valley Country Club]]. Oro Valley Country Club was also the site for the 2006 Girl's Junior America's Cup, a major [[amateur]] [[golf tournament]] for the [[Western United States]]  Annual events in Oro Valley include the Oro Valley Festival of the Arts, El Tour de Tucson [[bicycle race]], the Tucson Marathon, the Cactus Speed Classic for [[inline skating|inline skaters]], and the Arizona Distance Classic.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Pre-U.S. annexation period===\nThe area of Oro Valley has been inhabited discontinuously for nearly two thousand years by various groups of people. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Hohokam]] tribe lived in the Honeybee Village in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains on Oro Valley's far north side around 450 A.D. Hohokam artifacts continue to be discovered in the Honeybee Village that the Hohokam inhabited continuously for nearly 800 years, and studied by archaeologists around the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orovalleyaz.gov/parksandrec/historic-preservation-cultural-resources/native-american-culture-and-history/honey-bee|title=Honey Bee Vilage|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2019|website=Honey Bee Village {{!}} Oro Valley|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 16th century, Native American tribes known as the [[Apache]] arrived in the southern Arizona area, including Oro Valley. These tribes inhabited the region only a few decades prior to the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], including [[Francisco Coronado]]. The Spanish established [[forts]] in the area, including the Presidio at Tucson (1775) beginning in the late 16th century.\n\n===Arizona Territorial period===\nBeginning in the 19th century, Americans increasingly settled in the [[Arizona Territory]], following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the subsequent [[Gadsden Purchase]] including Southern Arizona. Following the Civil War and several Army efforts to pacify the Apaches, Tucson settlers ventured north to settle Oro Valley. Francisco Romero, from a Hispanic family tracing its Tucson roots to the early nineteenth century, established a ranch in what is Catalina State Park today by 1869.  He constructed ranch buildings on the foundations of the Hohokam ruins in the park. Romero lived there intermittently from 1869 to his death in 1905. Members of the Romero family occupied land in that same area until 1930. <Francisco Romero Biofile, Arizona Historical Society><Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGeorge Pusch, a [[German people|German]] immigrant, occupied land in the area of Oro Valley after 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the [[Ca\u00f1ada del Oro]]. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. Pusch and his family never lived on the ranch.  They visited frequently and employed caretakers to manage the property. George Pusch, and later the Pusch Land and Cattle Company, owned Steam Pump Ranch until 1925. Pusch's ranch provided respite for settlers and travelers entering and leaving the Tucson area. Pusch Ridge is named in honor of George Pusch.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n[[Ranching]]  continued to flourish in the area as greater numbers of Americans settled in the Arizona Territory and the state of Arizona. Federal homesteads became available after 1903 when surveys of land were completed. Homesteads were claimed by individuals from 1903 until the 1940s. Hispanic homesteaders included Francisco Romero, Jesus Elias, Francisco Marin, Francisco Aragon and others. Female homesteaders included Ina Gittings, Mabel Burke Johnson, Margaret Moodie and others.  Other prominent homesteaders included William Sutherland, James Reidy and David Morgan. <www.glorecords.gov>\n\nLarge ranching families came to the Oro Valley area in the period 1930-1960. Many of these were wealthy individuals from the Midwest and the East.  They vacationed in Tucson during the period and became interested in living in the desert. They purchased many of the homesteads occupied by original settlers who sold out after 1930.  These wealthy ranchers obtained properties of 1000 to 7000 acres.  They usually lived on the ranches in the winter months and employed caretakers to manage the property and cattle.  These wealthy ranchers included Walter McDonald, John Procter, Lawrence Rooney, Joseph McAdams and Lloyd and Betty Golder.<Williams,James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\nGold rushers into the [[American West]] also were attracted to [[southern Arizona]], where gold was said to be in abundance in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. Fueled by the legend of the lost Iron Door Gold Mine in the mountains, those in search of gold trekked through the Oro Valley area focusing their attention along the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro washbed.  No significant amounts of gold were found locally.\n\n===Post-World War II period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the Tucson area experienced dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. Property owners began subdividing local real estate for development in the early 1930s.  Construction of Campo Bello, the first suburban development, began in 1948. Lots in the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts were sold from the late 1930s to the 1960s and occupied by residents.  In the early 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club opened at the base of Pusch Ridge, affirming the area's future as an affluent community. The Suffolk Hills development was constructed in the period 1960-1962. Although one [[tract housing]] development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.<Williams, James. Claiming the Desert, 2018.>\n\n===Founding of the town===\nThe community continued to grow gradually, and area residents increasingly desired local control of the land in the area. In the late 1960s, incorporation became a greater focus in Oro Valley.  Tucson Mayor James M. Corbett, Jr. expressed great interest in expanding the Tucson city limits to the far north side of [[Pima County]]. Corbett vowed to bring the Oro Valley area into Tucson \"kicking and screaming,\" alluding to the reservations Oro Valley residents expressed in joining Tucson.\n\nA petition to incorporate began circulation in Oro Valley in 1968. The Pima County Board of Supervisors officially refused to allow Oro Valley to incorporate, and litigation followed. Ultimately, the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of incorporation, and in 1974 the Town of Oro Valley was incorporated with only {{convert|2.4|sqmi|km2}}. The original town limits included the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts, Campo Bello Estates, Shadow Mountain Estates, and Oro Valley Country Club Estates. Activity in Oro Valley centered primarily around the Oro Valley Country Club and [[Canyon del Oro High School]]. While originally referred to as ''Palo Verde'', town founders proceeded with incorporation efforts with the official name of ''Oro Valley'' to garner support from influential residents of Oro Valley Country Club. The Town began with a population of nearly 1,200.\n\nThrough the 1980s and particularly in the 1990s Oro Valley experienced significant residential and commercial growth. In 1990 the town had a population of 6,670, and by 2000 that figure had increased to 29,700 residents. During that time, residential communities of all housing-unit densities were developed in the town, including several [[master-planned community|master-planned communities]]. For several years in the 1990s Oro Valley was the fastest growing municipality in Arizona.\n\n===Current state of the town===\nFormed by citizens of Oro Valley, the not-for-profit Oro Valley Historical Society has a mission in \"preserving the Town's heritage for future generations.\"\n\n==Geography==\n{{More citations needed section|date= October 2017}}\n[[File:Oro Valley Calle Concordia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Mountains rise in the background of a photo from a residential area in Oro Valley.|View towards Pusch Ridge from Calle Concordia.]]\n\nOro Valley is located at {{coord|32|25|N|110|59|W|type:city}} (32.4212, \u2212110.9760) in the middle Ca\u00f1ada del Oro Valley.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Oro Valley sits at an average elevation of {{convert|2620|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]] (2000), the town has a total area of {{convert|31.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|31.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.31%) is water.\n\nThe [[topography]] of Oro Valley is distinguished by the Ca\u00f1ada del Oro riverbed bisecting the town.

In 1979 Beam met and married his wife, Ann Beam. \"In developing his work over the years, Beam has been accompanied by his wife, Ann, herself an artist and a former teacher at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Often they have worked as collaborators\".<ref>Joan Murray, The Whale of Our Being Catalogue, 2002, p.4</ref> At this time he incorporated multiple photographic images onto a single picture plane. \"He disregarded the illusory deep space of Renaissance depiction, in favour of a flat tableau, where a dialogue of multiple images could take place\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At this time his photographic imagery was achieved primarily via screen process, photo-etching, [[Instant film|Polaroid]] instant prints, and a solvent transfer technique also used by [[Robert Rauschenberg]].\n\n==Living in the Southwestern United States==\nIn 1980, Beam and his wife, Ann, and daughter, Anong, moved to Arroyo Seco, [[New Mexico]] to live and work. \"We developed a dialogue together in everyday living, politics, world events, ceramic technique, painting, and all things art, that would continue for the next 26 years\".<ref>Ann Beam, in conversation with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008</ref>  Said Beam of the time \"It was in the southwest years later with Ann and Anong, who was a baby, that I saw my first [[Mimbres pottery|Mimbres]] bowl, or rather a cupboard full of Mimbres bowls in a gallery on the square in downtown [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico. Some were completely intact, some had been restored, but all shared a bold adventurous design. When I discovered they were done 1,000 years ago, I was completely surprised.\"<ref>Carl Beam, It's All Relative Catalogue, 2005, p.8</ref> Beam and his wife Ann exhibited their ceramic work together in ''The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam'' at the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], [[University of New Mexico]], Albuquerque, NM.\n\n==Ceramic works and pottery==\nBeam minored in ceramic pottery at the Kootenay School of Art.  Despite having received top notch training, he found he lacked the ability to express himself as compared to with canvas or paper.  Beam abandoned pottery as an art form but only temporarily.  Years later in 1980 while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Beam again became interested in handmade pottery via his exposure to [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara]] pottery and [[Mimbres pottery|Mimbres]] bowls as were made by the Anasazi who lived in the area centuries before.\n\nIn the words of Ann Beam, \"It was the Santa Clara blackwares that got us first\" <ref name=\"Exhibition Catalogue 2003\">\"It's All Relative\", Exhibition Catalogue, Virginia Eichorn, October 2003.</ref>  Beam became excited with the adventurous and bold designs he observed in these works.  Eventually he met Rose Montaya who further exposed him to her techniques and those passed down from her mother.  Having learned much from Rose, Beam was able to find his own clay and paint stones, fire outside with dried dung or wood, and experiment extensively \u2013 about 70% of the early works were lost due to trial and error \u2013 all works were handmade without a wheel, often unglazed and polished with a stone.\n\n[[File:Carl Beam Handmade Pottery 01.JPG|240px|left|thumb|Figure 1 - Inside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam]]\n[[File:Carl Beam Handmade Pottery 02.JPG|240px|right|thumb|Figure 2 - Outside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam]]\n\nHis Mimbres bowls were fabricated as a modern version of the ancient [[Anasazi]] ones - on the interior they were generally cream colored and quite smooth whereas the exterior appeared almost disregarded and less important (see Figures 1 and 2).

It continues to tour.\n\n==Legacy==\nCarl Beam was the first artist of Native ancestry to have his work purchased by the National Gallery of Canada as contemporary art (1986), thus opening the door for a generation of Native artists to enter. \"Despite Beam's reluctance to be defined as a \"Native Artist\", his art deals with the struggles of his people.\"<ref>Dierdre Hanna, NOW magazine, Vol.9, #26, 1990</ref> Beam brought an innovative approach to all the media he worked in. \"Technically Beam is regarded as an innovator for his intentional blurring of diverse art practises, thereby enabling certain methodologies and techniques to acquire new contexts. His innovative techniques, in fact, have been emulated by a new generation of artists-Native and not.\"<ref>Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p.5</ref> \"He evolved his own unique techniques as needed in photo-etching and photo based painting, to name a few, and his passionate discourse on all things political and practical inspired many people.\"<ref>Ann Beam in discussion with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008</ref>  A major retrospective of his work, mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, is on exhibition, having started October 22, 2010, thus recognizing Beam as one of Canada's most important artists.

He went on to earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the [[University of Victoria]] in 1974, and entered into post-graduate studies at the [[University of Alberta]], (1975\u201376).

In 1979 Beam met and married his wife, Ann Beam. \"In developing his work over the years, Beam has been accompanied by his wife, Ann, herself an artist and a former teacher at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Often they have worked as collaborators\".<ref>Joan Murray, The Whale of Our Being Catalogue, 2002, p.4</ref> At this time he incorporated multiple photographic images onto a single picture plane. \"He disregarded the illusory deep space of Renaissance depiction, in favour of a flat tableau, where a dialogue of multiple images could take place\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At this time his photographic imagery was achieved primarily via screen process, photo-etching, [[Instant film|Polaroid]] instant prints, and a solvent transfer technique also used by [[Robert Rauschenberg]].\n\n==Living in the Southwestern United States==\nIn 1980, Beam and his wife, Ann, and daughter, Anong, moved to Arroyo Seco, [[New Mexico]] to live and work. \"We developed a dialogue together in everyday living, politics, world events, ceramic technique, painting, and all things art, that would continue for the next 26 years\".<ref>Ann Beam, in conversation with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008</ref>  Said Beam of the time \"It was in the southwest years later with Ann and Anong, who was a baby, that I saw my first [[Mimbres pottery|Mimbres]] bowl, or rather a cupboard full of Mimbres bowls in a gallery on the square in downtown [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico. Some were completely intact, some had been restored, but all shared a bold adventurous design. When I discovered they were done 1,000 years ago, I was completely surprised.\"<ref>Carl Beam, It's All Relative Catalogue, 2005, p.8</ref> Beam and his wife Ann exhibited their ceramic work together in ''The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam'' at the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], [[University of New Mexico]], Albuquerque, NM.\n\n==Ceramic works and pottery==\nBeam minored in ceramic pottery at the Kootenay School of Art.  Despite having received top notch training, he found he lacked the ability to express himself as compared to with canvas or paper.  Beam abandoned pottery as an art form but only temporarily.  Years later in 1980 while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Beam again became interested in handmade pottery via his exposure to [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara]] pottery and [[Mimbres pottery|Mimbres]] bowls as were made by the Anasazi who lived in the area centuries before.\n\nIn the words of Ann Beam, \"It was the Santa Clara blackwares that got us first\" <ref name=\"Exhibition Catalogue 2003\">\"It's All Relative\", Exhibition Catalogue, Virginia Eichorn, October 2003.</ref>  Beam became excited with the adventurous and bold designs he observed in these works.  Eventually he met Rose Montaya who further exposed him to her techniques and those passed down from her mother.  Having learned much from Rose, Beam was able to find his own clay and paint stones, fire outside with dried dung or wood, and experiment extensively \u2013 about 70% of the early works were lost due to trial and error \u2013 all works were handmade without a wheel, often unglazed and polished with a stone.\n\n[[File:Carl Beam Handmade Pottery 01.JPG|240px|left|thumb|Figure 1 - Inside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam]]\n[[File:Carl Beam Handmade Pottery 02.JPG|240px|right|thumb|Figure 2 - Outside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam]]\n\nHis Mimbres bowls were fabricated as a modern version of the ancient [[Anasazi]] ones - on the interior they were generally cream colored and quite smooth whereas the exterior appeared almost disregarded and less important (see Figures 1 and 2).  Having studied all available exemplars found in museums, art galleries, shops, books, and otherwise, Beam's contemporary versions were largely influenced by the materials and sophisticated art dialogue present in the Anasazi works he saw.   Also in the Anasazi tradition, Beam's bowls typically featured a bold design around the rim with his own unique images placed in the center.  The result of his and Ann's early work was an exhibition in 1982 entitled \"The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam\" at the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]] of the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]],<ref>Joan Murray, The What of Our Being catalog, 2002</ref>  with other shows to follow later.\n\nBeam preferred the [[Mimbres pottery|Mimbres]] bowl because it was a form conducive to his creative expression: \"Finally, one form I could use to be absolutely creative in \u2026 the hemispherical quality of a large bowl still excites me like no cup, tea pot, plate or other clay shape can do\u2026it is a universe unto itself where anything can happen \u2013 the designs are limitless.\" <ref name=\"Exhibition Catalogue 2003\"/>\n\nBeam continued to work on and off in pottery, creating bowls, snake pots and other handmade creations almost always decorated with his designs and images.

Kennedy]],  [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], Italian Christian iconography, diverse animal species, self-portraits and technology (stop lights, rockets). There were two sculptural elements, ''Voyage'' a partial reconstruction of the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Maria]], and the ''Ampulleta'', a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} hourglass, with one obstructive stone within the sand, as well as several installations, and a video performance of Beam in the [[Dominican Republic]], making a representational graveyard on the beaches where the landing could have taken place.\n\nIn 1992 Carl Beam and Ann Beam built an [[adobe]] house on [[Manitoulin Island]]. \"Their adobe house became to a certain extent, a large-scale project which evolved naturally out of their earlier experiences with Native American pottery and the building vernacular of the American southwest.\"<ref>Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p.6</ref> <ref name=\":1\" />Their life experience was incorporated in his exhibition ''Living in Mother Earth'', and her exhibition ''Sub-division Suite/Earth Builder's Narrative''.\n\n==The Whale of Our Being==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Whale of Our Being.jpg|thumb|Example of \"The Whale of Our Being\" series work by [[Carl Beam]] circa 2002]] -->\n\nBeam entered the new millennium with the body of work entitled ''The Whale of Our Being'', in this work \"Beam examines the calamitous moral fallout from what he perceives as a profound spiritual absence in contemporary society, symbolized by a great whale of primordial proportions\".<ref>Allan J. Ryan, 2005 Governor General's Awards for Excellence in Visual and Media Arts Catalog, p.18,21,</ref> Featuring large [[photo emulsion]] works on canvas, constructions, large-scale paper works, and ceramics. \"Compared to earlier work, ''The Whale of Our Being'' exhibits a positively [[baroque]] complexity, a dizzying assortment of references, sometimes printed in overly saturated, fluorescent colour. ''Mystery'', for instance, is pink-Day-Glo-coloured pink. The colour in ''Summa'' ranges from Day-Glo yellow-green to orange; the images from Einstein and the Hubble Telescope, and astronaut, and Sitting Bull to and image of the First Nations, and more besides.\"<ref>Joan Murray, The Whale of Our Being catalogue, 2002, p.3</ref> His imagery had become vast and all inclusive, in ''The Whale of Our Being'' \"He re-examines the media construction of violence and infamy and the public fascination with celebrity\".<ref>Allan J. Ryan, 2005 Governor General's Awards for Excellence in Visual and Media Arts Catalog, p.21</ref> Said Beam at a panel discussion for the Beyond History exhibition in 1989, \"If an artist has a legitimate premise, there is nothing which isn't within their field of enquiry\".<ref>Carl Beam, panel discussion, Beyond History exhibition, Vancouver, 1989</ref>\n\n==Crossroads==\nHis last body of work was in process until the time of his death in 2005. It was titled ''Crossroads'' from the blues song by [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. The work included images of pop stars, gangsters, scientists, native leaders, politicians, writers and poets, musicians ([[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Britney Spears]], [[John Lennon]]), TV personalities ([[Martha Stewart]]), animals, and birds. He had completed [[Plexiglas]] works, and 22\"x 30\" paper works for ''Crossroads'' and was in the middle of a suite of etchings at the time of his death.\n\n==''It's All Relative'' exhibition==\nIn 2004, the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery in Waterloo, Ontario, created a traveling exhibition, curated by Virginia Eichhorn, of 50 ceramic pieces by Carl Beam, Ann Beam, and Anong Migwans Beam. This marked the first time all three exhibited together. It was his last exhibition during his lifetime. It continues to tour.\n\n==Legacy==\nCarl Beam was the first artist of Native ancestry to have his work purchased by the National Gallery of Canada as contemporary art (1986), thus opening the door for a generation of Native artists to enter. \"Despite Beam's reluctance to be defined as a \"Native Artist\", his art deals with the struggles of his people.\"<ref>Dierdre Hanna, NOW magazine, Vol.9, #26, 1990</ref> Beam brought an innovative approach to all the media he worked in. \"Technically Beam is regarded as an innovator for his intentional blurring of diverse art practises, thereby enabling certain methodologies and techniques to acquire new contexts. His innovative techniques, in fact, have been emulated by a new generation of artists-Native and not.\"<ref>Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p.5</ref> \"He evolved his own unique techniques as needed in photo-etching and photo based painting, to name a few, and his passionate discourse on all things political and practical inspired many people.\"<ref>Ann Beam in discussion with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008</ref>  A major retrospective of his work, mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, is on exhibition, having started October 22, 2010, thus recognizing Beam as one of Canada's most important artists. The exhibition is curated by Greg A. Hill, Audain Curator and Head of the Department of Indigenous Art, and is accompanied by a catalogue with essays by Ann Beam, Greg Hill, Gerald McMaster, Virginia Eichhorn, and Alan Corbiere with Crystal Migwans, including paintings, photo-based collage works, constructions, ceramics and  videos.<ref>Newsletter: On TOUR\nNational Gallery of Canada and Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography Travelling Exhibitions Newsletter No. 16 - June 2008</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n\n* In 2000 Beam was inducted into the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]<ref name=RCA1880>{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=11 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=26 May 2011 }}</ref>\n*Beam received the [[Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts|Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts]] in 2005.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carlbeam.com The official site for the estate of Carl Beam]\n* [http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20061111161348/http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=354 Cybermuse artist page]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beam, Carl}}\n[[Category:Ojibwe people]]\n[[Category:First Nations painters]]\n[[Category:First Nations potters]]\n[[Category:Canadian ceramists]]\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian painters]]\n[[Category:Canadian male painters]]\n[[Category:Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts winners]]\n[[Category:20th-century ceramists]]\n", "name_user": "Danielkernohan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Beam"}
