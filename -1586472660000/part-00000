{"title_page": "Effective dimension", "text_new": "{{One source|text=The article relies on sources from one research group.|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''effective dimension''' is a modification of [[Hausdorff dimension]] and other [[fractal dimension]]s which places it in a [[computability theory]] setting. There are several horse Wang's  variations (various notions of effective dimension) of which the most common is '''effective Hausdorff dimension'''. [[Dimension]], in mathematics, is a particular way of describing the size of an object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff dimension generalizes the well-known integer dimensions assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension|fractal]] subsets of the plane may have intermediate dimension between 1 and 2, as they are \"larger\" than lines or curves, and yet \"smaller\" than filled circles or rectangles. Effective dimension modifies Hausdorff dimension by requiring that objects with small effective dimension be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff dimension also have large effective dimension, and objects with small effective dimension have small Hausdorff dimension, but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective dimension. An example is an [[algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]] point on a line, which has Hausdorff dimension 0 (since it is a point) but effective dimension 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff dimension 1).\n\n== Rigorous definitions ==\nThis article will define effective dimension for subsets of [[Cantor space]] '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup>; closely related definitions exist for subsets of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. We will move freely between considering a set ''X'' of natural numbers, the infinite sequence <math>\\chi_X</math> given by the characteristic function of ''X'', and the real number with binary expansion 0.''X''.\n\n=== Martingales and other gales ===\n<!-- This isn't properly part of the article on effective dimension, but is necessary background information. It could, potentially be moved to a different article (perhaps on algorithmic randomness? That whole area of Wikipedia seems somewhat disorganized and I didn't want to redo it.) -->\n\nA ''[[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]]'' on Cantor space '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup> is a function ''d'': '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u2265&nbsp;0</sup> from Cantor space to nonnegative reals which satisfies the fairness condition:\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma)=\\frac12 (d(\\sigma 0)+d(\\sigma 1))</math>\n\nA martingale is thought of as a betting strategy, and the function <math>d(\\sigma)</math> gives the capital of the better after seeing a sequence \u03c3 of 0s and 1s. The fairness condition then says that the capital after a sequence \u03c3 is the average of the capital after seeing \u03c30 and \u03c31; in other words the martingale gives a betting scheme for a bookie with 2:1 odds offered on either of two \"equally likely\" options, hence the name fair.\n\n(Note that this is subtly different from the probability theory notion of [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]].<ref name=wccrsm>{{cite journal |author1=John M. Hitchcock |author2=Jack H. Lutz | title = Why computational complexity requires stricter martingales | journal = Theory of Computing Systems | year = 2006}}</ref> That definition of martingale has a similar fairness condition, which also states that the expected value after some observation is the same as the value before the observation, given the prior history of observations. The difference is that in probability theory, the prior history of observations just refers to the capital history, whereas here the history refers to the exact sequence of 0s and 1s in the string.)\n\nA ''supermartingale'' on Cantor space is a function ''d'' as above which satisfies a modified fairness condition:\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) \\geq \\frac12 (d(\\sigma 0)+d(\\sigma 1))</math>\n\nA supermartingale is a betting strategy where the expected capital after a bet is no more than the capital before a bet, in contrast to a martingale where the two are always equal. This allows more flexibility, and is very similar in the non-effective case, since whenever a supermartingale ''d'' is given, there is a modified function ''d''' which wins at least as much money as ''d'' and which is actually a martingale. However it is useful to allow the additional flexibility once one starts talking about actually giving algorithms to determine the betting strategy, as some algorithms lend themselves more naturally to producing supermartingales than martingales.\n\nAn ''s''-''gale'' is a function ''d'' as above of the form\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) = \\frac{e(\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)|\\sigma|}}</math>\n\nfor ''e'' some martingale.\n\nAn ''s''-''supergale'' is a function ''d'' as above of the form\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) = \\frac{e(\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)|\\sigma|}}</math>\n\nfor ''e'' some supermartingale.\n\nAn ''s''-(super)gale is a betting strategy where some amount of capital is lost to inflation at each step.  Note that ''s''-gales and ''s''-supergales are examples of supermartingales, and the 1-gales and 1-supergales are precisely the martingales and supermartingales.\n\nCollectively, these objects are known as \"gales\".\n\nA gale ''d'' ''succeeds'' on a subset ''X'' of the natural numbers if <math>\\limsup_n d(X|n)=\\infty</math> where <math>X|n</math> denotes the ''n''-digit string consisting of the first ''n'' digits of ''X''.\n\nA gale ''d'' ''succeeds strongly'' on ''X'' if <math>\\liminf_n d(X|n)=\\infty</math>.\n\nAll of these notions of various gales have no effective content, but one must necessarily restrict oneself to a small class of gales, since some gale can be found which succeeds on any given set. After all, if one knows a sequence of coin flips in advance, it is easy to make money by simply betting on the known outcomes of each flip. A standard way of doing this is to require the gales to be either computable or close to computable:\n\nA gale ''d'' is called ''constructive'', ''c.e.'', or ''lower semi-computable'' if the numbers <math>d(\\sigma)</math> are uniformly left-c.e. reals (i.e. can uniformly be written as the limit of an increasing computable sequence of rationals).\n\nThe '''effective Hausdorff dimension''' of a set of natural numbers ''X'' is <math>\\inf \\{s : \\mathrm{some\\ c.e.}\\ s\\mathrm{-gale\\ succeeds\\ on\\ } X \\}</math>.<ref name=dicc>{{cite journal | author = Jack H.

For example, [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension|fractal]] subsets of the plane may have intermediate dimension between 1 and 2, as they are \"larger\" than lines or curves, and yet \"smaller\" than filled circles or rectangles. Effective dimension modifies Hausdorff dimension by requiring that objects with small effective dimension be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff dimension also have large effective dimension, and objects with small effective dimension have small Hausdorff dimension, but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective dimension. An example is an [[algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]] point on a line, which has Hausdorff dimension 0 (since it is a point) but effective dimension 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff dimension 1).\n\n== Rigorous definitions ==\nThis article will define effective dimension for subsets of [[Cantor space]] '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup>; closely related definitions exist for subsets of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. We will move freely between considering a set ''X'' of natural numbers, the infinite sequence <math>\\chi_X</math> given by the characteristic function of ''X'', and the real number with binary expansion 0.''X''.\n\n=== Martingales and other gales ===\n<!-- This isn't properly part of the article on effective dimension, but is necessary background information. It could, potentially be moved to a different article (perhaps on algorithmic randomness? That whole area of Wikipedia seems somewhat disorganized and I didn't want to redo it.) -->\n\nA ''[[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]]'' on Cantor space '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup> is a function ''d'': '''2'''<sup>\u03c9</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u2265&nbsp;0</sup> from Cantor space to nonnegative reals which satisfies the fairness condition:\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma)=\\frac12 (d(\\sigma 0)+d(\\sigma 1))</math>\n\nA martingale is thought of as a betting strategy, and the function <math>d(\\sigma)</math> gives the capital of the better after seeing a sequence \u03c3 of 0s and 1s. The fairness condition then says that the capital after a sequence \u03c3 is the average of the capital after seeing \u03c30 and \u03c31; in other words the martingale gives a betting scheme for a bookie with 2:1 odds offered on either of two \"equally likely\" options, hence the name fair.\n\n(Note that this is subtly different from the probability theory notion of [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]].<ref name=wccrsm>{{cite journal |author1=John M. Hitchcock |author2=Jack H. Lutz | title = Why computational complexity requires stricter martingales | journal = Theory of Computing Systems | year = 2006}}</ref> That definition of martingale has a similar fairness condition, which also states that the expected value after some observation is the same as the value before the observation, given the prior history of observations. The difference is that in probability theory, the prior history of observations just refers to the capital history, whereas here the history refers to the exact sequence of 0s and 1s in the string.)\n\nA ''supermartingale'' on Cantor space is a function ''d'' as above which satisfies a modified fairness condition:\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) \\geq \\frac12 (d(\\sigma 0)+d(\\sigma 1))</math>\n\nA supermartingale is a betting strategy where the expected capital after a bet is no more than the capital before a bet, in contrast to a martingale where the two are always equal. This allows more flexibility, and is very similar in the non-effective case, since whenever a supermartingale ''d'' is given, there is a modified function ''d''' which wins at least as much money as ''d'' and which is actually a martingale. However it is useful to allow the additional flexibility once one starts talking about actually giving algorithms to determine the betting strategy, as some algorithms lend themselves more naturally to producing supermartingales than martingales.\n\nAn ''s''-''gale'' is a function ''d'' as above of the form\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) = \\frac{e(\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)|\\sigma|}}</math>\n\nfor ''e'' some martingale.\n\nAn ''s''-''supergale'' is a function ''d'' as above of the form\n\n: <math>d(\\sigma) = \\frac{e(\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)|\\sigma|}}</math>\n\nfor ''e'' some supermartingale.\n\nAn ''s''-(super)gale is a betting strategy where some amount of capital is lost to inflation at each step.  Note that ''s''-gales and ''s''-supergales are examples of supermartingales, and the 1-gales and 1-supergales are precisely the martingales and supermartingales.\n\nCollectively, these objects are known as \"gales\".\n\nA gale ''d'' ''succeeds'' on a subset ''X'' of the natural numbers if <math>\\limsup_n d(X|n)=\\infty</math> where <math>X|n</math> denotes the ''n''-digit string consisting of the first ''n'' digits of ''X''.\n\nA gale ''d'' ''succeeds strongly'' on ''X'' if <math>\\liminf_n d(X|n)=\\infty</math>.\n\nAll of these notions of various gales have no effective content, but one must necessarily restrict oneself to a small class of gales, since some gale can be found which succeeds on any given set. After all, if one knows a sequence of coin flips in advance, it is easy to make money by simply betting on the known outcomes of each flip. A standard way of doing this is to require the gales to be either computable or close to computable:\n\nA gale ''d'' is called ''constructive'', ''c.e.'', or ''lower semi-computable'' if the numbers <math>d(\\sigma)</math> are uniformly left-c.e. reals (i.e. can uniformly be written as the limit of an increasing computable sequence of rationals).\n\nThe '''effective Hausdorff dimension''' of a set of natural numbers ''X'' is <math>\\inf \\{s : \\mathrm{some\\ c.e.}\\ s\\mathrm{-gale\\ succeeds\\ on\\ } X \\}</math>.<ref name=dicc>{{cite journal | author = Jack H.

The appointment was created as a career reserved position in the Justice department, meaning it came under the authority of the attorney general who could only remove the special prosecutor \"for cause\", e.g., gross improprieties or malfeasance in office.

The book provoked considerable discussion at time of publication.\n\n== Content ==\nZinn presents his book as a questioning of what he sees as major myths in the understanding of Southern history, Southern culture, and possibilities for the future of race relations. Zinn begins his books by highlighting the continuing cruelty of Southern racism, especially in the continuation of the concept of biological differences between races. To demonstrate the possibility of massive future changes, Zinn puts aside historical tools of analysis in favor of the then-popular '[[Situationism_(psychology)|situational psychology]]' framework. This set of ideas emphasizes the mutability of human behavior, especially in comparison to the ideas of unconscious reaction supported by [[Freudian psychology]].<ref name=\"LOTL2012\"/>\n\nIn the case of the South, Zinn uses this framework to argue against an intrinsic, unassailable divide between black and white Southerners. Further, Zinn questions the idea that the racism in the North and South were unbridgably different, arguing instead that the difference was in degree, rather than kind--the North was simply a little less racist. Finally, Zinn disposes of the question of whether differences between races were environmentally, biologically, or culturally produced. Takes all these positions, Zinn argues that the antidote to racism is \"massive contact\" between the black and white populations, far beyond anything that had occurred in the North.<ref name=\"LOTL2012\">{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |date=2012 |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=63-69}}</ref>\n\n''The Southern Mystique'' was in large part a rearrangement of Zinn's previous writings, with only fifty of the books 270 pages being entirely new.<ref name=\"LOTL2012\">{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |date=2012 |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=63-69}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Martin Duberman]] describes how Zinn's book was received following publication in his biography ''[[Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left]]''. Duberman notes that overall coverage was positive, with reviews by lower-tier figures in shorter reviews presenting favourable commentary. He highlights, however, three national intellectuals who lobbed long, critical reviews at the book: [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], [[C. Vann Woodward]], and [[Ralph Ellison]]. \n\nSmith was the most dismissive of the three, characterizing Smith's handling of the complexities of Southern life as \"shallow,\" his argumentation lacking \"a variety of facts\" to argue his major claims, and his minimization of the past's significance as \"greatly mistaken.\" A significant failure, Smith argued, was Zinn's argument that Northern and Southern racism was the same.\n\nThough Woodward granted that he had never encountered \"so genial and disarming a critic\" as Zinn, Woodward extended Smith's central critiques with added intricacies. Like Smith, Woodward criticized how Zinn failed to describe any of the South's special historical experiences compared to the North, including slavery, [[American Civil War|secession]], and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. Again like Smith, Woodward questioned Zinn's minimization view of historians' \"overly heavy sense of history.\" Further, Woodward questioned Zinn's dismissal of [[Freudian psychology]]. Though Woodward agreed that South's culture had the capacity for change and indeed ''had'' changed over the last decades, he argued that there was little evidence that Zinn's idea of massive integration could succeed.\n\nEllison said that \"One needn't agree with Zinn, but one cannot afford not to hear him out... we must read him with the finest of our attention.\" And indeed Ellison did not agree with Zinn.

The book provoked considerable discussion at time of publication.\n\n== Content ==\nZinn presents his book as a questioning of what he sees as major myths in the understanding of Southern history, Southern culture, and possibilities for the future of race relations. Zinn begins his books by highlighting the continuing cruelty of Southern racism, especially in the continuation of the concept of biological differences between races. To demonstrate the possibility of massive future changes, Zinn puts aside historical tools of analysis in favor of the then-popular '[[Situationism_(psychology)|situational psychology]]' framework. This set of ideas emphasizes the mutability of human behavior, especially in comparison to the ideas of unconscious reaction supported by [[Freudian psychology]].\n\nIn the case of the South, Zinn uses this framework to argue against an intrinsic, unassailable divide between black and white Southerners. Further, Zinn questions the idea that the racism in the North and South were unbridgably different, arguing instead that the difference was in degree, rather than kind--the North was simply a little less racist. Finally, Zinn disposes of the question of whether differences between races were environmentally, biologically, or culturally produced. Takes all these positions, Zinn argues that the antidote to racism is \"massive contact\" between the black and white populations, far beyond anything that had occurred in the North.<ref name=\"LOTL2012\">{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |date=2012 |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=63-69}}</ref>\n\n''The Southern Mystique'' was in large part a rearrangement of Zinn's previous writings, with only fifty of the books 270 pages being entirely new.<ref name=\"LOTL2012\">{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |date=2012 |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=63-69}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Martin Duberman]] describes how Zinn's book was received following publication in his biography ''[[Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left]]''. Duberman notes that overall coverage was positive, with reviews by lower-tier figures in shorter reviews presenting favourable commentary. He highlights, however, three national intellectuals who lobbed long, critical reviews at the book: [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], [[C. Vann Woodward]], and [[Ralph Ellison]]. \n\nSmith was the most dismissive of the three, characterizing Smith's handling of the complexities of Southern life as \"shallow,\" his argumentation lacking \"a variety of facts\" to argue his major claims, and his minimization of the past's significance as \"greatly mistaken.\" A significant failure, Smith argued, was Zinn's argument that Northern and Southern racism was the same.\n\nThough Woodward granted that he had never encountered \"so genial and disarming a critic\" as Zinn, Woodward extended Smith's central critiques with added intricacies. Like Smith, Woodward criticized how Zinn failed to describe any of the South's special historical experiences compared to the North, including slavery, [[American Civil War|secession]], and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. Again like Smith, Woodward questioned Zinn's minimization view of historians' \"overly heavy sense of history.\" Further, Woodward questioned Zinn's dismissal of [[Freudian psychology]]. Though Woodward agreed that South's culture had the capacity for change and indeed ''had'' changed over the last decades, he argued that there was little evidence that Zinn's idea of massive integration could succeed.\n\nEllison said that \"One needn't agree with Zinn, but one cannot afford not to hear him out... we must read him with the finest of our attention.\" And indeed Ellison did not agree with Zinn. In addition to supporting Smith and Woodwards' complaints, though with less severity, Ellison critiqued Zinn's orientation towards \"causation\" and towards racism itself. By ignoring the \"encumbrances of the past,\" Ellison argues that Zinn \"makes too much mystery of what, in its political aspects, is really a struggle for power.\" Regarding Zinn's argument that racism's greatest sin is \"its perpetuation of the mystery of racial differences,\" Ellison highlights that segregation's impact on \"individual and group alike\" appear much more important.<ref name=\"LOTL2012\">{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |date=2012 |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=63-69}}</ref>\n", "name_user": "Jlevi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContent:c", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Southern_Mystique"}

The frequency of incidents involving DGU, and their effectiveness in providing safety and reducing crime is a controversial issue in [[gun politics]] and criminology, chiefly in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"hlw\">[[Harry L.

Perceptions of  defensive gun use are recurring themes in discussions over [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], [[gun control]], [[armed police]], [[Open carry in the United States|open]] and [[concealed carry]] of firearms.\n\n==Estimates of frequency==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = People training [[Gun politics in the Czech Republic|self-defense with firearm in the Czech Republic]]\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Czech self defense training pic01.jpg\n| alt1      = A line of people in front of targets with guns in holsters.\n| image2    = Czech self defense training pic02.jpg\n| alt2      = A line of people in front of targets reaching for their guns in holsters.\n| image3    = Czech self defense training pic03.jpg\n| alt3      = A line of people in front of targets drawing guns from holsters.\n| image4    = Czech self defense training pic04.jpg\n| alt4      = A line of people aiming at targets.\n}}\nEstimates over the number of defensive gun uses very wildly, depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use, survey design, country, population, criteria, time-period studied, and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55,000 to 80,000 incidents per year, while high end estimates reach 4.7 million per year.

However, they questioned whether this estimate was credible because the same survey suggests that approximately 132,000 perpetrators were either wounded or killed at the hands of armed civilians in 1994.

The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small ''subsets'' of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the ''total'' number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.<ref name=\"Kleck, G 2001\">Kleck, G. and D.

In ''More Guns, Less Crime'', Lott writes that \"[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police\".\n\nAttempting to quantify this phenomenon, in the first edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that \"national surveys\" suggested that \"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.\" The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias.

The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small ''subsets'' of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the ''total'' number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.<ref name=\"Kleck, G 2001\">Kleck, G. and D.

In ''More Guns, Less Crime'', Lott writes that \"[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police\".\n\nAttempting to quantify this phenomenon, in the first edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that \"national surveys\" suggested that \"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.\" The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias.

The FANG initiative was to demonstrate a way to procure working systems better than the current defense acquisition process, which frequently leads to delays and cost overruns. The Marines are in charge of the ACV program, so there was no guarantee that the Darpa-crowdsourced mobility drivetrain would result in a vehicle bought by the Corps.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/darpa-fang-winner/ This Is the Million-Dollar Design for Darpa\u2019s Crowdsourced Swimming Tank] - Wired.com, April 22, 2013</ref>\n\nAt a roundtable discussion on 26 June 2013, Marine Corps General [[James F.

The Corps has secured and saved a \u201cmoderate amount\u201d of money for early development. With the previous Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle cancelled from cost overruns, the Marines are being cautious to identify trade-offs between requirements and cost for the platform. Amos noted that they were working with contractors to see which type of vehicle would meet requirements without proving too costly.<ref>[http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_06_26_2013_p0-591775.xml RFP For Marine Corps ACV Expected In 2014] - Aviationweek.com, 26 June 2013</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, the ACV team was created and tasked to evaluate the feasibility of building an affordable, survivable amphibious high water speed vehicle. The team includes representatives from over six Department of Defense commands. Their initial requirements and engineering analysis evaluated 198 requirements for the platform. From July 9\u201311, 2013, 25 Marines gathered at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia]] for a Warfighter Requirements Workshop to review the team's capabilities analysis and determine the value of various capabilities. 30 requirements with cost and weight implications were considered \"tradable,\" including armament and armor protection. Safety and design-specific capabilities, like transportability (fitting on an amphibious ship) were considered non-tradable. The point of the workshop was to get input from fleet Marines about what capabilities they wanted to prioritize with current financial pressures. Over the next month, the team ordered the preferences and applied actual cost and weight data to determine feasibility recommendations for Marine Corps leaders by the fall.<ref>[http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/News/PressReleaseArticleDisplay/tabid/8007/Article/146253/acv-team-seeks-marines-insight-into-vehicle-requirements.aspx ACV team seeks Marines\u2019 insight into vehicle requirements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201021/http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/News/PressReleaseArticleDisplay/tabid/8007/Article/146253/acv-team-seeks-marines-insight-into-vehicle-requirements.aspx |date=October 29, 2013 }} - MarCorSysCom.Marines.mil, 15 July 2013</ref>\n\nThe Marine Corps feels they have only one opportunity to get the ACV program right, partly from the previous EFV program being cancelled in 2011 after using $3 billion in development and also from severely reduced budgets for the rest of the decade compared to the previous one. They may not even know exactly what they want and can afford from the vehicle. Trade studies began in January 2013 and were to be conducted for six months, but they were extended another six months. With the service's normally tight budget combined with sequester cuts, giving priority to the ACV may take funding and resources from other programs. The plan to begin buying 5,500 [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]]s around 2019 could have been replaced with retaining and modernizing up-armored [[Humvee]]s and keeping the large numbers of relatively young [[Oshkosh M-ATV]]s. The Corps' preference for the ACV over the JLTV and willingness to sacrifice it is partly to maintain the ability to make amphibious landings. The amphibious-capable [[Marine Personnel Carrier]] is a program to create a better vehicle to transport Marines after they come ashore. In June 2013, budgetary pressures forced the MPC program to be suspended for up to a decade to focus funding on other priorities.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130920/DEFREG02/309200011/ Marines Tread Carefully in Search for New Amphibious Vehicle] - Defensenews.com, 20 September 2013</ref>\n\nGeneral Amos received an analysis of ACV alternatives in November 2013, so it was unlikely he could make a decision on whether to develop or buy a vehicle in the Marine's FY 2015 budget request, due February 2014. Despite the Marine's ship-to-shore amphibious landing role and the ACV being declared the service's number-one priority, there are factors that put its future in doubt. Options for vehicle capabilities were to create a high-speed platform that meets desired goals which may come out to be too expensive like the previous EFV program, create a low-speed platform with reduced performance for affordability which may not be enough of an improvement over the AAV it is replacing, or delay the effort for more research and development time to refine requirements and wait for budget problems to pass. If creating a new amphibious vehicle were delayed, the Marines would have to rely more on the [[MV-22 Osprey]] and other helicopters in the near-future for moving troops to a breach, which cannot support them on the ground or protect them under armor. A high-speed vehicle may not even be viable for future assault landings, as even though it would be made to deploy further out to sea to give stand-off protection of transport ships from anti-ship missiles, the ACV itself would then be vulnerable to those missiles. Methods of traveling on water are limited to current and slow methods through it or traveling on top, similar to a [[jet ski]], which is expensive. How an amphibious vehicle will perform fighting on land is uncertain. AAVs had mixed success in Iraq and were vulnerable to [[improvised explosive device]]s, which endangers more troops with the higher carrying capacity of amphibious vehicles over regular [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. The [[U.S. Army]] faced the same threats, and their [[Ground Combat Vehicle]] program aimed for the greatest protection without excessive weight or costs. The Marine ACV is attempting to be fast and as protected as it can while keeping costs down. Electrical power generation is important given the growing number of dismounted electronics. The Army [[Stryker]] can generate 50 percent more electricity than the [[M2 Bradley]], but that requires a larger engine and higher costs. General Amos had previously wanted to procure the JLTV as fast as possible to be ready for ACV production, but with sequestration giving up buying the JLTV for the Marine Corps was seriously being considered. The ACV is strictly a Marine Corps program without a basic design settled upon yet. Its best hope is to show it can be part of the military's [[AirSea Battle]] strategy to seize and defend island bases, which is primarily the Marine Corps' mission.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/marines-2014-year-of-decision-for-amphibious-combat-vehicle/ Marines 2014: Year Of Decision For Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - Breakingdefense.com, 9 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, General Amos signaled a \"phased approach\" to creating the ACV in which he lessened the importance of speed on water as an immediate requirement for the vehicle. Speed on water had been identified as a crucial need to quickly reach the beach so Marines could fight inland. Given budgetary pressures, Phase 1 of the program would consist of creating a vehicle they can afford quickly to replace the AAV, which are around 40 years old. Phase 2 would include future science and technology developments like higher speeds. The Phase 1 ACV seems to be an improved AAV that will drive straight through water like its predecessors, while attempts to create a sea-skimming vehicle led to the ill-fated EFV. While a high-speed amphibious vehicle is believed to be feasible and affordable, there would be too many trade-offs in performance capabilities. The main purpose of the ACV is to move Marines from ship-to-shore, but after that they primarily fight on land, asserting the need for ground fighting capabilities. Conventional ground fighting vehicles can be transported by landing craft like the [[Landing Craft Utility]] and [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]], but amphibious landing ships are able to carry many times more amtracs than they can other landing craft or hovercraft carrying vehicles. LCACs can move to a beach faster, but cannot travel inland and are not able to take enemy fire. Moving vehicles with few LCACs would require multiple trips, taking up time and leaving the hovercraft vulnerable for longer.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/amos-says-marines-to-drop-high-speed-acv-phased-approach-likely/ Amos Says Marines To Drop High Speed ACV, For Now; Phased Approach Likely] - Breakingdefense.com, 29 January 2014</ref>\n\n===Increments===\nShortly after the Marine Corps submitted their FY 2015 budget request in February 2014, General Amos decided to postpone development of the ACV and return funding to the Marine Personnel Carrier program. Originally, the Marines planned to buy both the ACV and MPC to replace outdated vehicles to complement each other for different missions. During an amphibious assault, a limited number of ACVs would carry the initial landing force from ship to shore and further inland. After the beach was secured, a larger number of MPCs would be landed by landing craft to reinforce the first wave. When budgets tightened, the ACV was taken as the priority and funding was removed from the MPC, with the service figuring they could buy an off-the-shelf wheeled troop transport later when money was available. Technical challenges to the proposed ACV continued to mount as funds kept getting constrained, so the decision was made that wheeled APC advancements where significant enough to address needs quicker. Marines still want a high-speed fully amphibious vehicle to move troops from the ocean to a beach with enough armor, mobility, and firepower to fight while on land, which was proposed as ACV Phase 2.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/02/marines-budget-scramble-commandant-resurrects-mpc-acv-in-limbo/ Marines Budget Scramble: Commandant Resurrects MPC, ACV In Limbo] - Breakingdefense.com, 17 February 2014</ref>\n\nThe Marine Corps plan to modernize its amphibious invasion force has three parts: upgrade 390 AAVs; buy 600 troop transports as part of ACV Phase 1; and do research for an ACV 2.0 \"high-water-speed\" option. Upgrades to the AAV will be added to around 392 vehicles (carrying one Marine brigade) out of the fleet of 1,062, including \"limited survivability upgrades\" of blast-resistant seats, additional armor, and a new transmission. Having AAVs self-deploy directly from ships is quicker than loading vehicles onto a connector, but long-range anti-ship missiles will force future amphibious invasion forces to stay between {{convert|25|-|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} from shore. A high-speed connector can make that trip in 1\u20133 hours, while an AAV on water would take 15 hours to travel that distance. The Phase 1 ACV will be 200 modified versions of an existing U.S. or foreign armored vehicle to enter service around 2020. It will have limited amphibious capabilities to cross rivers and coastal inlets and be carried on a landing craft miles from shore, which will deploy it {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the shoreline to swim the rest of the way. Seaborne requirements are likely for operation in [[Sea state#World Meteorological Organization sea state code|sea state 3]], against modest winds and {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}-high waves, taking about one hour. ACV 1.1 will likely have a higher swim standard than the previous MPC. ACV 1.2 is to buy an additional 400 amphibious vehicles in multiple variants including troop transport, command, and fire support. A Phase 1 ACV that can self-deploy without a landing craft would have an advantage, but that capability is not a requirement. ACV 2.0 is research for a new amphibious vehicle, a new fast landing craft for the ACV 1, or some undecided alternative. Aside from wartime amphibious assaults, the Marine Corps has other needs for amphibious vehicles. In relief operations during the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], there was no combat, but ships could not dock in the country's damaged ports, and helicopters could not move the amount of cargo necessary, so AAVs were relied upon to transport supplies ashore.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/marines-about-to-announce-new-amphibious-combat-vehicle-plan-our-sneak-preview/ A Sneak Peek At Marines' New Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - Breakingdefense.com, 2 April 2014</ref>\n\nA critique of the ACV effort authored by retired infantry officers and armor experts and published by ''[[Marine Corps Times]]'' in June 2014 were critical of developing a new amphibious personnel carrier. Due to the proliferation of anti-ship missiles, Navy ships will have to remain some 100 miles from a landing area. The critique claimed that an armored ACV would swim too slowly through the water and that the Marines would be relying on the Navy for the use of connectors to travel from the stand-off distance, despite the fact that no connectors currently exist to transport a mid-sized landing force. It recommended scrapping the ACV, modifying current Light Armored Vehicles, and emphasizing procurement of the [[CH-53K King Stallion]] to transport them. In response, General Amos defended the program and his decision to re-focus its priority from speed on water to ground performance. Since the mid-2000s, [[MRAP]] vehicles set a new standard for combat vehicle armor protection. With the ACV actually fighting on land, ruggedness and survivability are main features, so using a lighter and less-armored vehicle is not feasible. To transport them, Amos has suggested modifying Navy [[Joint High Speed Vessel]]s with a ramp to deploy the ACV; a JHSV with a ramp can carry up to 30 of the vehicles, go from the fleet to the coast at 50&nbsp;mph, and drop them off to swim the rest of the way to shore. Assistance could be provided by DARPA and the [[Office of Naval Research]] to add more technologies and capabilities to existing or future connectors.<ref>[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20140625/NEWS04/306250073/Amos-rejects-recent-critique-amphibious-combat-vehicle \"Amos rejects recent critique of amphibious combat vehicle\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712084927/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20140625/NEWS04/306250073/Amos-rejects-recent-critique-amphibious-combat-vehicle |date=2014-07-12 }}, ''Marine Corps Times'', 25 June 2014</ref>\n\nOn 11 July 2014, [[General Dynamics]] was awarded a contract extension to continue work on determining the best option for developing an affordable, survivable, and high water speed ACV platform.

A future Marine expeditionary brigade operation would require 400 AAVs and 700 ACVs distributed through a series of naval connectors over a series of phases; due to the smaller vehicle manning capabilities of the ACV, fleet size would need to increase by one-quarter to one-third to move one [[company (military unit)|company]]. About 400 AAVs will be upgraded with MRAP-level protection features including enhanced underbelly armor, seating, fueling systems, and fire protection, which will begin deliveries in 2019; AAVs will still be part of the initial wave, while ACVs arrive in subsequent waves. ACV 1.1 includes the four competitors of the previous Marine Personnel Carrier program and their entries, as well as a fifth unnamed company. Results of ACV 1.1 vehicles will be used to generate requirements for ACV 1.2, an enhanced capability version of the original vehicle with potentially greater speed or carrying capacity, and available in probable mission variants. The ACVs will mainly be deployed using naval connectors to get from ship to shore, as will JLTVs, which the Marines will begin buying 5,500 of in 2015 as part of their wheeled vehicle modernization strategy. ACV Phase 2 is a planning construct to develop a high-speed, independently deploying vehicle, but there are several other options including creating two vehicles, another wheeled or tracked vehicle, and another high-speed naval connector. If ACV Phase 2 becomes infeasible, the Marine Corps fallback plan is the ACV 1.3, with a 600-vehicle buy to replace the AAV fleet.<ref>[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140924/NEWS04/309180081/Marines-upgrading-replacing-amphibs-under-new-strategy \"Marines upgrading, replacing amphibs under new strategy\"], ''Military Times'', 24 September 2014</ref>\n\nAn RFP for ACV 1.1 was issued in November 2014.  Even though the Marine Corps has spent $3.5 billion on four failed high-water speed amphibious vehicles over the past 25 years, such a vehicle is still a requirement for the Corps.  Creating a vehicle that can travel on water at 25 knots is technically feasible, but it requires tradeoffs to be made survivability and lethality.  Three possibilities are being explored to create a vehicle that can balance required capabilities for ACV Phase 2.  One is to upgrade the ACV Phase 1 vehicle or another existing vehicle to have high-water speed.  Another is the desired creation of an entirely new \"clean sheet\" design.  If neither of those paths can develop technologies for a vehicle, the last effort involves further development of ship-to-shore connectors to bring vehicles ashore.  The ONR, industry, and Navy personnel are exploring these possibilities and are to report their findings by 2025.<ref name=\"ndm18nov14\"/>\n\nIn March 2015, the Marines revealed that the separate ACV 1.1 and 1.2 increments may be merged into a single vehicle.  Given that the winner of phase 1.1 will likely be awarded the 1.2 contract, industry is already planning to make their submissions meet the later requirements early.  The main differences between the phases is the 1.2's greater self-deploying capability and more seating capacity.  Merging the two phases to meet higher requirements earlier could speed up the acquisition timeline and drive down price, since the quantities for both would be bought in bulk.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/03/11/marines-may-merge-acv-increments-as-industry-chases-higher-requirements Marines May Merge ACV Increments as Industry Chases Higher Requirements] - News.USNI.org, 11 March 2015</ref> The Marines released the final RFP for ACV 1.1 on 26 March 2015.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/04/01/marine-corps-releases-amphibious-combat-vehicle-rfp Marine Corps Releases Amphibious Combat Vehicle RFP] - News.USNI.org, 1 April 2015</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Lockheed Martin revealed it had ended its association with Finnish company [[Patria (company)|Patria]] on their previous collaborative [[Patria AMV#Havoc|Havoc]] offering for the program.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/july_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/lockheed_martin_ends_collaboration_with_patria_on_havoc_will_present_its_own_design_for_acv.html Lockheed Martin Ends Collaboration with Patria on Havoc & Will Present its Own Design for ACV] - Armyrecognition.com, 11 July 2015</ref> Lockheed unveiled their new ACV offering in September 2015.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/september_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/lockheed_martin_introduces_new_acv_candidate_at_modern_day_marine_show_42309151.html Lockheed Martin Introduces New ACV Candidate at Modern Day Marine Show] - Armyrecognition.com, 23 September 2015</ref>\n\nIn October 2017 deputy Marine commandant Lt.

The question remains if the Marines are still interested in procuring a high speed connector vehicle after merging ACV 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n[[File:US Marine Corps ACV 1.1 Prototype Vehicles.png|border|center|750px]]\nIn May 2018 a former Marine officer, Jeff Groom, published an article concerning the Amphibious Combat Vehicle.

However there is apparently no longer a need for speed on water as both test vehicles move through the water at 7 knots using traditional water propellers, the same speed as the legacy 1970s AAV. The article questioned the acquisition decision of a vehicle that swims at the same speed as the vehicle it replaces, carries fewer troops, and is more expensive.<ref>http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/amphibious-vehicles-are-the-militarys-latest-tax-dollar-sinkhole/</ref>\n\n===EMD phase===\nOn 24 November 2015, the Marines selected the [[BAE Systems]] [[Iveco SuperAV|SuperAV]] and [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] [[Terrex]] to move on to the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the ACV 1.1 program, beating out Lockheed Martin, [[General Dynamics]], and Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems.  The Marine Corps valued swim operations, land operations, carrying capability, and force protection equally in the selection process, but the two winners were chosen for emphasis focused on amphibious swim capability, since the ACV is \"fundamentally an amphibious vehicle.\"  Each company was awarded a contract to build 16 vehicles by late 2016, 13 initially and three more when funding becomes available, with testing beginning in early 2017 and lasting one year.  A winner is planned to be selected in 2018 to build 204 vehicles, with the first entering service in 2020 and all delivered by 2023.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/11/24/bae-saic-named-finalists-marines-acv-competition/76312760/ BAE, SAIC Named as Finalists in Marines ACV Competition] - Defensenews.com, 24 November 2015</ref><ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/11/24/marine-corps-awards-amphibious-combat-vechicle-1-1-contracts-to-bae-systems-and-saic Marine Corps Awards Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 Contracts to BAE Systems and SAIC] - News.USNI.org, 24 November 2015</ref>\n\n===Selection and contract===\nIn June 2018, the BAE design was selected, with an initial order or 30 ACVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.defenseone.com/business/2018/06/marines-buy-new-amphibious-combat-vehicle-bae-systems/149141/?oref=DefenseOneTCO |title=Marines to Buy New Amphibious Combat Vehicle from BAE Systems |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 June 2018 |website=defenseone.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019 BAE Systems and Iveco were awarded a contract to develop Command and 30mm gun armed variants.<ref>https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/us-marine-corps-awards-bae-contract-for-acv-family-of-vehicles/?no_cache=1</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe variants include the Squad Maneuver/Fighting Vehicle, the [[Command and Control Vehicle]], and the Recovery and [[Maintenance Vehicle]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n{{Marine Corps}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web\n |last= Feickert\n |first= Andrew\n |title= Marine Corps Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC): Background and Issues for Congress\n |publisher= [[Congressional Research Service]]\n |date= 2 January 2013\n |url= http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R42723.pdf\n |accessdate= 7 January 2013\n |format= PDF\n |id= R42723}}\n* [http://www.defensenews.com/story/military/tech/2015/03/11/marine-general-defends-acv-at-sasc-hearing/70170834/ Marine 3-star defends next-gen amphibious vehicle]\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline|Amphibious combat vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps projects]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Amphibious combat vehicle|the category of military vehicles|Amphibious vehicle#Tracked}}\n{{distinguish|text=the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle, now known as the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]]}}\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name= Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV)\n|image=US Marine Corps ACV Testing.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=ACV testing at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]]\n|origin= United States\n|type=[[amphibious vehicle|Amphibious]] [[Combat vehicle|assault vehicle]]\n<!-- Type selection -->\n|is_vehicle=yes\n<!-- Service history -->\n|service=\n|used_by=[[United States Marine Corps]]\n|wars= \n<!-- Production history -->\n|designer=\n|design_date=\n|manufacturer=\n|production_date= \n|unit_cost=\n|number= \n|variants=\n<!-- General specifications -->\n|spec_label= \n|weight=\n|length=\n|part_length=\n|width=\n|height=\n|height in water=\n|diameter=\n|crew=\n|passengers=\n<!-- Vehicle/missile specifications -->\n|armour=\n|primary_armament=\n|secondary_armament=\n|engine=\n|engine type=\n|engine_power=\n|transmission=\n|pw_ratio=\n|suspension=\n|fuel_capacity=\n|vehicle_range=\n|speed=\n|guidance=\n|steering=\n}}\nThe '''Amphibious Combat Vehicle''' ('''ACV''') is a program initiated by [[Marine Corps Systems Command]] to procure an [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious assault vehicle]] for the [[United States Marine Corps]] to supplement and ultimately replace the aging [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle]].

It will rely on connectors to get it from ship-to-shore, like the [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]] and [[Joint High Speed Vessel]]. Relying on connectors to bring the vehicle to a beach allows the sea base to be located 100 miles from enemy threats. The less ambitious Phase 1 ACV will be fielded in the interim, while research and development will commence to refine the features of the Phase 2 ACV.<ref>[http://defensetech.org/2014/04/04/marine-corps-scraps-tracks-for-amphibious-combat-vehicle/ Marine Corps Scraps Tracks for Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - Defensetech.org, 4 April 2014</ref>\n\nPhase 1.1, the first increment of Phase 1 of procurement, will buy wheeled personnel carriers.

For the second lot buy (1.2), engineering and design changes will be made to meet roughly half of desired amphibious vehicle fleet size requirements. \n\nThe ACV 1.1 is to carry 10\u201313 Marines, have a swim capability similar to the AAV, and have equal or greater mobility to the M1 Abrams tank. Although tracks are traditionally considered better for all-terrain mobility, the Marines believe wheeled vehicle technology has advanced enough to enhance survivability and mobility in a 35-ton-class platform; the [[Marine Personnel Carrier]] technology demonstrator used \"in-line\" drive technology that enabled all four wheels on each side to pull together much like the way a track does. This demonstrated ability when combined with a higher ground clearance and central tire inflation system, substantially closes the maneuverability gap for wheeled vehicles and results in equal or better maneuverability than the M1A1 and better performance over the AAV, both of which are tracked. \n\nImproved technology used to inform requirements to build ACV 1.2 vehicles will later be applied to delivered 1.1 versions to upgrade them to 1.2 standard.<ref>[http://www.mcafdn.org/gazette/2014/09/amphibious-combat-vehicle The Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - MCafdn.org, 10 September 2014</ref><ref>[http://defensetech.org/2014/09/25/corps-eyes-new-amphibious-assault-vehicles/ Corps Eyes New Amphibious Assault Vehicles] - Defensetech.org, 25 September 2014</ref> Each ACV 1.1 vehicle will have a 3-man crew, and two vehicles will carry a reinforced rifle squad.

The team beat out 1,000 other competitors to submit their design for a drivetrain for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. The FANG initiative was to demonstrate a way to procure working systems better than the current defense acquisition process, which frequently leads to delays and cost overruns. The Marines are in charge of the ACV program, so there was no guarantee that the Darpa-crowdsourced mobility drivetrain would result in a vehicle bought by the Corps.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/darpa-fang-winner/ This Is the Million-Dollar Design for Darpa\u2019s Crowdsourced Swimming Tank] - Wired.com, April 22, 2013</ref>\n\nAt a roundtable discussion on 26 June 2013, Marine Corps General [[James F. Amos|Jim Amos]] told the media that the program was still being pursued, and that a [[request for proposals]] (RFP) would be issued in early 2014. The Corps has secured and saved a \u201cmoderate amount\u201d of money for early development. With the previous Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle cancelled from cost overruns, the Marines are being cautious to identify trade-offs between requirements and cost for the platform. Amos noted that they were working with contractors to see which type of vehicle would meet requirements without proving too costly.<ref>[http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_06_26_2013_p0-591775.xml RFP For Marine Corps ACV Expected In 2014] - Aviationweek.com, 26 June 2013</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, the ACV team was created and tasked to evaluate the feasibility of building an affordable, survivable amphibious high water speed vehicle. The team includes representatives from over six Department of Defense commands. Their initial requirements and engineering analysis evaluated 198 requirements for the platform. From July 9\u201311, 2013, 25 Marines gathered at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia]] for a Warfighter Requirements Workshop to review the team's capabilities analysis and determine the value of various capabilities. 30 requirements with cost and weight implications were considered \"tradable,\" including armament and armor protection. Safety and design-specific capabilities, like transportability (fitting on an amphibious ship) were considered non-tradable. The point of the workshop was to get input from fleet Marines about what capabilities they wanted to prioritize with current financial pressures. Over the next month, the team ordered the preferences and applied actual cost and weight data to determine feasibility recommendations for Marine Corps leaders by the fall.<ref>[http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/News/PressReleaseArticleDisplay/tabid/8007/Article/146253/acv-team-seeks-marines-insight-into-vehicle-requirements.aspx ACV team seeks Marines\u2019 insight into vehicle requirements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201021/http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/News/PressReleaseArticleDisplay/tabid/8007/Article/146253/acv-team-seeks-marines-insight-into-vehicle-requirements.aspx |date=October 29, 2013 }} - MarCorSysCom.Marines.mil, 15 July 2013</ref>\n\nThe Marine Corps feels they have only one opportunity to get the ACV program right, partly from the previous EFV program being cancelled in 2011 after using $3 billion in development and also from severely reduced budgets for the rest of the decade compared to the previous one. They may not even know exactly what they want and can afford from the vehicle. Trade studies began in January 2013 and were to be conducted for six months, but they were extended another six months. With the service's normally tight budget combined with sequester cuts, giving priority to the ACV may take funding and resources from other programs. The plan to begin buying 5,500 [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]]s around 2019 could have been replaced with retaining and modernizing up-armored [[Humvee]]s and keeping the large numbers of relatively young [[Oshkosh M-ATV]]s. The Corps' preference for the ACV over the JLTV and willingness to sacrifice it is partly to maintain the ability to make amphibious landings. The amphibious-capable [[Marine Personnel Carrier]] is a program to create a better vehicle to transport Marines after they come ashore. In June 2013, budgetary pressures forced the MPC program to be suspended for up to a decade to focus funding on other priorities.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130920/DEFREG02/309200011/ Marines Tread Carefully in Search for New Amphibious Vehicle] - Defensenews.com, 20 September 2013</ref>\n\nGeneral Amos received an analysis of ACV alternatives in November 2013, so it was unlikely he could make a decision on whether to develop or buy a vehicle in the Marine's FY 2015 budget request, due February 2014. Despite the Marine's ship-to-shore amphibious landing role and the ACV being declared the service's number-one priority, there are factors that put its future in doubt. Options for vehicle capabilities were to create a high-speed platform that meets desired goals which may come out to be too expensive like the previous EFV program, create a low-speed platform with reduced performance for affordability which may not be enough of an improvement over the AAV it is replacing, or delay the effort for more research and development time to refine requirements and wait for budget problems to pass. If creating a new amphibious vehicle were delayed, the Marines would have to rely more on the [[MV-22 Osprey]] and other helicopters in the near-future for moving troops to a breach, which cannot support them on the ground or protect them under armor. A high-speed vehicle may not even be viable for future assault landings, as even though it would be made to deploy further out to sea to give stand-off protection of transport ships from anti-ship missiles, the ACV itself would then be vulnerable to those missiles. Methods of traveling on water are limited to current and slow methods through it or traveling on top, similar to a [[jet ski]], which is expensive. How an amphibious vehicle will perform fighting on land is uncertain. AAVs had mixed success in Iraq and were vulnerable to [[improvised explosive device]]s, which endangers more troops with the higher carrying capacity of amphibious vehicles over regular [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. The [[U.S. Army]] faced the same threats, and their [[Ground Combat Vehicle]] program aimed for the greatest protection without excessive weight or costs. The Marine ACV is attempting to be fast and as protected as it can while keeping costs down. Electrical power generation is important given the growing number of dismounted electronics. The Army [[Stryker]] can generate 50 percent more electricity than the [[M2 Bradley]], but that requires a larger engine and higher costs. General Amos had previously wanted to procure the JLTV as fast as possible to be ready for ACV production, but with sequestration giving up buying the JLTV for the Marine Corps was seriously being considered. The ACV is strictly a Marine Corps program without a basic design settled upon yet. Its best hope is to show it can be part of the military's [[AirSea Battle]] strategy to seize and defend island bases, which is primarily the Marine Corps' mission.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/marines-2014-year-of-decision-for-amphibious-combat-vehicle/ Marines 2014: Year Of Decision For Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - Breakingdefense.com, 9 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, General Amos signaled a \"phased approach\" to creating the ACV in which he lessened the importance of speed on water as an immediate requirement for the vehicle. Speed on water had been identified as a crucial need to quickly reach the beach so Marines could fight inland. Given budgetary pressures, Phase 1 of the program would consist of creating a vehicle they can afford quickly to replace the AAV, which are around 40 years old. Phase 2 would include future science and technology developments like higher speeds. The Phase 1 ACV seems to be an improved AAV that will drive straight through water like its predecessors, while attempts to create a sea-skimming vehicle led to the ill-fated EFV. While a high-speed amphibious vehicle is believed to be feasible and affordable, there would be too many trade-offs in performance capabilities. The main purpose of the ACV is to move Marines from ship-to-shore, but after that they primarily fight on land, asserting the need for ground fighting capabilities. Conventional ground fighting vehicles can be transported by landing craft like the [[Landing Craft Utility]] and [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]], but amphibious landing ships are able to carry many times more amtracs than they can other landing craft or hovercraft carrying vehicles. LCACs can move to a beach faster, but cannot travel inland and are not able to take enemy fire. Moving vehicles with few LCACs would require multiple trips, taking up time and leaving the hovercraft vulnerable for longer.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/amos-says-marines-to-drop-high-speed-acv-phased-approach-likely/ Amos Says Marines To Drop High Speed ACV, For Now; Phased Approach Likely] - Breakingdefense.com, 29 January 2014</ref>\n\n===Increments===\nShortly after the Marine Corps submitted their FY 2015 budget request in February 2014, General Amos decided to postpone development of the ACV and return funding to the Marine Personnel Carrier program. Originally, the Marines planned to buy both the ACV and MPC to replace outdated vehicles to complement each other for different missions. During an amphibious assault, a limited number of ACVs would carry the initial landing force from ship to shore and further inland. After the beach was secured, a larger number of MPCs would be landed by landing craft to reinforce the first wave. When budgets tightened, the ACV was taken as the priority and funding was removed from the MPC, with the service figuring they could buy an off-the-shelf wheeled troop transport later when money was available. Technical challenges to the proposed ACV continued to mount as funds kept getting constrained, so the decision was made that wheeled APC advancements where significant enough to address needs quicker. Marines still want a high-speed fully amphibious vehicle to move troops from the ocean to a beach with enough armor, mobility, and firepower to fight while on land, which was proposed as ACV Phase 2.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/02/marines-budget-scramble-commandant-resurrects-mpc-acv-in-limbo/ Marines Budget Scramble: Commandant Resurrects MPC, ACV In Limbo] - Breakingdefense.com, 17 February 2014</ref>\n\nThe Marine Corps plan to modernize its amphibious invasion force has three parts: upgrade 390 AAVs; buy 600 troop transports as part of ACV Phase 1; and do research for an ACV 2.0 \"high-water-speed\" option. Upgrades to the AAV will be added to around 392 vehicles (carrying one Marine brigade) out of the fleet of 1,062, including \"limited survivability upgrades\" of blast-resistant seats, additional armor, and a new transmission. Having AAVs self-deploy directly from ships is quicker than loading vehicles onto a connector, but long-range anti-ship missiles will force future amphibious invasion forces to stay between {{convert|25|-|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} from shore. A high-speed connector can make that trip in 1\u20133 hours, while an AAV on water would take 15 hours to travel that distance. The Phase 1 ACV will be 200 modified versions of an existing U.S. or foreign armored vehicle to enter service around 2020. It will have limited amphibious capabilities to cross rivers and coastal inlets and be carried on a landing craft miles from shore, which will deploy it {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the shoreline to swim the rest of the way. Seaborne requirements are likely for operation in [[Sea state#World Meteorological Organization sea state code|sea state 3]], against modest winds and {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}-high waves, taking about one hour. ACV 1.1 will likely have a higher swim standard than the previous MPC. ACV 1.2 is to buy an additional 400 amphibious vehicles in multiple variants including troop transport, command, and fire support. A Phase 1 ACV that can self-deploy without a landing craft would have an advantage, but that capability is not a requirement. ACV 2.0 is research for a new amphibious vehicle, a new fast landing craft for the ACV 1, or some undecided alternative. Aside from wartime amphibious assaults, the Marine Corps has other needs for amphibious vehicles. In relief operations during the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], there was no combat, but ships could not dock in the country's damaged ports, and helicopters could not move the amount of cargo necessary, so AAVs were relied upon to transport supplies ashore.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/marines-about-to-announce-new-amphibious-combat-vehicle-plan-our-sneak-preview/ A Sneak Peek At Marines' New Amphibious Combat Vehicle] - Breakingdefense.com, 2 April 2014</ref>\n\nA critique of the ACV effort authored by retired infantry officers and armor experts and published by ''[[Marine Corps Times]]'' in June 2014 were critical of developing a new amphibious personnel carrier. Due to the proliferation of anti-ship missiles, Navy ships will have to remain some 100 miles from a landing area. The critique claimed that an armored ACV would swim too slowly through the water and that the Marines would be relying on the Navy for the use of connectors to travel from the stand-off distance, despite the fact that no connectors currently exist to transport a mid-sized landing force. It recommended scrapping the ACV, modifying current Light Armored Vehicles, and emphasizing procurement of the [[CH-53K King Stallion]] to transport them. In response, General Amos defended the program and his decision to re-focus its priority from speed on water to ground performance. Since the mid-2000s, [[MRAP]] vehicles set a new standard for combat vehicle armor protection. With the ACV actually fighting on land, ruggedness and survivability are main features, so using a lighter and less-armored vehicle is not feasible. To transport them, Amos has suggested modifying Navy [[Joint High Speed Vessel]]s with a ramp to deploy the ACV; a JHSV with a ramp can carry up to 30 of the vehicles, go from the fleet to the coast at 50&nbsp;mph, and drop them off to swim the rest of the way to shore. Assistance could be provided by DARPA and the [[Office of Naval Research]] to add more technologies and capabilities to existing or future connectors.<ref>[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20140625/NEWS04/306250073/Amos-rejects-recent-critique-amphibious-combat-vehicle \"Amos rejects recent critique of amphibious combat vehicle\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712084927/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20140625/NEWS04/306250073/Amos-rejects-recent-critique-amphibious-combat-vehicle |date=2014-07-12 }}, ''Marine Corps Times'', 25 June 2014</ref>\n\nOn 11 July 2014, [[General Dynamics]] was awarded a contract extension to continue work on determining the best option for developing an affordable, survivable, and high water speed ACV platform. The effort includes analyzing the flexibility and modularity of requirements, concept refinement, and experimentation planning to help the [[Marine Corps]] understand risks and determine the best approach for ACV development.<ref>[http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20140711-gd-acv.html \"General Dynamics to Continue Amphibious Combat Vehicle Testing for Marine Corps\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728052428/http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20140711-gd-acv.html |date=July 28, 2014 }}, ''Seapower Magazine'', 11 July 2014</ref>\n\nAmphibious Combat Vehicle developments are incorporated into the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Force 21 future amphibious assault strategy, which rely on launching 65\u2013100 miles from shore in small landing teams to exploit gaps in enemy defenses, rather than previous methods of deploying a large contingent across a beach in a major assault. A future Marine expeditionary brigade operation would require 400 AAVs and 700 ACVs distributed through a series of naval connectors over a series of phases; due to the smaller vehicle manning capabilities of the ACV, fleet size would need to increase by one-quarter to one-third to move one [[company (military unit)|company]]. About 400 AAVs will be upgraded with MRAP-level protection features including enhanced underbelly armor, seating, fueling systems, and fire protection, which will begin deliveries in 2019; AAVs will still be part of the initial wave, while ACVs arrive in subsequent waves. ACV 1.1 includes the four competitors of the previous Marine Personnel Carrier program and their entries, as well as a fifth unnamed company. Results of ACV 1.1 vehicles will be used to generate requirements for ACV 1.2, an enhanced capability version of the original vehicle with potentially greater speed or carrying capacity, and available in probable mission variants. The ACVs will mainly be deployed using naval connectors to get from ship to shore, as will JLTVs, which the Marines will begin buying 5,500 of in 2015 as part of their wheeled vehicle modernization strategy. ACV Phase 2 is a planning construct to develop a high-speed, independently deploying vehicle, but there are several other options including creating two vehicles, another wheeled or tracked vehicle, and another high-speed naval connector. If ACV Phase 2 becomes infeasible, the Marine Corps fallback plan is the ACV 1.3, with a 600-vehicle buy to replace the AAV fleet.<ref>[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140924/NEWS04/309180081/Marines-upgrading-replacing-amphibs-under-new-strategy \"Marines upgrading, replacing amphibs under new strategy\"], ''Military Times'', 24 September 2014</ref>\n\nAn RFP for ACV 1.1 was issued in November 2014.  Even though the Marine Corps has spent $3.5 billion on four failed high-water speed amphibious vehicles over the past 25 years, such a vehicle is still a requirement for the Corps.  Creating a vehicle that can travel on water at 25 knots is technically feasible, but it requires tradeoffs to be made survivability and lethality.  Three possibilities are being explored to create a vehicle that can balance required capabilities for ACV Phase 2.  One is to upgrade the ACV Phase 1 vehicle or another existing vehicle to have high-water speed.  Another is the desired creation of an entirely new \"clean sheet\" design.  If neither of those paths can develop technologies for a vehicle, the last effort involves further development of ship-to-shore connectors to bring vehicles ashore.  The ONR, industry, and Navy personnel are exploring these possibilities and are to report their findings by 2025.<ref name=\"ndm18nov14\"/>\n\nIn March 2015, the Marines revealed that the separate ACV 1.1 and 1.2 increments may be merged into a single vehicle.  Given that the winner of phase 1.1 will likely be awarded the 1.2 contract, industry is already planning to make their submissions meet the later requirements early.  The main differences between the phases is the 1.2's greater self-deploying capability and more seating capacity.  Merging the two phases to meet higher requirements earlier could speed up the acquisition timeline and drive down price, since the quantities for both would be bought in bulk.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/03/11/marines-may-merge-acv-increments-as-industry-chases-higher-requirements Marines May Merge ACV Increments as Industry Chases Higher Requirements] - News.USNI.org, 11 March 2015</ref> The Marines released the final RFP for ACV 1.1 on 26 March 2015.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/04/01/marine-corps-releases-amphibious-combat-vehicle-rfp Marine Corps Releases Amphibious Combat Vehicle RFP] - News.USNI.org, 1 April 2015</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Lockheed Martin revealed it had ended its association with Finnish company [[Patria (company)|Patria]] on their previous collaborative [[Patria AMV#Havoc|Havoc]] offering for the program.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/july_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/lockheed_martin_ends_collaboration_with_patria_on_havoc_will_present_its_own_design_for_acv.html Lockheed Martin Ends Collaboration with Patria on Havoc & Will Present its Own Design for ACV] - Armyrecognition.com, 11 July 2015</ref> Lockheed unveiled their new ACV offering in September 2015.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/september_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/lockheed_martin_introduces_new_acv_candidate_at_modern_day_marine_show_42309151.html Lockheed Martin Introduces New ACV Candidate at Modern Day Marine Show] - Armyrecognition.com, 23 September 2015</ref>\n\nIn October 2017 deputy Marine commandant Lt. Gen. Brian Beaudreault stated \u201cWe have to find a solution to getting Marines to shore, from over the horizon, at something greater than seven knots (8 mph),\u201d the swimming speed of the existing Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) and its Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) replacement. Continuing, he said \u201cwe must find a high-water-speed vehicle on the surface. We must.\u201d <ref>https://breakingdefense.com/2017/10/marines-need-speed-from-ship-to-shore/</ref>\n\nThe deputy commandant's statements seemly contradict the phased approach to having a non-self deploying vehicle in the ACV 1.1 and then a fully amphibious vehicle in ACV 1.2. The question remains if the Marines are still interested in procuring a high speed connector vehicle after merging ACV 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n[[File:US Marine Corps ACV 1.1 Prototype Vehicles.png|border|right|650px]]\nIn May 2018 a former Marine officer, Jeff Groom, published an article concerning the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. Both BAE System's and SAIC's ACV 1.1 test vehicles could self-deploy and swim from a ship in contradiction to General Dunford's testimony in March 2015. However there is apparently no longer a need for speed on water as both test vehicles move through the water at 7 knots using traditional water propellers, the same speed as the legacy 1970s AAV. The article questioned the acquisition decision of a vehicle that swims at the same speed as the vehicle it replaces, carries fewer troops, and is more expensive.<ref>http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/amphibious-vehicles-are-the-militarys-latest-tax-dollar-sinkhole/</ref>\n\n===EMD phase===\nOn 24 November 2015, the Marines selected the [[BAE Systems]] [[Iveco SuperAV|SuperAV]] and [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] [[Terrex]] to move on to the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the ACV 1.1 program, beating out Lockheed Martin, [[General Dynamics]], and Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems.  The Marine Corps valued swim operations, land operations, carrying capability, and force protection equally in the selection process, but the two winners were chosen for emphasis focused on amphibious swim capability, since the ACV is \"fundamentally an amphibious vehicle.\"  Each company was awarded a contract to build 16 vehicles by late 2016, 13 initially and three more when funding becomes available, with testing beginning in early 2017 and lasting one year.  A winner is planned to be selected in 2018 to build 204 vehicles, with the first entering service in 2020 and all delivered by 2023.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/11/24/bae-saic-named-finalists-marines-acv-competition/76312760/ BAE, SAIC Named as Finalists in Marines ACV Competition] - Defensenews.com, 24 November 2015</ref><ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/11/24/marine-corps-awards-amphibious-combat-vechicle-1-1-contracts-to-bae-systems-and-saic Marine Corps Awards Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 Contracts to BAE Systems and SAIC] - News.USNI.org, 24 November 2015</ref>\n\n===Selection and contract===\nIn June 2018, the BAE design was selected, with an initial order or 30 ACVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.defenseone.com/business/2018/06/marines-buy-new-amphibious-combat-vehicle-bae-systems/149141/?oref=DefenseOneTCO |title=Marines to Buy New Amphibious Combat Vehicle from BAE Systems |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 June 2018 |website=defenseone.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019 BAE Systems and Iveco were awarded a contract to develop Command and 30mm gun armed variants.<ref>https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/us-marine-corps-awards-bae-contract-for-acv-family-of-vehicles/?no_cache=1</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe variants include the Squad Maneuver/Fighting Vehicle, the [[Command and Control Vehicle]], and the Recovery and [[Maintenance Vehicle]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n{{Marine Corps}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web\n |last= Feickert\n |first= Andrew\n |title= Marine Corps Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC): Background and Issues for Congress\n |publisher= [[Congressional Research Service]]\n |date= 2 January 2013\n |url= http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R42723.pdf\n |accessdate= 7 January 2013\n |format= PDF\n |id= R42723}}\n* [http://www.defensenews.com/story/military/tech/2015/03/11/marine-general-defends-acv-at-sasc-hearing/70170834/ Marine 3-star defends next-gen amphibious vehicle]\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline|Amphibious combat vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps projects]]\n", "name_user": "McChizzle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIncrements:Minor image format edit to better read caption", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_Combat_Vehicle"}
