{"title_page": "Flight-to-quality", "text_new": "A '''flight-to-quality''', or '''flight-to-safety''', is a financial market phenomenon occurring when investors sell what they perceive to be higher-[[risk]] investments and purchase safer investments, such as [[Gold as an investment|gold]] and other precious metals. This is considered a sign of [[fear]] in the marketplace, as investors seek less risk in exchange for lower [[Profit (accounting)|profits]].\n\nFlight-to-quality is usually accompanied by an increase in demand for assets that are government-backed and a decline in demand for assets backed by private agents.\n\n==Definition==\nMore broadly, flight-to-quality refers to a sudden shift in investment behaviors in a period of financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil. Such a portfolio shift further exposes the financial sector to negative shocks. An increase in leverage and credit spread on all but the safest and most liquid assets may incur a sudden dry up in risky asset markets, which may lead to real effects on the economy.\n\nA phenomenon that occurs with flight-to-quality is flight-to-liquidity. A [[flight-to-liquidity]] refers to an abrupt shift in large capital flows towards more liquid assets. One reason why the two appear together is that in most cases risky assets are also less liquid. Assets that are subject to the flight to quality pattern are also subject to flight to liquidity. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is less risky and more liquid than a corporate bond. Thus, most theoretical studies that attempt to explain underlying mechanisms take both flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity into account.\n\n==Mechanism==\nFlight-to-quality episodes are triggered by unusual and unexpected events.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a\nFlight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> These events are rare but the list is longer than a few. The [[Penn Central Railroad]]\u2019s default in 1970, a sudden stock market crash referred to as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the [[Russian debt default]] and collapse of [[Long Term Capital Management]] in 1998, the [[9/11 attack]] in 2001, and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008, were all unusual and unexpected events that caught market participants by surprise. The initial effects of these events were a fall in asset prices and aggregate quantity of [[liquidity]] in [[financial market]] which deteriorated balance sheets of both borrowers and investors.\n\nWorsening of initial impacts developed into a flight-to-quality pattern, as the unusual and unexpected features of the events made market participants more risk and uncertainty averse, incurring more aggressive reactions compared to responses during other shocks. Liquidation of assets and withdrawals from financial market were severe, which made a risky group of borrowers have difficulties rolling over their liabilities and financing new credits.\n\nA recent development in theory explains various mechanisms which led to enhanced initial effects of a flight-to-quality pattern.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \"Flight to Quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\" Working Paper 08-21.</ref><ref>Krishnamurthy, Arvind, 2010: \"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises.\" American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2(3): 1\u201330.</ref> These mechanisms follow from an observation that a flight-to-quality pattern involves a combination of market participants' weakening [[balance sheet]] and [[risk aversion]] of asset payoffs, extreme uncertainty aversion, and strategic or speculative behavior of liquid market participants. \n\nA \"balance sheet mechanism\" focuses on institutional features of financial markets. It provides an explanation for feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' balance sheets depend on asset prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock. Vayanos<ref>Vayanos, Dimitri (2004). \"Flight to Quality, Flight to Liquidity, and the Pricing of Risk>\" NBER Working Paper.</ref> models how a relationship between fund managers and clients can lead to effective risk aversion when illiquidity risk rises due to asset price volatility. He and Krishnamurthy<ref>He, Zhiguo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"A Model of Capital and Crises.\" Working Paper, Northwestern University.</ref> introduce [[principal\u2013agent problem]] to a model to show how specialists\u2019 capital investments are pro-cyclical. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2008) \"Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity.\" Review of Financial Studies, 22(6), 2201-2238.</ref> model [[margin requirement]] and show how volatility of asset prices tightens the requirement that lead to asset sales.\n\nAn \"information amplification mechanism\" focuses on a role of investor's extreme uncertainty aversion. When an unusual and unexpected event incurs losses, investors find that they do not have a good understanding about the tail outcome that they are facing and treat the risk as [[Knightian uncertainty]].<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> An example is [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008. Investors realized that they did not have good understanding about [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] which were newly adopted. Newly adopted financial innovation meant that market participants had only a short time to formulate valuation, and did not have enough history to refer to in their risk management and hedging models. Under Knightian uncertainty, investors respond by disengaging from risky activities and hoarding liquidity while reevaluating their investment models. They only take conservative approaches, investing on only safe and uncontingent claims, to protect themselves from worst-case scenarios related to the risk that they do not understand, which further deteriorates asset prices and financial market.\n\nA model of strategic or speculative behaviors of liquid investors provides another mechanism that explains flight-to-quality phenomenon. Acharya ''et al''<ref>Acharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \"Imperfect Competition in the Inter\u2010Bank Market for Liquidity.\" Working Paper, London Business School.</ref> show that during financial turmoil liquid banks in interbank loan markets do not lend their liquidity to illiquid banks, nor hoard liquidity for precautionary reasons, but, rather, hoard them to purchase assets at distress prices. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2005) \"Predatory Trading.\" The Journal of Finance, 60(4), 1825-1863.</ref> study strategic behaviors of liquid traders when they know that other traders need to liquidate their positions. The study shows that the strategic behaviors would lead to predatory pricing, which would lead the price of risky and illiquid assets to fall further than they would if price were based on risk consideration alone.\n\n==Empirical studies==\nSince flight-to-quality phenomenon implies a shift in investing behavior towards some safe group of assets from risky assets, efforts to find evidence on flight-to-quality have been concentrated on analyzing widening yields or quantity changes between two assets. A number of studies find stronger negative association between stock and bond markets during a financial turmoil. Flight-to-quality is also observable within a safe group of assets. Longstaff<ref>Longstaff, Francis (2004) \"The Flight\u2010to\u2010Liquidity Premium in US Treasury Bond Prices.\" The Journal of Business, 77(3):511\u2010526.</ref> finds a spread between [[Resolution Funding Corporation]] bonds, whose liabilities are guaranteed by Treasury, and US Treasury bonds increases when consumer confidence drops, money market mutual funds and Treasury buy backs increase. Krishnamurthy compares on-the-run and off-the-run treasury bonds to find higher spreads on off-the \u2013run bonds are associated with higher spread between commercial paper and Treasury bonds. Beber ''et al''<ref>Beber, Alessandro, Michael Brandt, and Kenneth A. Kavajecz (2009), Flight-to-quality or Flight-to-liquidity? Evidence from the Euro-area bond market, Review of Financial Studies 22, 925-957.</ref> make explicit distinction between flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity and find relative importance of liquidity over credit quality rises during flight-to-quality episodes. Gatev and Strahan <ref>Gatev, Evan and Philip Strahan (2006). \"Banks' Advantage in Hedging Liquidity Risk: Theory and Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market.\" ''The Journal of Finance'', 61(2):867\u2010892.</ref> find that the spread between treasury bills and high grade [[commercial paper]] increases, banks tend to experience inflow of deposits and decreased cost of funding. This suggests that banks tend to be seen as [[:wikt:safe haven|safe havens]] in periods of turmoil. However, data shows that during 1998 the flight-to-quality episodes worsening relative position of banks compared to the very safe assets.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" ''Journal of Finance'' 63, 2195-2230.</ref>\n\n==Real sector effects==\nDuring a flight-to-quality episode [[external financing]] becomes harder for lower quality borrowers or riskier projects. Investors faced with tightened balance sheet and increased risk and uncertainty aversion reduce their investment and shift their portfolio only towards safer projects and high quality borrowers.\nTightening external financing for lower quality borrowers may extend to real consequences of output loss and higher unemployment, therefore exacerbate business cycle. A series of studies show that amount and composition of firm's external financing from bank loans are countercyclical during flight-to quality periods. Kashyap ''et al'' <ref>Kashyap, Anil, Jeremy Stein, and David Wilcox (1993).\"Monetary Policy and Credit Conditions: Evidence from the Composition of External Finance.\" American Economic Review, 83(1), 78\u201098.</ref> finds that quantity of commercial paper issuances of high quality firms increase relative to bank loans.

This is considered a sign of [[fear]] in the marketplace, as investors seek less risk in exchange for lower [[Profit (accounting)|profits]].\n\nFlight-to-quality is usually accompanied by an increase in demand for assets that are government-backed and a decline in demand for assets backed by private agents.\n\n==Definition==\nMore broadly, flight-to-quality refers to a sudden shift in investment behaviors in a period of financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil. Such a portfolio shift further exposes the financial sector to negative shocks. An increase in leverage and credit spread on all but the safest and most liquid assets may incur a sudden dry up in risky asset markets, which may lead to real effects on the economy.\n\nA phenomenon that occurs with flight-to-quality is flight-to-liquidity. A [[flight-to-liquidity]] refers to an abrupt shift in large capital flows towards more liquid assets. One reason why the two appear together is that in most cases risky assets are also less liquid. Assets that are subject to the flight to quality pattern are also subject to flight to liquidity. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is less risky and more liquid than a corporate bond. Thus, most theoretical studies that attempt to explain underlying mechanisms take both flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity into account.\n\n==Mechanism==\nFlight-to-quality episodes are triggered by unusual and unexpected events.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a\nFlight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> These events are rare but the list is longer than a few. The [[Penn Central Railroad]]\u2019s default in 1970, a sudden stock market crash referred to as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the [[Russian debt default]] and collapse of [[Long Term Capital Management]] in 1998, the [[9/11 attack]] in 2001, and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008, were all unusual and unexpected events that caught market participants by surprise. The initial effects of these events were a fall in asset prices and aggregate quantity of [[liquidity]] in [[financial market]] which deteriorated balance sheets of both borrowers and investors.\n\nWorsening of initial impacts developed into a flight-to-quality pattern, as the unusual and unexpected features of the events made market participants more risk and uncertainty averse, incurring more aggressive reactions compared to responses during other shocks. Liquidation of assets and withdrawals from financial market were severe, which made a risky group of borrowers have difficulties rolling over their liabilities and financing new credits.\n\nA recent development in theory explains various mechanisms which led to enhanced initial effects of a flight-to-quality pattern.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \"Flight to Quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\" Working Paper 08-21.</ref><ref>Krishnamurthy, Arvind, 2010: \"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises.\" American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2(3): 1\u201330.</ref> These mechanisms follow from an observation that a flight-to-quality pattern involves a combination of market participants' weakening [[balance sheet]] and [[risk aversion]] of asset payoffs, extreme uncertainty aversion, and strategic or speculative behavior of liquid market participants. \n\nA \"balance sheet mechanism\" focuses on institutional features of financial markets. It provides an explanation for feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' balance sheets depend on asset prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock. Vayanos<ref>Vayanos, Dimitri (2004). \"Flight to Quality, Flight to Liquidity, and the Pricing of Risk>\" NBER Working Paper.</ref> models how a relationship between fund managers and clients can lead to effective risk aversion when illiquidity risk rises due to asset price volatility. He and Krishnamurthy<ref>He, Zhiguo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"A Model of Capital and Crises.\" Working Paper, Northwestern University.</ref> introduce [[principal\u2013agent problem]] to a model to show how specialists\u2019 capital investments are pro-cyclical. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2008) \"Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity.\" Review of Financial Studies, 22(6), 2201-2238.</ref> model [[margin requirement]] and show how volatility of asset prices tightens the requirement that lead to asset sales.\n\nAn \"information amplification mechanism\" focuses on a role of investor's extreme uncertainty aversion. When an unusual and unexpected event incurs losses, investors find that they do not have a good understanding about the tail outcome that they are facing and treat the risk as [[Knightian uncertainty]].<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> An example is [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008. Investors realized that they did not have good understanding about [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] which were newly adopted. Newly adopted financial innovation meant that market participants had only a short time to formulate valuation, and did not have enough history to refer to in their risk management and hedging models. Under Knightian uncertainty, investors respond by disengaging from risky activities and hoarding liquidity while reevaluating their investment models. They only take conservative approaches, investing on only safe and uncontingent claims, to protect themselves from worst-case scenarios related to the risk that they do not understand, which further deteriorates asset prices and financial market.\n\nA model of strategic or speculative behaviors of liquid investors provides another mechanism that explains flight-to-quality phenomenon. Acharya ''et al''<ref>Acharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \"Imperfect Competition in the Inter\u2010Bank Market for Liquidity.\" Working Paper, London Business School.</ref> show that during financial turmoil liquid banks in interbank loan markets do not lend their liquidity to illiquid banks, nor hoard liquidity for precautionary reasons, but, rather, hoard them to purchase assets at distress prices. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2005) \"Predatory Trading.\" The Journal of Finance, 60(4), 1825-1863.</ref> study strategic behaviors of liquid traders when they know that other traders need to liquidate their positions. The study shows that the strategic behaviors would lead to predatory pricing, which would lead the price of risky and illiquid assets to fall further than they would if price were based on risk consideration alone.\n\n==Empirical Studies==\nSince flight-to-quality phenomenon implies a shift in investing behavior towards some safe group of assets from risky assets, efforts to find evidence on flight-to-quality have been concentrated on analyzing widening yields or quantity changes between two assets. A number of studies find stronger negative association between stock and bond markets during a financial turmoil. Flight-to-quality is also observable within a safe group of assets. Longstaff<ref>Longstaff, Francis (2004) \"The Flight\u2010to\u2010Liquidity Premium in US Treasury Bond Prices.\" The Journal of Business, 77(3):511\u2010526.</ref> finds a spread between [[Resolution Funding Corporation]] bonds, whose liabilities are guaranteed by Treasury, and US Treasury bonds increases when consumer confidence drops, money market mutual funds and Treasury buy backs increase. Krishnamurthy compares on-the-run and off-the-run treasury bonds to find higher spreads on off-the \u2013run bonds are associated with higher spread between commercial paper and Treasury bonds. Beber ''et al''<ref>Beber, Alessandro, Michael Brandt, and Kenneth A. Kavajecz (2009), Flight-to-quality or Flight-to-liquidity? Evidence from the Euro-area bond market, Review of Financial Studies 22, 925-957.</ref> make explicit distinction between flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity and find relative importance of liquidity over credit quality rises during flight-to-quality episodes. Gatev and Strahan <ref>Gatev, Evan and Philip Strahan (2006). \"Banks' Advantage in Hedging Liquidity Risk: Theory and Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market.\" ''The Journal of Finance'', 61(2):867\u2010892.</ref> find that the spread between treasury bills and high grade [[commercial paper]] increases, banks tend to experience inflow of deposits and decreased cost of funding. This suggests that banks tend to be seen as [[:wikt:safe haven|safe havens]] in periods of turmoil. However, data shows that during 1998 the flight-to-quality episodes worsening relative position of banks compared to the very safe assets.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" ''Journal of Finance'' 63, 2195-2230.</ref>\n\n==Real sector effects==\nDuring a flight-to-quality episode [[external financing]] becomes harder for lower quality borrowers or riskier projects. Investors faced with tightened balance sheet and increased risk and uncertainty aversion reduce their investment and shift their portfolio only towards safer projects and high quality borrowers.\nTightening external financing for lower quality borrowers may extend to real consequences of output loss and higher unemployment, therefore exacerbate business cycle. A series of studies show that amount and composition of firm's external financing from bank loans are countercyclical during flight-to quality periods. Kashyap ''et al'' <ref>Kashyap, Anil, Jeremy Stein, and David Wilcox (1993).\"Monetary Policy and Credit Conditions: Evidence from the Composition of External Finance.\" American Economic Review, 83(1), 78\u201098.</ref> finds that quantity of commercial paper issuances of high quality firms increase relative to bank loans. Since lower quality firms lack external financing ability via commercial paper issuance, lower quality firms are likely to be deprived from financial resources. Gertler and Gilchrist<ref>Gertler, Mark and Simon Gilchrist (1994), \"Monetary Policy, Business Cycles, and the Behavior of Small Manufacturing Firms.\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics,109(2), 309-340.</ref> find similar result of relative proportion of loans being increased to larger firms, and Oliner and Rudebusch <ref>Oliner, Stephen and Glenn Rudebusch (1995).\u201cIs There a Bank Lending Channel for Monetary Policy?\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Review 2, 3\u201320.</ref> find new loans made to safer projects are countercyclical during flight-to-quality episodes.

It has an excellent natural harbor, the possession and control of which became a ''[[casus belli]]'' of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305). Japanese and then [[Russia]]n administration was established in 1895 and continued until 1905 when control was ceded to Japan. During that period, it was world-famous and was more significant than the other port on the peninsula, Dalian proper. In Western diplomatic, news, and historical writings, it was known as Port Arthur, and during the period when the Japanese controlled and administered the Liaodong (formerly Liaotung) Peninsula it was called {{Nihongo|2=\u65c5\u9806|3=Ryojun}}, the [[Japanese phonology|Japanese]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese characters]] in the city's name. After the Japanese defeat in [[World War II]], the city was under the administration of the [[Soviet Union]], which rented the port from China, until 1950. Although the Russians presented the port to China in 1950, Soviet troops remained in the city until 1955.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Dalian, China, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-08-03.jpg|thumb|left|Dalian and vicinities, [[Landsat 5]] satellite image, 2010-08-03]]\nCentral [[Dalian]] is some {{convert|64|km|0|abbr=off}} farther up the coast, sprawling around the narrowest neck of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] ({{zh|s=\u8fbd\u4e1c\u534a\u5c9b|t=\u907c\u6771\u534a\u5cf6|p=Li\u00e1od\u014dng B\u00e0nd\u01ceo}}), whereas L\u00fcshun occupies its southern tip.

Following Japan's defeat of Chinese troops at [[Pyongyang]] in Korea in September 1894, the Japanese First and Second Armies converged on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] by land and sea. Japanese war planners, ambitious for control of the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur and also cognizant of that port's strategic position controlling the northern [[Yellow Sea]] routes and the passage to [[Tianjin]], were determined to seize it.\n\nFollowing only token resistance during the day and night of November 20\u201321, 1894, Japanese troops entered the city on the morning of November 21. Several Western newspaper correspondents present at the time related the widespread massacre of Chinese inhabitants of the city by the victorious Japanese troops, apparently in response to the murderous treatment the Chinese had shown Japanese [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at Pyongyang and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Foremost among the correspondents was [[James Creelman]] of the ''[[New York World]]''.  Though at least one [[United States|American]] correspondent present completely contradicted Creelman's account,{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} there is \"little doubt\" that the Japanese troops \"indiscriminately killed\" thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians,<ref>Chushichi Tzusuki, ''The Pursuit of Power in Modern Japan 1825\u20131995'', OUP, 2003 (reprint of 2000 ed), p. 128</ref> and the story of a Japanese massacre soon spread among the Western public, damaging Japan's public image and the movement in the [[United States]] to renegotiate the [[unequal treaties]] between that country and Japan.  The event came to be known as the [[Port Arthur massacre (1894)|Port Arthur massacre]].\n\nAn account of a US sailor who visited the port in the weeks prior to the attack commented that the Chinese soldiers were \"ridiculous\".

He stated that at the time, the garrison numbered approximately 20,000 soldiers, but from his estimation, it should have had between 30,000 and 40,000 men stationed there.

As part of the terms of the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] concluding the war, Japan was granted the Liaodong Peninsula but had to cede the territory when threatened jointly with war by [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]] in what is called the [[Triple Intervention]] of 1895. This was seen as a [[Treaty of Shimonoseki#Conclusion|great humiliation]] in Japan.\n\nTwo years later, Russia coerced a [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|lease of the Liaodong Peninsula]] from China and gained railroad right-of-way to join the Liaodong Peninsula to the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] with a line running from Port Arthur and nearby Dalny ([[Dalian]]) to the Chinese city of [[Harbin]] (see [[Kwantung Leased Territory]]), and systematically began to fortify the town and harbor at Port Arthur. This railway from Port Arthur to Harbin became a southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway (not to be confused with the [[South Manchurian Railway]], the name of a company that undertook its management during the later Japanese period after 1905). Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] believed this acquisition of a Pacific port would enhance Russian security, and extend its economic influence. He was also falsely informed that the British were considering seizing the port.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sebag Montefiore |first=Simon |date=2016 |title=The Romanovs |url= |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |pages=503\u2013504|isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> All this was an additional goad to an already seething Japan. It was a hard lesson in international geopolitics Japan would not soon forget.\n\nThe Russian town of Dalny (Dalien/[[Dalian]]) was undeveloped in this era prior to 1898 when the Russian Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] founded the town of Dalny (sometimes Dalney). In 1902, the Russian viceroy de-emphasized Dalny (building a palace and cultural edifices instead at Port Arthur), except as a commercial port while continuing the development of manufacturing.\n\n=== Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) ===\nTen years later, Port Arthur again played a central role in war in the [[Far East]]. After the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1900\u201301) had been extinguished by an international coalition of troops, Russia refused to withdraw its reinforcements from [[Manchuria]] and instead began to fortify and garrison the entire route along the Southern Manchurian Railway. With this development, Japan proposed the two powers meet and discuss their respective roles in eastern Manchuria, as the area was considered being in their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].  Talks were conducted between 1902 and 1904. While numerous proposals and agreement papers were generated between the two powers, Russia continued the [[de facto]] annexation of territory through fortification and garrison, if not ''[[de jure]]''; while employing [[Timewasting|stalling]] tactics in its negotiations. In the end, with over two years of intensive [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] negotiations having gotten nowhere in clarifying each country's rights, prerogatives, and interests in inner Manchuria, Japan declared [[Russo-Japanese War|war on Russia in February 1904]].\n\n====The Battle of Port Arthur====\n[[File:Shinohara Kiyooki - 1904 - A Righteous War to Chastise the Russians The Destroyer Force's Night Attack (Ch\u00f4 Ro gisen, kichiku tai yash\u00fb).jpg|right|thumb|A Japanese [[propaganda]] [[Block printing|block print]] of the [[Battle of Port Arthur|night attack]] on Port Arthur by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]].]]\nThe [[Battle of Port Arthur]], the opening battle of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], was fought in the heavily fortified harbor of the town of Port Arthur/L\u00fcshun on 9 February 1904 when the Japanese attacked at night with torpedoes, followed by a brief daylight skirmish by major surface combatants.\n\nBy the end of July 1904, the Japanese army had pushed down the Liaodong peninsula and was at the outer defenses of Port Arthur. The fact that Japanese forces had closed to within artillery range of the harbor in early August 1904 led directly to the naval [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] which solidified Japan's command of the sea, where her fleets continued to blockade the harbor. Virtually all the battles of the war until July 1904 were strategic battles for territorial gain or position leading to the [[investment (military)|investment]] and [[siege]] of the port city.\n\nThe port eventually fell 2 January 1905 after a long train of battles on land and sea during which the Japanese occupied the whole of the [[Korean Peninsula]], split the Russian Army, devastated the Russian Fleet, and cut off the source of supplies on the railway from [[Harbin]], culminating in the bloody battle known as the [[Siege of Port Arthur]] (June\u2013January; some sources place the siege start in late July, a technical difference due to definitions).\n\n==After World War II==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-6654394-nj-51-5th-ed.jpg|thumb|Map including Port Arthur (labeled as L\u00dc-SHUN (PORT ARTHUR)) and surrounding region (1967)]]\nThe Japanese-controlled Ryojun City had 40 districts. The Chinese L\u00fcshun City was established on November 25, 1945 to replace Ryojun. The city was a subdivision of a larger L\u00fcda City and contained 40 villages in 3 districts: Dazhong ({{zh|s=\u5927\u4f17\u533a |t=\u5927\u773e\u5340|labels=no}}), Wenhua ({{zh|c=\u6587\u5316|labels=no}}), and Guangming ({{zh|c=\u5149\u660e|labels=no}}). In January 1946, Wenhua was merged into Dazhong, and the 40 villages were reduced to 23 communes ({{zh|c=[[wikt:\u574a|\u574a]]|labels=no}}). In January 1948, the remaining two districts were merged into one: Shinei ({{zh|s=\u5e02\u5185\u533a |t=\u5e02\u5167\u5340|labels=no}}), with 12 communes.\n\nOn January 7, 1960, L\u00fcshun City was renamed L\u00fcshunkou District, still under L\u00fcda. In 1981, L\u00fcda was renamed [[Dalian]], with L\u00fcshunkou remaining a constituent district.

It has an excellent natural harbor, the possession and control of which became a ''[[casus belli]]'' of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305). Japanese and then [[Russia]]n administration was established in 1895 and continued until 1905 when control was ceded to Japan. During that period, it was world-famous and was more significant than the other port on the peninsula, Dalian proper. In Western diplomatic, news, and historical writings, it was known as Port Arthur, and during the period when the Japanese controlled and administered the Liaodong (formerly Liaotung) Peninsula it was called {{Nihongo|2=\u65c5\u9806|3=Ryojun}}, the [[Japanese phonology|Japanese]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese characters]] in the city's name. After the Japanese defeat in [[World War II]], the city was under the administration of the [[Soviet Union]], which rented the port from China, until 1950. Although the Russians presented the port to China in 1950, Soviet troops remained in the city until 1955.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Dalian, China, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-08-03.jpg|thumb|left|Dalian and vicinities, [[Landsat 5]] satellite image, 2010-08-03]]\nCentral [[Dalian]] is some {{convert|64|km|0|abbr=off}} farther up the coast, sprawling around the narrowest neck of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] ({{zh|s=\u8fbd\u4e1c\u534a\u5c9b|t=\u907c\u6771\u534a\u5cf6|p=Li\u00e1od\u014dng B\u00e0nd\u01ceo}}), whereas L\u00fcshun occupies its southern tip.

Following Japan's defeat of Chinese troops at [[Pyongyang]] in Korea in September 1894, the Japanese First and Second Armies converged on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] by land and sea. Japanese war planners, ambitious for control of the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur and also cognizant of that port's strategic position controlling the northern [[Yellow Sea]] routes and the passage to [[Tianjin]], were determined to seize it.\n\nFollowing only token resistance during the day and night of November 20\u201321, 1894, Japanese troops entered the city on the morning of November 21. Several Western newspaper correspondents present at the time related the widespread massacre of Chinese inhabitants of the city by the victorious Japanese troops, apparently in response to the murderous treatment the Chinese had shown Japanese [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at Pyongyang and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Foremost among the correspondents was [[James Creelman]] of the ''[[New York World]]''.  Though at least one [[United States|American]] correspondent present completely contradicted Creelman's account,{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} there is \"little doubt\" that the Japanese troops \"indiscriminately killed\" thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians,<ref>Chushichi Tzusuki, ''The Pursuit of Power in Modern Japan 1825\u20131995'', OUP, 2003 (reprint of 2000 ed), p. 128</ref> and the story of a Japanese massacre soon spread among the Western public, damaging Japan's public image and the movement in the [[United States]] to renegotiate the [[unequal treaties]] between that country and Japan.  The event came to be known as the [[Port Arthur massacre (1894)|Port Arthur massacre]].\n\nAn account of a US sailor who visited the port in the weeks prior to the attack commented that the Chinese soldiers were \"ridiculous\". They lacked any semblance of military bearing, their dress was unkempt and untidy, and they wandered about the place with little in the way of direction or smartness associated with professional soldiers. He stated that at the time, the garrison numbered approximately 20,000 soldiers, but from his estimation, it should have had between 30,000 and 40,000 men stationed there. He opined that the Japanese could have taken the port with one third of its force, but that against disciplined soldiers, the place should have been impenetrable.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiLnvcc_gAkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=dragon#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Under the dragon flag: My experiences in the Chino-Japanese war |author=James Allen |year=1898 |publisher=Frederick A.

As part of the terms of the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] concluding the war, Japan was granted the Liaodong Peninsula but had to cede the territory when threatened jointly with war by [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]] in what is called the [[Triple Intervention]] of 1895. This was seen as a [[Treaty of Shimonoseki#Conclusion|great humiliation]] in Japan.\n\nTwo years later, Russia coerced a [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|lease of the Liaodong Peninsula]] from China and gained railroad right-of-way to join the Liaodong Peninsula to the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] with a line running from Port Arthur and nearby Dalny ([[Dalian]]) to the Chinese city of [[Harbin]] (see [[Kwantung Leased Territory]]), and systematically began to fortify the town and harbor at Port Arthur. This railway from Port Arthur to Harbin became a southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway (not to be confused with the [[South Manchurian Railway]], the name of a company that undertook its management during the later Japanese period after 1905). Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] believed this acquisition of a Pacific port would enhance Russian security, and extend its economic influence. He was also falsely informed that the British were considering seizing the port.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sebag Montefiore |first=Simon |date=2016 |title=The Romanovs |url= |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |pages=503\u2013504|isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> All this was an additional goad to an already seething Japan. It was a hard lesson in international geopolitics Japan would not soon forget.\n\nThe Russian town of Dalny (Dalien/[[Dalian]]) was undeveloped in this era prior to 1898 when the Russian Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] founded the town of Dalny (sometimes Dalney). In 1902, the Russian viceroy de-emphasized Dalny (building a palace and cultural edifices instead at Port Arthur), except as a commercial port while continuing the development of manufacturing.\n\n=== Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) ===\nTen years later, Port Arthur again played a central role in war in the [[Far East]]. After the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1900\u201301) had been extinguished by an international coalition of troops, Russia refused to withdraw its reinforcements from [[Manchuria]] and instead began to fortify and garrison the entire route along the Southern Manchurian Railway. With this development, Japan proposed the two powers meet and discuss their respective roles in eastern Manchuria, as the area was considered being in their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].  Talks were conducted between 1902 and 1904. While numerous proposals and agreement papers were generated between the two powers, Russia continued the [[de facto]] annexation of territory through fortification and garrison, if not ''[[de jure]]''; while employing [[Timewasting|stalling]] tactics in its negotiations. In the end, with over two years of intensive [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] negotiations having gotten nowhere in clarifying each country's rights, prerogatives, and interests in inner Manchuria, Japan declared [[Russo-Japanese War|war on Russia in February 1904]].\n\n====The Battle of Port Arthur====\n[[File:Shinohara Kiyooki - 1904 - A Righteous War to Chastise the Russians The Destroyer Force's Night Attack (Ch\u00f4 Ro gisen, kichiku tai yash\u00fb).jpg|right|thumb|A Japanese [[propaganda]] [[Block printing|block print]] of the [[Battle of Port Arthur|night attack]] on Port Arthur by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]].]]\nThe [[Battle of Port Arthur]], the opening battle of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], was fought in the heavily fortified harbor of the town of Port Arthur/L\u00fcshun on 9 February 1904 when the Japanese attacked at night with torpedoes, followed by a brief daylight skirmish by major surface combatants.\n\nBy the end of July 1904, the Japanese army had pushed down the Liaodong peninsula and was at the outer defenses of Port Arthur. The fact that Japanese forces had closed to within artillery range of the harbor in early August 1904 led directly to the naval [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] which solidified Japan's command of the sea, where her fleets continued to blockade the harbor. Virtually all the battles of the war until July 1904 were strategic battles for territorial gain or position leading to the [[investment (military)|investment]] and [[siege]] of the port city.\n\nThe port eventually fell 2 January 1905 after a long train of battles on land and sea during which the Japanese occupied the whole of the [[Korean Peninsula]], split the Russian Army, devastated the Russian Fleet, and cut off the source of supplies on the railway from [[Harbin]], culminating in the bloody battle known as the [[Siege of Port Arthur]] (June\u2013January; some sources place the siege start in late July, a technical difference due to definitions).\n\n==After World War II==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-6654394-nj-51-5th-ed.jpg|thumb|Map including Port Arthur (labeled as L\u00dc-SHUN (PORT ARTHUR)) and surrounding region (1967)]]\nThe Japanese-controlled Ryojun City had 40 districts. The Chinese L\u00fcshun City was established on November 25, 1945 to replace Ryojun. The city was a subdivision of a larger L\u00fcda City and contained 40 villages in 3 districts: Dazhong ({{zh|s=\u5927\u4f17\u533a |t=\u5927\u773e\u5340|labels=no}}), Wenhua ({{zh|c=\u6587\u5316|labels=no}}), and Guangming ({{zh|c=\u5149\u660e|labels=no}}). In January 1946, Wenhua was merged into Dazhong, and the 40 villages were reduced to 23 communes ({{zh|c=[[wikt:\u574a|\u574a]]|labels=no}}). In January 1948, the remaining two districts were merged into one: Shinei ({{zh|s=\u5e02\u5185\u533a |t=\u5e02\u5167\u5340|labels=no}}), with 12 communes.\n\nOn January 7, 1960, L\u00fcshun City was renamed L\u00fcshunkou District, still under L\u00fcda. In 1981, L\u00fcda was renamed [[Dalian]], with L\u00fcshunkou remaining a constituent district. In 1985, 7 of L\u00fcshunkou's 9 townships were upgraded to towns.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nL\u00fcshunkou District administers 9 [[Subdistrict (China)|subdistricts]]; all of the former towns were either abolished, merged or converted into subdistricts themselves.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2018/21/02/210212.html\n| script-title=zh:2018\u5e74\u7edf\u8ba1\u7528\u533a\u5212\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u57ce\u4e61\u5212\u5206\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\u65c5\u987a\u53e3\u533a\n| publisher  = National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China\n| language   = Chinese\n| accessdate = 2019-01-31}}</ref> <!--Jiangxi Subdistrict contains the {{convert|20.38|km\u00b2}} provincial L\u00fcshun Special Economic Zone established in 1992.-->\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Dengfeng Subdistrict]] (\u767b\u5cf0\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Desheng Subdistrict, Dalian|Desheng Subdistrict]] (\u5f97\u80dc\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Shuishiying Subdistrict]] (\u6c34\u5e08\u8425\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Longwangtang Subdistrict]] (\u9f99\u738b\u5858\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Tieshan Subdistrict, Dalian|Tieshan Subdistrict]] (\u94c1\u5c71\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Shuangdaowan Subdistrict]] (\u53cc\u5c9b\u6e7e\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Sanjianpu Subdistrict]] (\u4e09\u6da7\u5821\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Changcheng Subdistrict, Dalian|Changcheng Subdistrict]] (\u957f\u57ce\u8857\u9053)\n*[[Longtou Subdistrict]] (\u9f99\u5934\u8857\u9053)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Today==\nThe district's southern half along [[Lushun South Road|L\u00fcshun South Road]], central L\u00fcshun and the Naval Port zone continue to be off-limits to foreigners, although L\u00fcshunkou District is thoroughly modernized.

North of the Park were established the L\u00fcshun Development Zone, and L\u00fcshun New Port (on Yangtou Bay) where the railroad ferry across the [[Yellow Sea]] to [[Yantai]] is being planned.\n\nThe universities in downtown Dalian are being relocated to L\u00fcshunkou. [[Dalian Jiaotong University]] (formerly Dalian Railroad University) moved its Software School to the area near the new port, and [[Dalian University of Foreign Languages]] and [[Dalian Medical University]] relocated their main campuses to the eastern slope of Baiying Mountain, on L\u00fcshun South Road. [[Dalian Fisheries University]] is in the process of moving its English and Japanese language schools to Daheishi, on L\u00fcshun North Road.

It is the fourth oldest university in the country, founded in [[1889]] as [[college]] of the University of Chile.\n\n== History ==\n===Origins===\n[[File:TumbaDomeyko.JPG|thumb|left|Ignacio Domeyko, a Chilean-Polish scientist and professor at the National Institute of Chile, was the first intellectual to point out the need for an institution dedicated to the science of pedagogy.]]\n[[Ignacio Domeyko]], scientist and professor of the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|National Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], manifests for the first time -during one year of 1842- the need to change the education system in [[Chile]], inspired by the models that are being implemented in [[Europe]] where it was starting to develop a new science: pedagogy. At that time, Domeyko was a young immigrant in the university lessons around his homeland, particularly in [[Paris]], [[France]], he gave a lot of knowledge that was not limited to the natural sciences, if it was not an innovation in ideas for the organization that did not find education in this country, and that motivated him to start a slow but significant intellectual work.\n\nThe proposal of the Polish-nationalized Chilean teacher was that a [[normal school]] was created similar to the one he had known by the hand of the French philosopher Victor Cousin. In this project, use a dozen of the laws that were granted from the liberal government of Francisco Antonio Pinto and Diaz de la Puente to the National Institute in 1829, students from all over the country, settle in a special department of the prominent lyceum for two years, reviewing the studies that have already been taught in their schools, and then specialize in the area they are most interested in for another two years at the university.\n\n[[Diego Barros Arana]], philosopher and historian, assumes the rector of the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|National Institute]] between 1863 and 1872. Noticing from the outset the lack of preparation of Chilean teaching staff, he also realized that even under the direction of this institution, which had the best national teachers (among them the professors Amun\u00e1tegui, Vendel-Heyl, Lobeck, Pizarro) 14, the teaching was rough and did not have the didactics that he considered necessary. In this period, he would create a failed Teachers' Association.\n\nMany intellectuals were educated by this eminent historian (who before becoming rector, was professor since 1838 in which he is also his alma mater) among which Valent\u00edn Letelier, the main intellectual manager of the Pedagogical Institute, who would be strongly moved with the way of educating Arana, who never stopped visiting the classrooms or the students, concerned at all times not to be a simple minister of faith in charge of certifying a certain event, but to excite, interest and guide the intelligences educated.\n\nIts creation was firmly defended by numerous statesmen and teachers, among whom Don Valent\u00edn Letelier distinguished himself, who defended the Pedagogical with so much integrity that he even affirmed that suppressing it is making it impossible to train Chilean professors; is to make us perpetual tributaries of foreign pedagogy. Especially influenced by the aforementioned experience he had with Barros Arana during his basic studies:\n<blockquote>\"In Chile it is generally believed that any engineer can be a good teacher of mathematics, that every doctor is competent in the natural sciences, and that the teaching of the humanities is put in good hands when entrusted to lawyers. This is a very serious error because the most proper thing to assess the suitability of a teacher is not his knowledge, it is his didactics.\"</blockquote>\n[[File:BibliotecaIN.JPG|thumb|The Pedagogical Institute of Chile (now UMCE) was initially thought of as an independent department attached to the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|National Institute of Chile]].]]\nManuel Montt would try to take up Domeyko's original idea of annexing the hypothetical Pedagogical Institute to the National Institute, which would award 20 scholarships for aspiring professors, but in doing so it would be inevitable to absorb the old establishment for the new one, as had happened before when the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] disarmed the entire building and academic body of the [[Royal University of San Felipe]] in 1813, so the idea was discarded.\n\n===The Pedagogical Institute===\nIn 1888, during the government of the liberal president [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]], the Minister of Justice, Worship and Public Instruction (equivalent to the current Ministry of Education) Federico Puga Borne - as well as Letelier, a former institute and former student of Professor Arana - builds the formation decree of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile, which safeguarded the budget that allowed to give life to the project after 40 years of waiting. The sum was forty thousand Chilean pesos, and was signed the following year by the new minister Julio Ba\u00f1ados Espinosa on April 29, 1889.\n\nMinister Ba\u00f1ados contacted [[Valent\u00edn Letelier]] and Claudio Matte, who were members of the Chilean delegation in Germany between 1883 and 1885 where they studied the German education system (Matte served as a translator for Letelier, since he was the only one who handled the German language) to implement it in the institution. Later, the future teachers would be precisely Germans.\n\nThe pedagogical was born as a boarding school, free of charge and with the obligation to provide housing, food and board to the fellows. Education was divided into two axes: humanities and sciences. Humanities was separated into four courses: Castilian / Latin, French / Greek, English / German and History / Geography. While science would be divided into mathematics and natural sciences.\n\nLetelier knew how to channel and cement the aspirations in an establishment of international renown that took the name of Institute, since it was created under the auspices of the prestigious University of Chile, but with a modern constitution that favored research and teaching in topics related to the pedagogy, as it was used in European universities and institutes such as the Institute for Political Studies in Paris or the Colleges of Cambridge University. This model served as an example not only in Chile, where the University of Concepci\u00f3n highlighted with a department of teacher training created in 1919 with the same guidelines of El peda, but also in Latin America. They would be pioneers in pedagogical training in the continent. The work of the Pedagogical Institute was so important that about 80% of Chilean teachers were trained in these classrooms, coming to be considered one of the most prestigious teacher training centers in America. Numerous Pedagogical Missions were destined to form new Pedagogical Centers in other countries like Venezuela and Costa Rica.\n\n===First Academic Group===\n[[File:Pedag\u00f3gico.png|thumb|left|The Pedagogical Institute]]\nMinister Puga commissioned for the first time in 1888 the ambassador of [[Chile]] in [[Berlin]], Domingo Gana Cruz, six professors of higher education: one of philosophy, one of history and geography, one third of philology, one quarter of mathematics, one fifth of physical sciences and a last of natural sciences. Thus, the ambassador understood that his future depended on the pedagogical, which for the founders of the institution, was ideal.\n\nA select group of German teachers with extensive experience was hired who with exclusive dedication could create their chairs and dedicate themselves to research, the first academic body of the Pedagogical Institute was constituted by a Chilean, Enrique Nercasseau and Mor\u00e1n, and by the German professors:\n\n*Augusto Tafelmacher, professor of mathematics, graduated from the well-known [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], published more than twenty studies in the Annals of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Leipzig and the Annals of the [[University of Chile]] on mathematics, educational methods and Fermat's theorem, fact particularly remarkable since in these years nobody had written about mathematics in Chile.\n*Jorge Enrique Schneider (pedagogy, philosophy, logic, methodology, moral and philosophy of science). German that since adolescence that manifested his vocation. He studied Philosophy and Zoology at the [[University of Jena]] and then Pedagogy at the [[University of Leipzig]]. Known also for founding the Liceo de Aplicacion as a small academy for young people of middle and upper class and that was dependent on the Pedagogical Institute.\n*Federico Albert Botanist, paleontologist and ornithologist, professor of natural sciences. Son of a merchant from L\u00fcbeck. He received his doctorate at the University of Strasbourg with a dissertation called The Commodity Metric Art. In 1883 he received the title to teach and already in Chile was a collaborator of the Annals of the [[University of Chile]].\n*Hans Steffen (history and geography). The youngest academic in the Germanic group, and that however, according to Baron Richthroten, professor at the [[Berlin University]] of Young Steffen, \"in the art of teaching, was superior to his peers who had long years of experience \"\n*Federico Hanssen (philology, general grammar, linguistics, Latin, Greek, French, English, German, rhetoric and literary history).\n*Reinaldo Von Lilienthal (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and mechanics, who spent a few months in Chile and returned to Germany, where he stood out as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time and was replaced by Augusto Tafelmacher, who practiced until 1907) .\n*Federico Johow, notable botanist, who was appointed as the first director of the Pedagogical Institute (natural sciences, biology, zoology, botany and hygiene); nephew of a jurisconsult of the same name who was minister in the Supreme Court of Prussia. In 1880 he received the title of [[PhD]] in Philosophy and in 1882 the faculty of docenti, that is, the certification to practice university teaching. He was also assistant at the Botanical Institute of the [[University of Bonn]], in 1883 he was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences of Berlin to study the Antilles and sectors of Venezuela. Professor Johow had published and continued to publish in the Gazette of Botany of Leipzig, in the Annals of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin and others, including later the Annals of the University of Chile.\n*Rodolfo Lenz (grammar). He taught the \"living languages\", studied almost all the Neo-Latin dialects, Old French, Modern, Provencal, Italian, Spanish, Gothic, Old and Modern German, Old Saxon, English, Arabic, Greek, Russian and Latin. Today in the current UMCE there is bibliographic material from the 19th century and early twentieth century of original authors in a library that bears his name (Historical Library of the Pedagogical Institute \"Rodolfo Lenz).\n*Alfredo Beutell (chemistry and mineralogy). doctor of philosophy in 1879 and facultas docenti in 1885, assistant of the Laboratory of Chemistry of the [[University of Breslau]] and of the [[University of Greifswald]]. Important public studies on the chemical composition and optical properties of feldspars, on the precision pipette, on the water torch, on the spontaneous vial valve, etc.\n\nMost of the teachers who came to the old Pedagogical Institute did so, in part, due to the large number of European war conflicts and the exhaustive anti-Semitic persecution. On this, the famous Chilean philosopher [[Carla Cordua]] remembers her first year at the Ricardo Cumming Street house in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>We had, due to the [[National Socialist]] racial persecution in Europe, many very prominent and famous Jewish professors, who came to Spanish-America, many to [[Argentina]], others arrived to [[Chile]], and in that sense, their misfortune was our luck, because We had fabulous teachers, completely exceptional for the general level of Chilean university studies. (...) these people were completely exceptional, and had been scammed from Europe, particularly in Germany, but also in other countries that are anti-Semitic to this day.</blockquote>\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nDespite the insistence of Letelier in leaving the Pedagogical to the wing of the Faculty of Philosophy and Humanities of the University of Chile, only at the end of 1890 the house of studies accepted this request by order of the Council of Public Instruction. This fact is extremely important for the consolidation of the university status that still preserves the pedagogical profession. Until the end of the 19th century teachers had been trained very precariously in the Normal Schools of Chile. The management of the Institute was handed over to the German Fr Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow18 and his first generation of professors graduated in 1896.\n[[File:ZPEDAGOGICO.jpg|thumb|right|First students of the Liceo de Aplicacion, and its first professors, in the center of photography is Jorge Enrique Schneider, a German professor who came to Chile to be part of the first academic body of the university.|244x244px]]\n[[File:Fachada_Cumming_29_en_1920.jpg|thumb|right|Facade of the Lyceum of Application in Cumming Street in the year 1920, located next to the house that was the first headquarters of the Pedagogical Institute until 1949.|244x244px]]\n\n==== Liceo de Aplicaci\u00f3n ====\nThe minister of public instruction of Jorge Montt's government, Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Rosas, issued the supreme decree No. 1554 creating the Application Lyceum, attached to the Pedagogical Institute, which began operating on March 28, 1892, with the objective of giving a space for new teachers to practice their skills with a select group of middle and upper class students from Santiago:\n\n<blockquote>\"(...) whose vacancies are disputed every year by hundreds of parents\"</blockquote>\n\nThe first rector of this annexed establishment was the German professor of philology, philosophy and pedagogy (graduated from the University of Jena and Leipzig), Mr. Jorge Enrique Schneider, who had installed the idea of the [[Liceo de Aplicaci\u00f3n]] in a report delivered on October 10. 1890 to the Council of Professors of Chile with the support of the director of the Pedagogical Institute, the also German, [[Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow]].\n\nThe first classes of the lyceum were made in a small room located in Manuel Rodriguez street, and had the particularity that they taught subjects not taught in the pedagogical such as gymnastics, singing and drawing until the success of the project increased the initial enrollment of a couple of dozens to more than 100 students per year forced to buy an installation attached to the mansion of the Cumming house. Being so close to the central house of the Pedagogical Institute further improved its educational quality and prestige, positioning it at the level of such prestigious schools as the General National Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera or the School of the Sacred Hearts of Santiago.\n\n====Growth and social movements of the early twentieth century====\nThe creation of the Institute increased the enrollment of the University of Chile considerably. 15% of the enrolled (of a total 1056 for the year 1901) were future teachers, in 1900 there were 210 enrolled and in 1917 the number increased to almost 600. Of the 1098 students housed the pedagogical in 1921 , more than half were women, becoming the first instance of massive female entry to the university in the country. This increase also meant difficulties, since the old mansion of Cumming with Alameda, which also housed a small number of students from the Lyceum of Application, could not cope and the rooms soon became insufficient. The lack of was such that even the Peda, being saturated, sporadically received students from the School of Pharmacy and the Dental School, belonging to the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, the politics of Chile - and the world - would be confronted with new ideologies and movements that would surpass the traditional political parties completely. In this sense, the university student movement took a greater maturity to understand and deal with the issues that stressed the Chilean conflict, and that the possibility of [[socialism]] came to power for the first time in national history. The students at that time showed their disagreement with the prevailing political and social system and strongly supported the workers' movement. The [[Student Federation of the University of Chile]], which was relatively new, was composed mainly of students of the Pedagogical Institute among which Rudecindo Ortega, Jos\u00e9 Domingo G\u00f3mez Rojas, Pedro Le\u00f3n Loyola, [[Pablo de Rokha]], [[Juan G\u00f3mez Millas]] (who would end disappointed) of the left and socialism, years later would form the Nationalist Union Party of Chile, a fascist movement) and above all, [[Eugenio Gonz\u00e1lez Rojas]], philosophy student who came to preside over the FECH between 1922 and 1923 and was Minister of Education of the Republic Socialist of Chile (this former student also founded the Federation of Secondary Students of Santiago during his stay at the National General Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera). Years later, Gonz\u00e1lez travels to Venezuela to create the Pedagogical Institute of Caracas. Upon returning he is appointed Director of the Pedagogical and later Rector of the University of Chile\n\n===Pioneers in Psychological Research===\n[[File:BibliothecaAlbertina_Leipzig.jpg|left|thumb|The [[University of Leipzig]] was the first to create an experimental laboratory of psychology and inspired professors Mann and Schneider to create the first university simile in Chile under the tutelage of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] himself.]]\nWith the twentieth century, [[Experimental Psychology]] began in Chile. This had a magnificent boom thanks to professors Guillermo Mann and J.E. Schnider who created the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, which inaugurated the experimental movement in the country. Although, since 1889 both professors were teaching psychology, it was not until 1908 that Mann was appointed to buy modern instruments and bibliographical material in [[Europe]], establishing in a solid manner the laboratory that aimed to have the characteristics that [[Wilhelm Wundt]] used in his [[University of Leipzig]]. This would be the first psychology laboratory in a Chilean university institution21 and Wundt himself would have oriented the two teachers to the selection of instruments. While most of the instruments came from Leipzig, there was also a considerable amount of material purchased in Berlin, Paris and Milan.\n\nDespite the good performance of this initiative, the lack of state funding (it stopped being subsidized in 1917) meant its early closure. Today, part of the laboratory survives in the Department of Psychology of the current Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Chile. About these Guillermo Mann declared in a report to the Rector Valent\u00edn Letelier:\n\n<blockquote>The office of the instruments destined for psychological research can not be other than that of fixing of an exact and measurable physical conditions relations with the psychological processes that are being studied (...) We can distinguish between the methods of the psychological experiment the categories : first, methods of stimulation. Second, methods of measuring the time of psychic processes. Third, methods of determining the expressions or manifestations of these processes. And fourth, methods of measuring physical phenomena, related to psychic facts indirectly</blockquote>\n\nMann's laboratory was reopened by Luis A. Tirapegui, a psychologist at Columbia University, who wanted to promote the advances of experimental psychology along the lines of his predecessor, the field of education and pedagogical initiatives such as the adaptation of the Binet-Terman scale to the Chilean context.20\n\nThis reopening encouraged other universities to create their own versions of the Pedagogical Laboratory, such as the Psychotechnology Laboratory of the University of Concepci\u00f3n, whose material was similar to the original. A laboratory was also born in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Normal School of Copiap\u00f3 with which there were several intellectual clashes in which the liberal and conservative positions of each other clashed.\n\n==Faculty==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is the fourth oldest university in the country, founded in [[1889]] as [[college]] of the University of Chile.\n\n== History ==\n===Origins===\n[[File:TumbaDomeyko.JPG|thumb|left|Ignacio Domeyko, a Chilean-Polish scientist and professor at the National Institute of Chile, was the first intellectual to point out the need for an institution dedicated to the science of pedagogy.]]\n[[Ignacio Domeyko]], scientist and professor of the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera| National Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], manifests for the first time -during one year of 1842- the need to change the education system in [[Chile]], inspired by the models that are being implemented in [[Europe]] where it was starting to develop a new science: pedagogy. At that time, Domeyko was a young immigrant in the university lessons around his homeland, particularly in [[Paris]], [[France]], he gave a lot of knowledge that was not limited to the natural sciences, if it was not an innovation in ideas for the organization that did not find education in this country, and that motivated him to start a slow but significant intellectual work.\n\nThe proposal of the Polish-nationalized Chilean teacher was that a [[normal school]] was created similar to the one he had known by the hand of the French philosopher Victor Cousin. In this project, use a dozen of the laws that were granted from the liberal government of Francisco Antonio Pinto and Diaz de la Puente to the National Institute in 1829, students from all over the country, settle in a special department of the prominent lyceum for two years, reviewing the studies that have already been taught in their schools, and then specialize in the area they are most interested in for another two years at the university.\n\n[[Diego Barros Arana]], philosopher and historian, assumes the rector of the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|National Institute]] between 1863 and 1872. Noticing from the outset the lack of preparation of Chilean teaching staff, he also realized that even under the direction of this institution, which had the best national teachers (among them the professors Amun\u00e1tegui, Vendel-Heyl, Lobeck, Pizarro) 14, the teaching was rough and did not have the didactics that he considered necessary. In this period, he would create a failed Teachers' Association.\n\nMany intellectuals were educated by this eminent historian (who before becoming rector, was professor since 1838 in which he is also his alma mater) among which Valent\u00edn Letelier, the main intellectual manager of the Pedagogical Institute, who would be strongly moved with the way of educating Arana, who never stopped visiting the classrooms or the students, concerned at all times not to be a simple minister of faith in charge of certifying a certain event, but to excite, interest and guide the intelligences educated.\n\nIts creation was firmly defended by numerous statesmen and teachers, among whom Don Valent\u00edn Letelier distinguished himself, who defended the Pedagogical with so much integrity that he even affirmed that suppressing it is making it impossible to train Chilean professors; is to make us perpetual tributaries of foreign pedagogy. Especially influenced by the aforementioned experience he had with Barros Arana during his basic studies:\n<blockquote>\"In Chile it is generally believed that any engineer can be a good teacher of mathematics, that every doctor is competent in the natural sciences, and that the teaching of the humanities is put in good hands when entrusted to lawyers. This is a very serious error because the most proper thing to assess the suitability of a teacher is not his knowledge, it is his didactics.\"</blockquote>\n[[File:BibliotecaIN.JPG|thumb|The Pedagogical Institute of Chile (now UMCE) was initially thought of as an independent department attached to the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|National Institute of Chile]].]]\nManuel Montt would try to take up Domeyko's original idea of annexing the hypothetical Pedagogical Institute to the National Institute, which would award 20 scholarships for aspiring professors, but in doing so it would be inevitable to absorb the old establishment for the new one, as had happened before when the [[Instituto Nacional General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] disarmed the entire building and academic body of the [[Royal University of San Felipe]] in 1813, so the idea was discarded.\n\n===The Pedagogical Institute===\nIn 1888, during the government of the liberal president [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]], the Minister of Justice, Worship and Public Instruction (equivalent to the current Ministry of Education) Federico Puga Borne - as well as Letelier, a former institute and former student of Professor Arana - builds the formation decree of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile, which safeguarded the budget that allowed to give life to the project after 40 years of waiting. The sum was forty thousand Chilean pesos, and was signed the following year by the new minister Julio Ba\u00f1ados Espinosa on April 29, 1889.\n\nMinister Ba\u00f1ados contacted [[Valent\u00edn Letelier]] and Claudio Matte, who were members of the Chilean delegation in Germany between 1883 and 1885 where they studied the German education system (Matte served as a translator for Letelier, since he was the only one who handled the German language) to implement it in the institution. Later, the future teachers would be precisely Germans.\n\nThe pedagogical was born as a boarding school, free of charge and with the obligation to provide housing, food and board to the fellows. Education was divided into two axes: humanities and sciences. Humanities was separated into four courses: Castilian / Latin, French / Greek, English / German and History / Geography. While science would be divided into mathematics and natural sciences.\n\nLetelier knew how to channel and cement the aspirations in an establishment of international renown that took the name of Institute, since it was created under the auspices of the prestigious University of Chile, but with a modern constitution that favored research and teaching in topics related to the pedagogy, as it was used in European universities and institutes such as the Institute for Political Studies in Paris or the Colleges of Cambridge University. This model served as an example not only in Chile, where the University of Concepci\u00f3n highlighted with a department of teacher training created in 1919 with the same guidelines of El peda, but also in Latin America. They would be pioneers in pedagogical training in the continent. The work of the Pedagogical Institute was so important that about 80% of Chilean teachers were trained in these classrooms, coming to be considered one of the most prestigious teacher training centers in America. Numerous Pedagogical Missions were destined to form new Pedagogical Centers in other countries like Venezuela and Costa Rica.\n===First Academic Group===\n[[File:Pedag\u00f3gico.png|thumb|left|The Pedagogical Institute]]\nMinister Puga commissioned for the first time in 1888 the ambassador of [[Chile]] in [[Berlin]], Domingo Gana Cruz, six professors of higher education: one of philosophy, one of history and geography, one third of philology, one quarter of mathematics, one fifth of physical sciences and a last of natural sciences. Thus, the ambassador understood that his future depended on the pedagogical, which for the founders of the institution, was ideal.\n\nA select group of German teachers with extensive experience was hired who with exclusive dedication could create their chairs and dedicate themselves to research, the first academic body of the Pedagogical Institute was constituted by a Chilean, Enrique Nercasseau and Mor\u00e1n, and by the German professors:\n\n*Augusto Tafelmacher, professor of mathematics, graduated from the well-known [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], published more than twenty studies in the Annals of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Leipzig and the Annals of the [[University of Chile]] on mathematics, educational methods and Fermat's theorem, fact particularly remarkable since in these years nobody had written about mathematics in Chile.\n\n*Jorge Enrique Schneider (pedagogy, philosophy, logic, methodology, moral and philosophy of science). German that since adolescence that manifested his vocation. He studied Philosophy and Zoology at the [[University of Jena]] and then Pedagogy at the [[University of Leipzig]]. Known also for founding the Liceo de Aplicacion as a small academy for young people of middle and upper class and that was dependent on the Pedagogical Institute.\n\n*Federico Albert Botanist, paleontologist and ornithologist, professor of natural sciences. Son of a merchant from L\u00fcbeck. He received his doctorate at the University of Strasbourg with a dissertation called The Commodity Metric Art. In 1883 he received the title to teach and already in Chile was a collaborator of the Annals of the [[University of Chile]].\n\n*Hans Steffen (history and geography). The youngest academic in the Germanic group, and that however, according to Baron Richthroten, professor at the [[Berlin University]] of Young Steffen, \"in the art of teaching, was superior to his peers who had long years of experience \"\n\n*Federico Hanssen (philology, general grammar, linguistics, Latin, Greek, French, English, German, rhetoric and literary history).\n\n*Reinaldo Von Lilienthal (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and mechanics, who spent a few months in Chile and returned to Germany, where he stood out as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time and was replaced by Augusto Tafelmacher, who practiced until 1907) .\n\n*Federico Johow, notable botanist, who was appointed as the first director of the Pedagogical Institute (natural sciences, biology, zoology, botany and hygiene); nephew of a jurisconsult of the same name who was minister in the Supreme Court of Prussia. In 1880 he received the title of [[PhD]] in Philosophy and in 1882 the faculty of docenti, that is, the certification to practice university teaching. He was also assistant at the Botanical Institute of the [[University of Bonn]], in 1883 he was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences of Berlin to study the Antilles and sectors of Venezuela. Professor Johow had published and continued to publish in the Gazette of Botany of Leipzig, in the Annals of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin and others, including later the Annals of the University of Chile.\n\n*Rodolfo Lenz (grammar). He taught the \"living languages\", studied almost all the Neo-Latin dialects, Old French, Modern, Provencal, Italian, Spanish, Gothic, Old and Modern German, Old Saxon, English, Arabic, Greek, Russian and Latin. Today in the current UMCE there is bibliographic material from the 19th century and early twentieth century of original authors in a library that bears his name (Historical Library of the Pedagogical Institute \"Rodolfo Lenz).\n\n*Alfredo Beutell (chemistry and mineralogy). doctor of philosophy in 1879 and facultas docenti in 1885, assistant of the Laboratory of Chemistry of the [[University of Breslau]] and of the [[University of Greifswald]]. Important public studies on the chemical composition and optical properties of feldspars, on the precision pipette, on the water torch, on the spontaneous vial valve, etc.\n\nMost of the teachers who came to the old Pedagogical Institute did so, in part, due to the large number of European war conflicts and the exhaustive anti-Semitic persecution. On this, the famous Chilean philosopher [[Carla Cordua]] remembers her first year at the Ricardo Cumming Street house in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>We had, due to the [[National Socialist]] racial persecution in Europe, many very prominent and famous Jewish professors, who came to Spanish-America, many to [[Argentina]], others arrived to [[Chile]], and in that sense, their misfortune was our luck, because We had fabulous teachers, completely exceptional for the general level of Chilean university studies. (...) these people were completely exceptional, and had been scammed from Europe, particularly in Germany, but also in other countries that are anti-Semitic to this day.</blockquote>\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nDespite the insistence of Letelier in leaving the Pedagogical to the wing of the Faculty of Philosophy and Humanities of the University of Chile, only at the end of 1890 the house of studies accepted this request by order of the Council of Public Instruction. This fact is extremely important for the consolidation of the university status that still preserves the pedagogical profession. Until the end of the 19th century teachers had been trained very precariously in the Normal Schools of Chile. The management of the Institute was handed over to the German Fr Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow18 and his first generation of professors graduated in 1896.\n[[File:ZPEDAGOGICO.jpg|thumb|right|First students of the Liceo de Aplicacion, and its first professors, in the center of photography is Jorge Enrique Schneider, a German professor who came to Chile to be part of the first academic body of the university.|244x244px]]\n[[File:Fachada_Cumming_29_en_1920.jpg|thumb|right|Facade of the Lyceum of Application in Cumming Street in the year 1920, located next to the house that was the first headquarters of the Pedagogical Institute until 1949.|244x244px]]\n==== Liceo de Aplicaci\u00f3n ====\nThe minister of public instruction of Jorge Montt's government, Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Rosas, issued the supreme decree No. 1554 creating the Application Lyceum, attached to the Pedagogical Institute, which began operating on March 28, 1892, with the objective of giving a space for new teachers to practice their skills with a select group of middle and upper class students from Santiago:\n\n<blockquote>\"(...) whose vacancies are disputed every year by hundreds of parents\"</blockquote>\n\nThe first rector of this annexed establishment was the German professor of philology, philosophy and pedagogy (graduated from the University of Jena and Leipzig), Mr. Jorge Enrique Schneider, who had installed the idea of the [[Liceo de Aplicaci\u00f3n]] in a report delivered on October 10. 1890 to the Council of Professors of Chile with the support of the director of the Pedagogical Institute, the also German, [[Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow]].\n\nThe first classes of the lyceum were made in a small room located in Manuel Rodriguez street, and had the particularity that they taught subjects not taught in the pedagogical such as gymnastics, singing and drawing until the success of the project increased the initial enrollment of a couple of dozens to more than 100 students per year forced to buy an installation attached to the mansion of the Cumming house. Being so close to the central house of the Pedagogical Institute further improved its educational quality and prestige, positioning it at the level of such prestigious schools as the General National Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera or the School of the Sacred Hearts of Santiago.\n\n====Growth and social movements of the early twentieth century====\nThe creation of the Institute increased the enrollment of the University of Chile considerably. 15% of the enrolled (of a total 1056 for the year 1901) were future teachers, in 1900 there were 210 enrolled and in 1917 the number increased to almost 600. Of the 1098 students housed the pedagogical in 1921 , more than half were women, becoming the first instance of massive female entry to the university in the country. This increase also meant difficulties, since the old mansion of Cumming with Alameda, which also housed a small number of students from the Lyceum of Application, could not cope and the rooms soon became insufficient. The lack of was such that even the Peda, being saturated, sporadically received students from the School of Pharmacy and the Dental School, belonging to the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, the politics of Chile - and the world - would be confronted with new ideologies and movements that would surpass the traditional political parties completely. In this sense, the university student movement took a greater maturity to understand and deal with the issues that stressed the Chilean conflict, and that the possibility of [[socialism]] came to power for the first time in national history. The students at that time showed their disagreement with the prevailing political and social system and strongly supported the workers' movement. The [[Student Federation of the University of Chile]], which was relatively new, was composed mainly of students of the Pedagogical Institute among which Rudecindo Ortega, Jos\u00e9 Domingo G\u00f3mez Rojas, Pedro Le\u00f3n Loyola, [[Pablo de Rokha]], [[Juan G\u00f3mez Millas]] (who would end disappointed) of the left and socialism, years later would form the Nationalist Union Party of Chile, a fascist movement) and above all, [[Eugenio Gonz\u00e1lez Rojas]], philosophy student who came to preside over the FECH between 1922 and 1923 and was Minister of Education of the Republic Socialist of Chile (this former student also founded the Federation of Secondary Students of Santiago during his stay at the National General Institute Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera). Years later, Gonz\u00e1lez travels to Venezuela to create the Pedagogical Institute of Caracas. Upon returning he is appointed Director of the Pedagogical and later Rector of the University of Chile\n\n===Pioneers in Psychological Research===\n[[File:BibliothecaAlbertina_Leipzig.jpg|left|thumb|The [[University of Leipzig]] was the first to create an experimental laboratory of psychology and inspired professors Mann and Schneider to create the first university simile in Chile under the tutelage of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] himself.]]\nWith the twentieth century, [[Experimental Psychology]] began in Chile. This had a magnificent boom thanks to professors Guillermo Mann and J.E. Schnider who created the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, which inaugurated the experimental movement in the country. Although, since 1889 both professors were teaching psychology, it was not until 1908 that Mann was appointed to buy modern instruments and bibliographical material in [[Europe]], establishing in a solid manner the laboratory that aimed to have the characteristics that [[Wilhelm Wundt]] used in his [[University of Leipzig]]. This would be the first psychology laboratory in a Chilean university institution21 and Wundt himself would have oriented the two teachers to the selection of instruments. While most of the instruments came from Leipzig, there was also a considerable amount of material purchased in Berlin, Paris and Milan.\n\nDespite the good performance of this initiative, the lack of state funding (it stopped being subsidized in 1917) meant its early closure. Today, part of the laboratory survives in the Department of Psychology of the current Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Chile. About these Guillermo Mann declared in a report to the Rector Valent\u00edn Letelier:\n\n<blockquote>The office of the instruments destined for psychological research can not be other than that of fixing of an exact and measurable physical conditions relations with the psychological processes that are being studied (...) We can distinguish between the methods of the psychological experiment the categories : first, methods of stimulation. Second, methods of measuring the time of psychic processes. Third, methods of determining the expressions or manifestations of these processes. And fourth, methods of measuring physical phenomena, related to psychic facts indirectly</blockquote>\n\nMann's laboratory was reopened by Luis A. Tirapegui, a psychologist at Columbia University, who wanted to promote the advances of experimental psychology along the lines of his predecessor, the field of education and pedagogical initiatives such as the adaptation of the Binet-Terman scale to the Chilean context.20\n\nThis reopening encouraged other universities to create their own versions of the Pedagogical Laboratory, such as the Psychotechnology Laboratory of the University of Concepci\u00f3n, whose material was similar to the original. A laboratory was also born in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Normal School of Copiap\u00f3 with which there were several intellectual clashes in which the liberal and conservative positions of each other clashed.\n==Faculty==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are precepts established since the founding of Kingswood School by the Reverend John Wesley, England, in 1748, during the Industrial Revolution.[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles]\n\n== Organic Institutions ==\nThe Methodist University of Angola is composed by six faculties and four master's programs.\n\n=== Faculty of Architecture ===\n\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Architecture and Urbanism]\n\n=== Faculty of Engineering ===\n\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Computer Engineering]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Mechatronics Engineering]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Civil Engineering]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Industrial Engineering and Electrical Systems]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Environmental Engineering]\n\n=== Faculty of Economic and Business Sciences ===\n\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Business Management and Administration]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Economy]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Environment and Territory Management]\n\n=== Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences ===\n\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Portuguese Language and Communication]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Tourism and Hotel Management]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Psychology]\n*Philosophy\n\n=== [http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Law School] ===\n\n=== Faculty of Health Sciences and Sports ===\n\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Clinical Analyzes and Public Health]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Physiotherapy]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Cardiopneumology]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Nursing]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Sport Sciences and Education]\n*[http://uma.co.ao/Home/Ingles Biology]\n\n=== Faculty of Theology ===\n\n* Theology\n\n=== Master's Degrees ===\n\n* Accounting and Auditing\n* Applied Economics and Management\n* Economics and Territory Management\n* Environmental Management\n\n=== Doctorates ===\n\n* Theology\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n# Health and Sports Campus in Cacuaco;\n# Kinaxixi Campus in Luanda.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|http://www.uma.co.ao/}}\n\n{{Universities in Angola}}\n{{Luanda}}\n{{coord missing|Angola}}\n\n[[Category:Universities in Angola]]\n[[Category:Schools in Luanda]]\n[[Category:Methodist universities and colleges|Angola]]\n[[Category:Protestantism in Angola]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Angola]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2007]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control, addedunderlinkedtag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_University_of_Angola"}

In the early [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907), the Dalian region was part of [[Andong]] Prefecture in Jili state; during the [[Liao Dynasty]] (916\u20131125), it was part of Dong Jing Tong Liaoyang county. Dalian was named Sanshan in the period of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] (220\u2013420), San Shanpu in the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907), Sanshan Seaport in the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), and Qingniwakou during the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644\u20131911).\n\n===Qing Dynasty===\nIn the 1880s, Jinzhou, the north of downtown within Dalian, now [[Jinzhou District]], was a walled town and centre for political intrigue and economic activity. The Qing government built bridges and heavily fortified the peninsula. Mining camps on the northern coast of [[Dalian Bay]] became the small town of Qingniwa or [[Qingniwaqiao]], near what became downtown Dalian.\n\n===British, Russian, and Japanese occupations===\n\n{{Main|Russian Dalian|Kwantung Leased Territory}}\n[[File:Dairen Oohiroba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zhongshan Square (Dalian)|Zhongshan Square]], then \u014chiroba (\u5927\u5e83\u5834), ca. 1940.

In April 1895, China conceded defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceding [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]], and making many other concessions in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]].\n\nThe [[Triple Intervention]] by Russia, France and Germany forced Japan to return the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to China, despite the treaty's terms; instead the [[Russian Empire]] coerced a lease of the peninsula from the Qing Dynasty in 1898. For Russia the region of the peninsula was of particular interest as one of the few areas in the region that had the potential to develop [[Port#Warm-water port|ice-free ports]].<ref>Hess, Christian A.

Major-General Baron [[Anatoly Stoessel]] defended the [[siege of Port Arthur]], for five months, but the Japanese army managed to sink several Russian ships attempting to relieve him through long-distance fire in early December. Admiral Eugene Alexeyeff was blamed for splitting precious resources shipped {{convert|5000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} across the single tracked Trans-Siberian Railway and [[Manchurian Railway]] between Dalniy and Port Arthur. After the Japanese navy crippled the remaining Russian battleship ''[[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|Sevastopol]]'' in three weeks of constant attacks, and explosives detonated in tunnels destroyed Port Arthur's remaining defenses at year's end, Russia surrendered the port on 2 January 1905. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] ceded Port Arthur to Japan, which set up the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] or ''Guandongzhou'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u95dc\u6771\u5dde}}), on roughly the southern half (Jinzhou District and south) of present-day Dalian. Japanese invested heavily in the region, which became the main trading port between Manchuria and Japan. Japan leased the area from [[Manchukuo]] after establishing the puppet state in 1932. In 1937, as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began, Japan enlarged and modernized the trade zone as two cities: the northern Dairen (Dalian) and the southern Ryojun (L\u00fcshun or Port Arthur).\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Joint Chinese-Soviet travel document issued at Da Lian (Guandong) in 1948.jpg|thumb|left|Joint Chinese-Soviet travel document issued at Dalian (Guandong) in 1948]]\n[[File:Txu-oclc-6614368-nj51-5.jpg|left|thumb|Dalian (labelled as TA-LIEN (DAIREN) {{lang|zh-hant|\u5927\u9023}}) (1956)]]\n[[File:China Railways SY in Dalian.JPG|thumb|A retired [[China Railways SY]], built jointly by [[CRRC Dalian|Dalian Locomotive Works]] and [[Tangshan Railway Vehicle|Tangshan Locomotive Works]] in 1959, on display in front of Dalian Modern Museum]]\nWith the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945, Dairen was passed to the Soviets, whose [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] had liberated the city. The Soviets and [[Chinese Communists]] cooperated to develop the city, relatively undamaged during the war,<ref name=\"shp\"/> especially its industrial infrastructure and the port. The Soviet government rented the port and in 1945 the first Chinese Communist mayor of the new L\u00fcda Administrative Office ({{zh|s=\u65c5\u5927\u884c\u653f\u516c\u7f72|labels=no}}) had been appointed. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 1950, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] presented the city to the Chinese Communist government without any compensation.

English sources called the city \"Dairen\" in this period, from the Japanese.\n\nIn 1950, Dalian merged with nearby town called [[L\u00fcshun]] ({{zh|s=\u65c5\u987a|links=no}}) (formerly \"Ryojun\" and before that, \"Port Arthur\") to form the city of '''L\u00fcda'''<ref name=\"shp\"/> ({{zh|c=\u65c5\u5927|hp=L\u01dad\u00e0|links=no}}), a name formed from the first syllable of each constituent's name which was usually rendered as '''Luta''' in English during that era. In 1981, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] again renamed the city, from L\u00fcda to \"Dalian\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u9023|s=\u5927\u8fde|hp=D\u00e0li\u00e1n|links=no}}, the same Chinese characters as Japanese ''Dairen''), effective 5 March 1981.<ref name=\"shp\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Ancient===\nIn the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] periods (221 BC\u2013AD 220), Chinese expanded their territories into northern [[Korea]] through the Dalian region, then under the jurisdiction of [[Liaodong]] county.<ref name=\"shp\"/> During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] era (3rd through 5th centuries), the kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] controlled this region. In the early [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907), the Dalian region was part of [[Andong]] Prefecture in Jili state; during the [[Liao Dynasty]] (916\u20131125), it was part of Dong Jing Tong Liaoyang county. Dalian was named Sanshan in the period of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] (220\u2013420), San Shanpu in the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907), Sanshan Seaport in the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), and Qingniwakou during the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644\u20131911).\n\n===Qing Dynasty===\nIn the 1880s, Jinzhou, the north of downtown within Dalian, now [[Jinzhou District]], was a walled town and centre for political intrigue and economic activity. The Qing government built bridges and heavily fortified the peninsula. Mining camps on the northern coast of [[Dalian Bay]] became the small town of Qingniwa or [[Qingniwaqiao]], near what became downtown Dalian.\n\n===British, Russian, and Japanese occupations===\n\n{{Main|Russian Dalian|Kwantung Leased Territory}}\n[[File:Dairen Oohiroba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zhongshan Square (Dalian)|Zhongshan Square]], then \u014chiroba (\u5927\u5e83\u5834), ca. 1940.

In April 1895, China conceded defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceding [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]], and making many other concessions in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]].\n\nThe [[Triple Intervention]] by Russia, France and Germany forced Japan to return the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to China, despite the treaty's terms; instead the [[Russian Empire]] coerced a lease of the peninsula from the Qing Dynasty in 1898. For Russia the region of the peninsula was of particular interest as one of the few areas in the region that had the potential to develop [[Port#Warm-water port|ice-free ports]].<ref>Hess, Christian A.

Admiral Eugene Alexeyeff was blamed for splitting precious resources shipped {{convert|5000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} across the single tracked Trans-Siberian Railway and [[Manchurian Railway]] between Dalniy and Port Arthur. After the Japanese navy crippled the remaining Russian battleship ''[[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|Sevastopol]]'' in three weeks of constant attacks, and explosives detonated in tunnels destroyed Port Arthur's remaining defenses at year's end, Russia surrendered the port on 2 January 1905. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] ceded Port Arthur to Japan, which set up the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] or ''Guandongzhou'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u95dc\u6771\u5dde}}), on roughly the southern half (Jinzhou District and south) of present-day Dalian. Japanese invested heavily in the region, which became the main trading port between Manchuria and Japan. Japan leased the area from [[Manchukuo]] after establishing the puppet state in 1932. In 1937, as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began, Japan enlarged and modernized the trade zone as two cities: the northern Dairen (Dalian) and the southern Ryojun (L\u00fcshun or Port Arthur).\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Joint Chinese-Soviet travel document issued at Da Lian (Guandong) in 1948.jpg|thumb|left|Joint Chinese-Soviet travel document issued at Dalian (Guandong) in 1948]]\n[[File:Txu-oclc-6614368-nj51-5.jpg|left|thumb|Dalian (labelled as TA-LIEN (DAIREN) {{lang|zh-hant|\u5927\u9023}}) (1956)]]\n[[File:China Railways SY in Dalian.JPG|thumb|A retired [[China Railways SY]], built jointly by [[CRRC Dalian|Dalian Locomotive Works]] and [[Tangshan Railway Vehicle|Tangshan Locomotive Works]] in 1959, on display in front of Dalian Modern Museum]]\nWith the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945, Dairen was passed to the Soviets, whose [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] had liberated the city.

With a coastline of {{convert|1906|km|abbr=on}}, it governs the majority of the Liaodong Peninsula and about 260 surrounding islands and reefs.

The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|\u22123.6|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|24.4|\u00b0C|1}} in August.

It lies on the banks of [[Sava|Sava river]] across from [[Croatia]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 83,516 inhabitants, while the city of Br\u010dko has a population of 39,893 inhabitants.\n\nBr\u010dko is the only entirely self-governing free city currently in existence in Europe.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/14/brcko-bosnia-europe-only-free-city Welcome to Br\u010dko, Europe\u2019s only free city and a law unto itself].</ref>\n\n==Name==\nIts name is very likely linked to the ''[[Breuci]]'' (Greek \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9), a subtribe of [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Pannonian tribes]] of the [[Illyrians]] who migrated to the vicinity of today's Br\u010dko from the territories of the [[Yamnaya culture]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Breuci greatly resisted the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] but were conquered in 1st century BC and a lot of them were sold as [[slaves]] after their defeat. They started receiving Roman citizenship during [[Trajan|Trajan's]] rule.\n\nA number of Breuci migrated and settled in [[Dacia]], where a town called [[Bre\u021bcu|Bereck or Bre\u021bcu]], a river ([[Bre\u021bcu River]]) and a mountain [[Mun\u021bii Bre\u021bcului]] in today's [[Romania]] were named after them.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1978 {{ISBN|963 05 1490 7}} 103. oldal '''Bereck'''-sz\u00f3cikk</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Brcko02.svg|thumb|200px|left|Br\u010dko District and Br\u010dko town]]\n\nThe city is located on the country's northern border, across the [[Sava|Sava River]] from [[Gunja (Croatia)|Gunja]] in Croatia.\n\nBr\u010dko is the seat of the ''[[Br\u010dko District]]'', an independent unit of local self-government created on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina following an arbitration process. The local administration was formerly supervised by an international supervisory regime headed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|Principal Deputy High Representative]] who is also ''[[ex officio]]'' the Br\u010dko [[International Supervisor for Br\u010dko|International Supervisor]]. This international supervision was frozen since 23 May 2012.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressb/default.asp?content_id=47197 |title=Press Conference Following the Meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace implementation Council |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Expand section|1=information beyond 1996-97 period|small=no|date=July 2017}}\n}}\nBr\u010dko was a geographic point of contention in 1996 when the U.S.-led [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) built Camp McGovern on the outskirts of the city. Camp McGovern under the overwatch of 3-5 CAV 1/BDE/1AR Division (US) commanded by LTC Anthony Cucculo was constructed from a war torn farming cooperative structure in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) for the purpose of establishing peacekeeping operations. The mission was to separate the forming warring factions. The ZOS was one kilometer wide of [[no man's land]], where special permission was required for Serbian or Bosnian forces to enter.  Various checkpoints and observation points (OP's) were established to control the separation.\n\nAlthough Br\u010dko was a focal point for tension in the late 1990s, considerable progress in multi-ethnic integration in Br\u010dko has since occurred including integration of secondary schooling. Reconstruction efforts and the Property Law Implementation Plan have improved the situation regarding property and return.\nToday, Br\u010dko has returned to a strategic transshipment point along the Sava River.  The population of Br\u010dko has not returned to its pre-war ethnic mix of Bosniacs, Serbs, and Croats. Br\u010dko sits at the east-west apex of Republika Srpska, the ethnic Serb portion of Bosnia & Herzegovina, and as such is critical to the RS for its economic future.\n\nBr\u010dko was one of the main points discussed in the [[Dayton Peace Accords]].  After several weeks of intensive negotiation, the issue of Br\u010dko was to be decided by international arbitration. Br\u010dko Arbitration ruled in May 1997 that Br\u010dko would be a special district managed by an ambassadorial representative from the international community. The first Ambassador to Br\u010dko was an American with support staff from the UK, Sweden, Denmark & France.\n\nThe first international organization to open office in Br\u010dko at that time was the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) headed by Randolph Hampton.\n\nFollowing [[Peace Implementation Council|PIC]] meeting on 23 May 2012, it was decided to suspend, not terminate, the mandate of Br\u010dko International Supervisor. Br\u010dko Arbitral Tribunal, together with the suspended Br\u010dko Supervision, will still continue to exist.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{{IPA-sh|br\u0329\u0302t\u0283ko\u02d0|pron}}) is a city and the administrative seat of [[Br\u010dko District]], in northern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It lies on the banks of [[Sava|Sava river]] across from [[Croatia]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 83,516 inhabitants, while the city of Br\u010dko has a population of 39,893 inhabitants.\n\nIt is the only existent entirely self-governing free city in Europe.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/14/brcko-bosnia-europe-only-free-city Welcome to Br\u010dko, Europe\u2019s only free city and a law unto itself].</ref>\n\n==Name==\nIts name is very likely linked to the ''[[Breuci]]'' (Greek \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9), a subtribe of [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Pannonian tribes]] of the [[Illyrians]] who migrated to the vicinity of today's Br\u010dko from the territories of the [[Yamnaya culture]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Breuci greatly resisted the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] but were conquered in 1st century BC and a lot of them were sold as [[slaves]] after their defeat. They started receiving Roman citizenship during [[Trajan|Trajan's]] rule.\n\nA number of Breuci migrated and settled in [[Dacia]], where a town called [[Bre\u021bcu|Bereck or Bre\u021bcu]], a river ([[Bre\u021bcu River]]) and a mountain [[Mun\u021bii Bre\u021bcului]] in today's [[Romania]] were named after them.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1978 {{ISBN|963 05 1490 7}} 103. oldal '''Bereck'''-sz\u00f3cikk</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Brcko02.svg|thumb|200px|left|Br\u010dko District and Br\u010dko town]]\n\nThe city is located on the country's northern border, across the [[Sava|Sava River]] from [[Gunja (Croatia)|Gunja]] in Croatia.\n\nBr\u010dko is the seat of the ''[[Br\u010dko District]]'', an independent unit of local self-government created on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina following an arbitration process. The local administration was formerly supervised by an international supervisory regime headed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|Principal Deputy High Representative]] who is also ''[[ex officio]]'' the Br\u010dko [[International Supervisor for Br\u010dko|International Supervisor]]. This international supervision was frozen since 23 May 2012.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressb/default.asp?content_id=47197 |title=Press Conference Following the Meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace implementation Council |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Expand section|1=information beyond 1996-97 period|small=no|date=July 2017}}\n}}\nBr\u010dko was a geographic point of contention in 1996 when the U.S.-led [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) built Camp McGovern on the outskirts of the city. Camp McGovern under the overwatch of 3-5 CAV 1/BDE/1AR Division (US) commanded by LTC Anthony Cucculo was constructed from a war torn farming cooperative structure in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) for the purpose of establishing peacekeeping operations. The mission was to separate the forming warring factions. The ZOS was one kilometer wide of [[no man's land]], where special permission was required for Serbian or Bosnian forces to enter.  Various checkpoints and observation points (OP's) were established to control the separation.\n\nAlthough Br\u010dko was a focal point for tension in the late 1990s, considerable progress in multi-ethnic integration in Br\u010dko has since occurred including integration of secondary schooling. Reconstruction efforts and the Property Law Implementation Plan have improved the situation regarding property and return.\nToday, Br\u010dko has returned to a strategic transshipment point along the Sava River.  The population of Br\u010dko has not returned to its pre-war ethnic mix of Bosniacs, Serbs, and Croats. Br\u010dko sits at the east-west apex of Republika Srpska, the ethnic Serb portion of Bosnia & Herzegovina, and as such is critical to the RS for its economic future.\n\nBr\u010dko was one of the main points discussed in the [[Dayton Peace Accords]].  After several weeks of intensive negotiation, the issue of Br\u010dko was to be decided by international arbitration. Br\u010dko Arbitration ruled in May 1997 that Br\u010dko would be a special district managed by an ambassadorial representative from the international community. The first Ambassador to Br\u010dko was an American with support staff from the UK, Sweden, Denmark & France.\n\nThe first international organization to open office in Br\u010dko at that time was the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) headed by Randolph Hampton.\n\nFollowing [[Peace Implementation Council|PIC]] meeting on 23 May 2012, it was decided to suspend, not terminate, the mandate of Br\u010dko International Supervisor. Br\u010dko Arbitral Tribunal, together with the suspended Br\u010dko Supervision, will still continue to exist.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Carver, Rev. Aggrey, Rev. Woods, Rev. McGarr, Rev. William (Bill) H. Spray, and Rev. E. Bernard Hall, who arrived in 1959 to be the last European missionary to serve as principal. In his final period of service in 1963, he stepped down to be deputy principal and servedg under Mr Kanu Achinivu, the first Nigerian-born principal of the college.\n\nIn recent history, the following men have served: Mr. Onokala, Mr. Anyaoha, Mr. Chukwu Ogbonnaya, Mr. Nwauche, Godwin O. O. Uzoechi, Mr C. N. Ukanwoke, Dr. Chukwumereije and Chief Sir Mike Emezue (D O B), who became the Principal of the College from 2008-2012.
