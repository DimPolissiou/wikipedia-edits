In [[Turkey]] there is an annual competition to find the country's best muezzin.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness/2013/03/20133413812851784.html |title= Muezzin |publisher= Aljazeera |date=13 March 2013 |access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, a muezzin would have recited the call to prayer atop the [[minaret]]s in order to be heard by those around the mosque. Now, mosques often have [[Loudspeakers in mosques|loudspeakers mounted on the top of the minaret]] and the muezzin will use a microphone, or a recording is played, allowing the call to prayer to be heard at great distances without climbing the minaret.\n\n==Origins==\nThe institution of the muezzin has existed since the time of [[Muhammad]]. The first muezzin was [[Bilal ibn Ribah]], who walked the streets to call the believers to come to prayer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John Henrik|title=African People in World History|year=1993|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9780933121775|page=30}}</ref> Although many of the customs associated with the muezzin remained undecided at the time of Muhammad's death, including which direction one should choose for the calling, where it should be performed, and the use of trumpets, flags or lamps, all of these are elements of the muezzin's role during the adhan.\n\nAfter minarets became customary at mosques, the office of muezzin in cities was sometimes given to a [[Blindness|blind]] man, who could not see down into the inner courtyards of the citizens' houses and thus could not violate privacy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Whether factual or not, the blindness of muezzin is claimed as almost universal at certain periods by Jose Saramago in his novel concerning historical epistemology, [[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Notable muezzins==\n* [[Bilal ibn Ribah| Bilal ibn Ribah al-Habashi]]\n* [[Rahim Moazzen Zadeh Ardabili]]\n* [[Ali Ahmed Mulla]]\n* [[Jamal Ahmed]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Salah]] or ''salat'', Muslim daily prayer\n* [[Adhan]], the Islamic call to prayer, recited by the muuezzin\n* [[Schulklopfer]], the Jewish equivalent of the muuezzin\n* [[Loudspeakers in mosques]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite journal\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Kl1COWj9ubAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA285&dq=Muezzin&ots=ZwpM50FY4p&sig=_CsgBvqQqCw_T-nAGDAi_yE3ciU&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Muezzin&f=false\n|title=On the Role of the Muezzin and the ''Muwaqqit'' in Medieval Islamic Society\n|author=David A.

Eunice was also featured in her eponymous CBS [[Eunice (film)|made-for-TV movie]], which aired in 1982.<ref>McLean, Robert A. (March 14, 1982). \"A New Special from Carol Burnett: Reprise of her popular 'Eunice' role strikes a universal chord\", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.</ref><ref>Shales, Tom (March 15, 1982). \"Too much 'Eunice'\", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. C11.</ref> The film starred Carol Burnett as Eunice; [[Ken Berry]] as Eunice's well-to-do brother, Philip (Berry played a different brother, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Vinton_Harper|Vinton]], on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series); [[Harvey Korman]] as Eunice's husband, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ed_Higgins|Ed Higgins]]; [[Betty White]] as Eunice's sister, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ellen_Harper|Ellen Harper-Jackson]]; [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Eunice's \"Mama\", [[Thelma Harper]]; and [[Dick Clair]] as the voice of Eunice's father, Carl Harper. The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Bubba_Higgins|Bubba]]'s high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving. However, especially on ''The Family'' sketches, Eunice was beaten down by her tyrannical, emotionally-abusive mother, and her fits of rage were usually provoked by her mother's passive-aggressive comments. Her character was portrayed as a jealous antagonist in her appearances on ''Mama's Family'', much more so than her appearances on ''The Family'' sketches. Carol Burnett has said that Eunice is her favorite character from her show.<ref>Findlay, Prentiss (February 8, 1998). \"Live show keeps edge on comedy\", ''[[The Post and Courier]]''.</ref> Burnett did not appear at all in the first-run syndication version of the show due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer, [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>  Also, as revealed in Vicki Lawrence's [[autobiography]], Burnett resented Lawrence for accepting the \"Mama\" role in first-run syndication, this being during her divorce from Hamilton. She held a grudge against Lawrence up until Hamilton's death in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball - Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> \nAccording to the original ''Carol Burnett Show'', Eunice had four brothers: Phillip ([[Roddy McDowall]]); Larry ([[Alan Alda]]); Jack ([[Tom Smothers]]); and, later, Ken Berry as Vinton; and one sister, Ellen ([[Betty White]]). Their [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Aunt_Fran_Crowley|Aunt Fran]] was played by [[Rue McClanahan]].\n\n==Creation and development==\nWriters [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]] created the Eunice character as part of a sketch the two would perform on TV variety shows in the 1960s.

Eunice was also featured in her eponymous CBS [[Eunice (film)|made-for-TV movie]], which aired in 1982.<ref>McLean, Robert A. (March 14, 1982). \"A New Special from Carol Burnett: Reprise of her popular 'Eunice' role strikes a universal chord\", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.</ref><ref>Shales, Tom (March 15, 1982). \"Too much 'Eunice'\", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. C11.</ref> The film starred Carol Burnett as Eunice; [[Ken Berry]] as Eunice's well-to-do brother, Philip (Berry played a different brother, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Vinton_Harper|Vinton]], on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series); [[Harvey Korman]] as Eunice's husband, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ed_Higgins|Ed Higgins]]; [[Betty White]] as Eunice's sister, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ellen_Harper|Ellen Harper-Jackson]]; [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Eunice's \"Mama\", [[Thelma Harper]]; and [[Dick Clair]] as the voice of Eunice's father, Carl Harper. The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son Bubba's high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving. However, especially on ''The Family'' sketches, Eunice was beaten down by her tyrannical, emotionally-abusive mother, and her fits of rage were usually provoked by her mother's passive-aggressive comments. Her character was portrayed as a jealous antagonist in her appearances on ''Mama's Family'', much more so than her appearances on ''The Family'' sketches. Carol Burnett has said that Eunice is her favorite character from her show.<ref>Findlay, Prentiss (February 8, 1998). \"Live show keeps edge on comedy\", ''[[The Post and Courier]]''.</ref> Burnett did not appear at all in the first-run syndication version of the show due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer, [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>  Also, as revealed in Vicki Lawrence's [[autobiography]], Burnett resented Lawrence for accepting the \"Mama\" role in first-run syndication, this being during her divorce from Hamilton. She held a grudge against Lawrence up until Hamilton's death in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball - Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> \nAccording to the original ''Carol Burnett Show'', Eunice had four brothers: Phillip ([[Roddy McDowall]]); Larry ([[Alan Alda]]); Jack ([[Tom Smothers]]); and, later, Ken Berry as Vinton; and one sister, Ellen ([[Betty White]]).

The latter project brought him to America when production was transferred from wartime Britain, and R\u00f3zsa remained in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1946.\n\nHis notable Hollywood career earned him considerable fame, earning 17 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations including three successes for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947), and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), while his concert works were championed by such major artists as [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], and [[J\u00e1nos Starker]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\nMikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa was born in [[Budapest]] and was introduced to classical and folk music by his mother, Regina, a [[pianist]] who had studied with pupils of [[Franz Liszt]], and his father, Gyula, a well-to-do industrialist and landowner who loved Hungarian [[folk music]]. \n\nR\u00f3zsa's maternal uncle Lajos, violinist with the Budapest Opera, presented young Mikl\u00f3s with his first instrument at the age of five. He later took up the [[viola]] and [[piano]]. By the age of eight he was performing in public and composing.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He also collected [[folksong]]s from the area where his family had a country estate north of Budapest in an area inhabited by the [[Pal\u00f3c]] Hungarians. While deeply admiring the folk-based nationalism of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], R\u00f3zsa sought to find his own way as a composer. Fearing that Kod\u00e1ly's dominance at the Budapest's [[Franz Liszt Academy]] tended to suppress individualism, he sought to study  music in Germany. He enrolled at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1925,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> ostensibly to study chemistry at the behest of his practical-minded father. Determined to become a composer, he transferred to the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] the following year. There he studied composition with [[Hermann Grabner]], successor to [[Max Reger]]. He also studied choral music with (and later assisted) [[Karl Straube]] at the [[Thomaskirche]], where [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] had once been the organist. R\u00f3zsa emerged from these years with a deep respect for the German musical tradition, which would always temper the Hungarian nationalism of his musical style.\n\nR\u00f3zsa's first two published works, the String Trio, Op. 1, and the Piano Quintet, Op. 2, were issued in Leipzig by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. In 1929, he received his diplomas ''cum laude''.<ref name=\"American Composers Orchestra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_rozsa.htm |title=David Raksin Remembers his Colleagues |publisher=American Composers Orchestra |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> During the Leipzig years he essayed a single-movement Violin Concerto and a lengthy Symphony, Op. 6. Neither work was published, and R\u00f3zsa was discouraged on a trip to Berlin when [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] did not find time to consider the Symphony. Rozsa suppressed both works, but eventually allowed the Symphony (minus its lost scherzo) to be recorded in 1993.\n\nFor a time he remained in Leipzig as Grabner's assistant, but at the suggestion of the French [[organist]] and composer [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]], he moved to Paris in 1931. There he composed chamber music and a ''Serenade'' for small orchestra, Op. 10 (later greatly revised as ''Hungarian Serenade'', Op. 25). It was premiered in Budapest by [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]], who had advised R\u00f3zsa to offer a shorter work than the Symphony. [[Richard Strauss]] was in the audience, and his approval meant more to the young composer than the presence of Habsburg royalty and the prince regent, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. The subsequent ''Theme, Variations, and Finale'', Op. 13, was especially well received and was performed by conductors such as [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Karl B\u00f6hm]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]].\n\n==Film scoring career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\nR\u00f3zsa was introduced to film music in 1934 by his friend, the Swiss composer [[Arthur Honegger]]. Following a concert which featured their respective compositions, Honegger mentioned that he supplemented his income as a composer of film scores, including the film ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (1934 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' (1934). R\u00f3zsa went to see it and was greatly impressed by the opportunities the film medium offered. However, no film scoring opportunities presented themselves in Paris, and R\u00f3zsa had to support himself by reliance on a wealthy patron and by composing light music under the pseudonym Nic Tomay. It was not until R\u00f3zsa moved to [[London]] that he was hired to compose his first film score for ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), produced by his fellow Hungarian [[Alexander Korda]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Around the same time he also scored ''[[Thunder in the City]]'' (1937) for another Hungarian filmmaker, [[\u00c1kos Tolnay]], who had previously urged R\u00f3zsa to come to England. While the latter film was the first to open, R\u00f3zsa always cited the more prestigious Korda project as his film debut. He joined the staff of Korda's [[London Films]], and scored the studio's epic ''[[The Four Feathers (1939 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Korda and the studio's music director, [[Muir Mathieson]], brought R\u00f3zsa onto their Arabian Nights fantasy ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940) when the operetta-style approach of the original composer, [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], was deemed unsuitable. Production was transferred to Hollywood when the war broke out, and Rozsa completed his score there in 1940.\n\nThe music earned him his first Academy Award nomination. While Korda remained in Hollywood, R\u00f3zsa was effectively the music director of his organization. In his capacity he supervised the scoring of ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942) and contributed at least one sequence of his own music. His own U.S. scores for Korda included ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'' (1940), ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' (1941), and ''[[Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book|The Jungle Book]]'' (1942). From the last of these emerged ''The Jungle Book Suite'' for narrator and orchestra, which became popular as narrated by the film's star, [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], and was soon recorded in New York by RCA. The 78-rpm album became the first substantial recording of Hollywood film music. It was later recorded with R\u00f3zsa conducting the Frankenland State Orchestra of Nuremberg and [[Leo Genn]] as narrator.\n\nIn 1943, now associated with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], R\u00f3zsa scored the first of several collaborations with director [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[Five Graves to Cairo]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That same year that he also scored the similarly themed [[Humphrey Bogart]] film ''[[Sahara (1943 American film)|Sahara]]''. In 1944, his scores for a second Wilder collaboration, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and for ''[[The Woman of the Town]]'', both received Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1944, R\u00f3zsa was hired by producer [[David O. Selznick]] to compose the score for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''. The scoring process was notably contentious, with producer, director, and composer all expressing considerable dissatisfaction with each other. Numerous changes were made in the editing by Audray Granville, Selznick's assistant and de facto music director. The almost farcical history or artists at cross-purposes has been documented by Jack Sullivan (''Hitchcock's Music'', 2006) and especially Nathan Platte (''Making Music in Selznick's Hollywood'', 2018). Nevertheless, the film, finally released in late 1945, was a hit, and the music became extraordinarily popular in its own right. The combination of lush melody for the romance and frenzied expressionism for the suspense scenes proved irresistible. R\u00f3zsa's pioneering (for Hollywood) use of the [[theremin]] contributed to the effect, and the attention it generated likely influenced his Academy Award nomination. Two of his other 1945 scores were also nominated, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' and ''[[A Song to Remember]]'', but the Oscar was awarded to ''Spellbound''. Although Selznick was unhappy with the score, his innovative radio promotion of the music contributed to both the film's and the composer's popularity. R\u00f3zsa eventually arranged his themes as the ''Spellbound Concerto'', which (in multiple versions) has enjoyed lasting success in concerts and recordings.\n\nR\u00f3zsa earned another Oscar nomination for scoring ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946) which introduced [[Burt Lancaster]] to film audiences.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Part of the famed theme for the ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'' radio and TV show duplicated part of Rozsa's ''The Killers'' main theme, and he successfully sued for damages, and subsequently was given co-credit for the ''Dragnet'' theme.\n\nR\u00f3zsa received his second Oscar for ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947), in which [[Ronald Colman]], as a Shakespearean actor playing Othello, becomes murderously disturbed in his offstage life. R\u00f3zsa later adopted the title for his own memoir, signifying his desire to keep his personal music distinct from his movie career. That same year R\u00f3zsa and [[Eugene Zador]] orchestrated music by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] for the film ''[[Song of Scheherazade]]'', about a fictional episode in the composer's life. R\u00f3zsa also wrote original music for the film. Also in 1947, he scored the music for the psychological thriller ''[[The Red House (film)|The Red House]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAmong other films scored by R\u00f3zsa during the 1940s were the prison drama ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947), also with Lancaster, and ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), the latter also including music by [[Frank Skinner (composer)|Frank Skinner]]. Both of those films were directed by [[Jules Dassin]].\n\n''[[Madame Bovary (1949 film)|Madame Bovary]]'' (1949) was R\u00f3zsa's first important score for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which produced most of the later films that he scored. Other popular scores that he composed for MGM pictures include ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951), ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1952), ''[[Plymouth Adventure]]'' (1952), ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1953), ''[[Green Fire]]'' (1954). ''[[Moonfleet (1955 film)|Moonfleet]]'' (1955),'' [[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), ''[[Lust for Life (1956 film)|Lust for Life]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961) and ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nFor ''Ben-Hur'', R\u00f3zsa received his third and final Oscar. His final two nominations (one each for Best Original Score and Best Original Song) were for the 1961 [[Samuel Bronston]] film ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]''.\n\nIn 1968, he was asked to score ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', after [[Elmer Bernstein]] turned it down due to his political beliefs. R\u00f3zsa initially declined the offer, saying, \"I don't do westerns.\"  However, he agreed to compose the score after being informed, \"It's not a Western, it's an 'Eastern'.\" He produced a strong and varied score, which included a nightclub vocal by a Vietnamese singer, B\u1ea1ch Y\u1ebfn. However, one cue which incorporated stanzas of \"[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]\" was deleted from the film's final edit.\n\nHis popular film scores during the 1970s included his last two Billy Wilder collaborations ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970) and ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), the [[Ray Harryhausen]] fantasy sequel ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973), the latter-day ''[[film noir]]'' ''[[Last Embrace]]'' starring [[Roy Scheider]], and the time-travel fantasy film ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' (1979) for which R\u00f3zsa won a Science Fiction Film Award, saying in his televised acceptance speech that of all the film scores he had ever composed, it was the one he had worked on the hardest.\n\nAfter completing work on the music for the spy thriller ''[[Eye of the Needle (film)|Eye of the Needle]]'' (1981), R\u00f3zsa's last film score was for the black-and-white [[Steve Martin]] film ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' (1982), a comic homage to the ''film noir'' films of the 1940s, a genre to which Rozsa himself had contributed scores.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Although R\u00f3zsa's career as a composer for films ended following a stroke he suffered while on holiday in Italy later that year, he continued to compose various concert pieces thereafter; one of his last works being Sonata for Ondes Martenot, op. 45 (1989).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pytheasmusic.org/rozsa.html |title=Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa (1907-1995) |publisher=Pytheas Center for Contemporary Music |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to California at the behest of his son, and remained sequestered at his home for the remainder of his life.\n\n==Death==\nR\u00f3zsa died on 27 July 1995,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and is buried at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_rozsa.htm |title=American Composers Orchestra - David Raksin Remembers His Colleagues |publisher=Americancomposers.org |date=1907-04-18 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> His wife, Margaret, died in 1999, aged 89.\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa}}\nR\u00f3zsa's first major success was the orchestral ''Theme, Variations, and Finale'', Op. 13, introduced in Duisburg, Germany, in 1934 and soon taken up by [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Karl B\u00f6hm]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Hans Swarowsky]], and other leading conductors.\n\nIt was first played in the United States by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Hans Lange]] on 28\u201329 October 1937, and achieved wide exposure through a 1943 New York Philharmonic concert broadcast when [[Leonard Bernstein]] made his famous conducting debut.\n\nBy 1952, his film score work was proving so successful that he was able to negotiate a clause in his contract with MGM that gave him three months each year away from the film studio so that he could focus on concert music.\n\nR\u00f3zsa's Violin Concerto, Op. 24, was composed in 1953\u201354 for the [[violin]]ist [[Jascha Heifetz]], who collaborated with the composer in fine-tuning it. R\u00f3zsa later adapted portions of this work for the score of [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970). R\u00f3zsa's Cello Concerto, Op. 32 was written much later (1967\u201368) at the request of the [[cellist]] [[J\u00e1nos Starker]], who premiered the work in Berlin in 1969.\n\nBetween his violin and cello concertos, R\u00f3zsa composed his Sinfonia Concertante, Op. 29, for violin, cello, and orchestra. The commissioning artists, Heifetz and his frequent collaborator [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], never performed the finished work, although they did record a reduced version of the slow movement, called ''Tema con Variazoni'', Op. 29a.\n\nR\u00f3zsa also received recognition for his choral works. His collaboration with conductor Maurice Skones and The Choir of the West at [[Pacific Lutheran University]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], resulted in a commercial recording of his sacred choral works\u2014''[[To Everything There is a Season]]'', Op. 20; ''[[The Vanities of Life]]'', Op. 30; and ''[[Psalm 23|The Twenty-Third Psalm]]'', Op. 34\u2014produced by John Steven Lasher and recorded by Allen Giles for the [[Entr'acte Recording Society]] in 1978.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe seventh variation (after the theme) of his \"Theme, Variations And Finale\", Op. 13, was used as part of the soundtrack in four episodes\u2014most notably \"The Clown Who Cried\"\u2014of 1950s television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''\"Quo Vadis?\" Film Music Notes,'' Vol. 11, No. 2 (1951)\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''Double Life: The Autobiography of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Composer in the Golden Years of Hollywood'', Seven Hills Books (1989) - {{ISBN|0-85936-209-4}}\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''Double Life: The Autobiography of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Composer in the Golden Years of Hollywood'', The Baton Press (1984) - {{ISBN|0-85936-141-1}} (Softcover edition)\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''\u00c9letem t\u00f6rt\u00e9neteib\u0151l'' (Discussions with [[J\u00e1nos Sebesty\u00e9n]], edited by Gy\u00f6rgy Lehotay-Horv\u00e1th).

The latter project brought him to America when production was transferred from wartime Britain, and R\u00f3zsa remained in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1946.\n\nHis notable Hollywood career earned him considerable fame, earning 17 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations including three successes for ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947), and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), while his concert works were championed by such major artists as [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], and [[J\u00e1nos Starker]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\nMikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa was born in [[Budapest]] and was introduced to classical and folk music by his mother, Regina, a [[pianist]] who had studied with pupils of [[Franz Liszt]], and his father, Gyula, a well-to-do industrialist and landowner who loved Hungarian [[folk music]]. \n\nR\u00f3zsa's maternal uncle Lajos, violinist with the Budapest Opera, presented young Mikl\u00f3s with his first instrument at the age of five. He later took up the [[viola]] and [[piano]]. By the age of eight he was performing in public and composing.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He also collected [[folksong]]s from the area where his family had a country estate north of Budapest in an area inhabited by the [[Pal\u00f3c]] Hungarians. While deeply admiring the folk-based nationalism of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], R\u00f3zsa sought to find his own way as a composer. Fearing that Kod\u00e1ly's dominance at the Budapest's [[Franz Liszt Academy]] tended to suppress individualism, he sought to study  music in Germany. He enrolled at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1925,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> ostensibly to study chemistry at the behest of his practical-minded father. Determined to become a composer, he transferred to the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] the following year. There he studied composition with [[Hermann Grabner]], successor to [[Max Reger]]. He also studied choral music with (and later assisted) [[Karl Straube]] at the [[Thomaskirche]], where [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] had once been the organist. R\u00f3zsa emerged from these years with a deep respect for the German musical tradition, which would always temper the Hungarian nationalism of his musical style.\n\nR\u00f3zsa's first two published works, the String Trio, Op. 1, and the Piano Quintet, Op. 2, were issued in Leipzig by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. In 1929, he received his diplomas ''cum laude''.<ref name=\"American Composers Orchestra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_rozsa.htm |title=David Raksin Remembers his Colleagues |publisher=American Composers Orchestra |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> During the Leipzig years he essayed a single-movement Violin Concerto and a lengthy Symphony, Op. 6. Neither work was published, and R\u00f3zsa was discouraged on a trip to Berlin when [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] did not find time to consider the Symphony. Rozsa suppressed both works, but eventually allowed the Symphony (minus its lost scherzo) to be recorded in 1993.\n\nFor a time he remained in Leipzig as Grabner's assistant, but at the suggestion of the French [[organist]] and composer [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]], he moved to Paris in 1931. There he composed chamber music and a ''Serenade'' for small orchestra, Op. 10 (later greatly revised as ''Hungarian Serenade'', Op. 25). It was premiered in Budapest by [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]], who had advised R\u00f3zsa to offer a shorter work than the Symphony. [[Richard Strauss]] was in the audience, and his approval meant more to the young composer than the presence of Habsburg royalty and the prince regent, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. The subsequent ''Theme, Variations, and Finale'', Op. 13, was especially well received and was performed by conductors such as [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Karl B\u00f6hm]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]].\n\n==Film scoring career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\nR\u00f3zsa was introduced to film music in 1934 by his friend, the Swiss composer [[Arthur Honegger]]. Following a concert which featured their respective compositions, Honegger mentioned that he supplemented his income as a composer of film scores, including the film ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (1934 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' (1934). R\u00f3zsa went to see it and was greatly impressed by the opportunities the film medium offered. However, no film scoring opportunities presented themselves in Paris, and R\u00f3zsa had to support himself by reliance on a wealthy patron and by composing light music under the pseudonym Nic Tomay. It was not until R\u00f3zsa moved to [[London]] that he was hired to compose his first film score for ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), produced by his fellow Hungarian [[Alexander Korda]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Around the same time he also scored ''[[Thunder in the City]]'' (1937) for another Hungarian filmmaker, [[\u00c1kos Tolnay]], who had previously urged R\u00f3zsa to come to England. While the latter film was the first to open, R\u00f3zsa always cited the more prestigious Korda project as his film debut. He joined the staff of Korda's [[London Films]], and scored the studio's epic ''[[The Four Feathers (1939 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Korda and the studio's music director, [[Muir Mathieson]], brought R\u00f3zsa onto their Arabian Nights fantasy ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940) when the operetta-style approach of the original composer, [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], was deemed unsuitable. Production was transferred to Hollywood when the war broke out, and Rozsa completed his score there in 1940.\n\nThe music earned him his first Academy Award nomination. While Korda remained in Hollywood, R\u00f3zsa was effectively the music director of his organization. In his capacity he supervised the scoring of ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942) and contributed at least one sequence of his own music. His own U.S. scores for Korda included ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'' (1940), ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' (1941), and ''[[Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book|The Jungle Book]]'' (1942). From the last of these emerged ''The Jungle Book Suite'' for narrator and orchestra, which became popular as narrated by the film's star, [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], and was soon recorded in New York by RCA. The 78-rpm album became the first substantial recording of Hollywood film music. It was later recorded with R\u00f3zsa conducting the Frankenland State Orchestra of Nuremberg and [[Leo Genn]] as narrator.\n\nIn 1943, now associated with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], R\u00f3zsa scored the first of several collaborations with director [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[Five Graves to Cairo]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That same year that he also scored the similarly themed [[Humphrey Bogart]] film ''[[Sahara (1943 American film)|Sahara]]''. In 1944, his scores for a second Wilder collaboration, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and for ''[[The Woman of the Town]]'', both received Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1944, R\u00f3zsa was hired by producer [[David O. Selznick]] to compose the score for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''. The scoring process was notably contentious, with producer, director, and composer all expressing considerable dissatisfaction with each other. Numerous changes were made in the editing by Audray Granville, Selznick's assistant and de facto music director. The almost farcical history or artists at cross-purposes has been documented by Jack Sullivan (''Hitchcock's Music'', 2006) and especially Nathan Platte (''Making Music in Selznick's Hollywood'', 2018). Nevertheless, the film, finally released in late 1945, was a hit, and the music became extraordinarily popular in its own right. The combination of lush melody for the romance and frenzied expressionism for the suspense scenes proved irresistible. R\u00f3zsa's pioneering (for Hollywood) use of the [[theremin]] contributed to the effect, and the attention it generated likely influenced his Academy Award nomination. Two of his other 1945 scores were also nominated, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' and ''[[A Song to Remember]]'', but the Oscar was awarded to ''Spellbound''. Although Selznick was unhappy with the score, his innovative radio promotion of the music contributed to both the film's and the composer's popularity. R\u00f3zsa eventually arranged his themes as the ''Spellbound Concerto'', which (in multiple versions) has enjoyed lasting success in concerts and recordings.\n\nR\u00f3zsa earned another Oscar nomination for scoring ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946) which introduced [[Burt Lancaster]] to film audiences.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Part of the famed theme for the ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'' radio and TV show duplicated part of Rozsa's ''The Killers'' main theme, and he successfully sued for damages, and subsequently was given co-credit for the ''Dragnet'' theme.\n\nR\u00f3zsa received his second Oscar for ''[[A Double Life (1947 film)|A Double Life]]'' (1947), in which [[Ronald Colman]], as a Shakespearean actor playing Othello, becomes murderously disturbed in his offstage life. R\u00f3zsa later adopted the title for his own memoir, signifying his desire to keep his personal music distinct from his movie career. That same year R\u00f3zsa and Eugene Zador orchestrated music by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] for the film ''[[Song of Scheherazade]]'', about a fictional episode in the composer's life. R\u00f3zsa also wrote original music for the film. Also in 1947, he scored the music for the psychological thriller ''[[The Red House (film)|The Red House]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAmong other films scored by R\u00f3zsa during the 1940s were the prison drama ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947), also with Lancaster, and ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), the latter also including music by [[Frank Skinner (composer)|Frank Skinner]]. Both of those films were directed by [[Jules Dassin]].\n\n''[[Madame Bovary (1949 film)|Madame Bovary]]'' (1949) was R\u00f3zsa's first important score for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which produced most of the later films that he scored. Other popular scores that he composed for MGM pictures include ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951), ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1952), ''[[Plymouth Adventure]]'' (1952), ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1953), ''[[Green Fire]]'' (1954). ''[[Moonfleet (1955 film)|Moonfleet]]'' (1955),'' [[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), ''[[Lust for Life (1956 film)|Lust for Life]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961) and ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nFor ''Ben-Hur'', R\u00f3zsa received his third and final Oscar. His final two nominations (one each for Best Original Score and Best Original Song) were for the 1961 [[Samuel Bronston]] film ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]''.\n\nIn 1968, he was asked to score ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', after [[Elmer Bernstein]] turned it down due to his political beliefs. R\u00f3zsa initially declined the offer, saying, \"I don't do westerns.\"  However, he agreed to compose the score after being informed, \"It's not a Western, it's an 'Eastern'.\" He produced a strong and varied score, which included a nightclub vocal by a Vietnamese singer, B\u1ea1ch Y\u1ebfn. However, one cue which incorporated stanzas of \"[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]\" was deleted from the film's final edit.\n\nHis popular film scores during the 1970s included his last two Billy Wilder collaborations ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970) and ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), the [[Ray Harryhausen]] fantasy sequel ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973), the latter-day ''[[film noir]]'' ''[[Last Embrace]]'' starring [[Roy Scheider]], and the time-travel fantasy film ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' (1979) for which R\u00f3zsa won a Science Fiction Film Award, saying in his televised acceptance speech that of all the film scores he had ever composed, it was the one he had worked on the hardest.\n\nAfter completing work on the music for the spy thriller ''[[Eye of the Needle (film)|Eye of the Needle]]'' (1981), R\u00f3zsa's last film score was for the black-and-white [[Steve Martin]] film ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' (1982), a comic homage to the ''film noir'' films of the 1940s, a genre to which Rozsa himself had contributed scores.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Although R\u00f3zsa's career as a composer for films ended following a stroke he suffered while on holiday in Italy later that year, he continued to compose various concert pieces thereafter; one of his last works being Sonata for Ondes Martenot, op. 45 (1989).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pytheasmusic.org/rozsa.html |title=Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa (1907-1995) |publisher=Pytheas Center for Contemporary Music |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to California at the behest of his son, and remained sequestered at his home for the remainder of his life.\n\n==Death==\nR\u00f3zsa died on 27 July 1995,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and is buried at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_rozsa.htm |title=American Composers Orchestra - David Raksin Remembers His Colleagues |publisher=Americancomposers.org |date=1907-04-18 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> His wife, Margaret, died in 1999, aged 89.\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa}}\nR\u00f3zsa's first major success was the orchestral ''Theme, Variations, and Finale'', Op. 13, introduced in Duisburg, Germany, in 1934 and soon taken up by [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Karl B\u00f6hm]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Hans Swarowsky]], and other leading conductors.\n\nIt was first played in the United States by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Hans Lange]] on 28\u201329 October 1937, and achieved wide exposure through a 1943 New York Philharmonic concert broadcast when [[Leonard Bernstein]] made his famous conducting debut.\n\nBy 1952, his film score work was proving so successful that he was able to negotiate a clause in his contract with MGM that gave him three months each year away from the film studio so that he could focus on concert music.\n\nR\u00f3zsa's Violin Concerto, Op. 24, was composed in 1953\u201354 for the [[violin]]ist [[Jascha Heifetz]], who collaborated with the composer in fine-tuning it. R\u00f3zsa later adapted portions of this work for the score of [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970). R\u00f3zsa's Cello Concerto, Op. 32 was written much later (1967\u201368) at the request of the [[cellist]] [[J\u00e1nos Starker]], who premiered the work in Berlin in 1969.\n\nBetween his violin and cello concertos, R\u00f3zsa composed his Sinfonia Concertante, Op. 29, for violin, cello, and orchestra. The commissioning artists, Heifetz and his frequent collaborator [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], never performed the finished work, although they did record a reduced version of the slow movement, called ''Tema con Variazoni'', Op. 29a.\n\nR\u00f3zsa also received recognition for his choral works. His collaboration with conductor Maurice Skones and The Choir of the West at [[Pacific Lutheran University]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], resulted in a commercial recording of his sacred choral works\u2014''[[To Everything There is a Season]]'', Op. 20; ''[[The Vanities of Life]]'', Op. 30; and ''[[Psalm 23|The Twenty-Third Psalm]]'', Op. 34\u2014produced by John Steven Lasher and recorded by Allen Giles for the [[Entr'acte Recording Society]] in 1978.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe seventh variation (after the theme) of his \"Theme, Variations And Finale\", Op. 13, was used as part of the soundtrack in four episodes\u2014most notably \"The Clown Who Cried\"\u2014of 1950s television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''\"Quo Vadis?\" Film Music Notes,'' Vol. 11, No. 2 (1951)\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''Double Life: The Autobiography of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Composer in the Golden Years of Hollywood'', Seven Hills Books (1989) - {{ISBN|0-85936-209-4}}\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''Double Life: The Autobiography of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Composer in the Golden Years of Hollywood'', The Baton Press (1984) - {{ISBN|0-85936-141-1}} (Softcover edition)\n* Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa: ''\u00c9letem t\u00f6rt\u00e9neteib\u0151l'' (Discussions with [[J\u00e1nos Sebesty\u00e9n]], edited by Gy\u00f6rgy Lehotay-Horv\u00e1th).
