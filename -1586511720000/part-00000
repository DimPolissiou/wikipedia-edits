The Irving district [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system dates to the 1909 establishment of Kit and Lively schools. Population growth was slow and sometimes halting, with only 357 residents in 1925, but a significant increase began in the 1930s.\n\nBy the early 1960s the city had a population of approximately 45,000.

Irving began in 1889 as an area called Gorbit, and in 1894 the name changed to Kit.<ref name=\"City of Irving - Irving Archives\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofirving.org/1993/Between-the-Forks |title=Between the Forks |website=City of Irving \u2013 Irving Archives}}</ref> Irving was incorporated April 14, 1914, with Otis Brown as the first mayor.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century the Irving area was the site of [[church (building)|churches]], two [[cotton gin]]s, a [[blacksmith]] shop and a general store. The Irving district [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system dates to the 1909 establishment of Kit and Lively schools. Population growth was slow and sometimes halting, with only 357 residents in 1925, but a significant increase began in the 1930s.\n\nBy the early 1960s the city had a population of approximately 45,000. A number of [[manufacturing]] plants operated in Irving, along with [[transportation]], [[retail]] and [[financial]] businesses.
