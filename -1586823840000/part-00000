Keyboards reminiscent of [[power metal]] are also sometimes featured.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSymphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname '''opera metal''' or '''operatic metal''', and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing [[Death growl|growls]], a more common characteristic of [[gothic metal]]. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Dutch bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Within Temptation]], Finnish band [[Nightwish]], and Swedish band [[Therion (band)|Therion]]. All four bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in [[film score]]s in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.\n\n==Musical characteristics==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n| image1    = Tarja Turunen at Obras Stadium 2008 02.jpg\n| image2    = Tuomas-Holopainen-keyboards1.JPG\n| footer    = Nightwish is one of the prime acts on the symphonic metal scene.

Other instruments including guitars, bass and drums typically play relatively simple parts in contrast to the complex and nuanced keyboard and/or orchestral parts. Bands that do not use live orchestral instrumentation on their recordings or when playing live typically utilize factory presets on workstation keyboards (i.&nbsp;e., strings, choirs, pianos, pipe organs etc.) to conjure up a \"pseudo-orchestral\" sound, where parts are played idiomatically according to keyboard technique. This is particularly characteristic of less-known bands on tighter budgets. Some symphonic metal bands abstain from using keyboards entirely, choosing to use orchestral backing tracks, either recorded by a live symphony orchestra and/or choir during an album session, or recorded using virtual software instruments in a [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]. This is particularly characteristic of bands that feature deeper and more complex arrangements that would be more difficult for one or even two keyboardists to reproduce in a live performance.\n\nIt is more difficult to generalise about the guitar and bass work found in this style. As with gothic metal, this can often be described as a synthesis of other rock and metal styles, with black metal, [[death metal]], power metal, and [[progressive metal]] elements being the most common; but unlike in gothic metal, elements of classical music are frequently present as well. With varying frequency, the majority of bands in this subgenre employ these instruments (as well as the lead vocals) to play more simple, catchy melodies which arguably makes symphonic metal (along with power metal, which shares this characteristic) one of the more accessible metal subgenres.\n\nSongs are often highly atmospheric, though more upbeat than those of other metal subgenres; even songs with morbid themes routinely feature prominent major-key fanfares. Particularly central to creating mood and atmosphere is the choice of keyboard sounds.\n\nLyrics cover a broad range of topics. As with two of symphonic metal's otherwise most dissimilar influences, power metal and opera (but also symphonic [[progressive rock]]), fantasy and mythological themes are common. [[Concept album]]s styled after operas or [[epic poem]]s are not uncommon.\n\nBands in this genre often feature a female lead vocalist, most commonly a [[soprano]]. There is sometimes a second, male vocalist, as is also common in gothic metal. Growling, death-metal-style vocals are not unknown, but tend to be used less frequently than in other metal genres that make use of this vocal style (however, a notable example of its usage is by [[Mark Jansen]] in [[Epica (band)|Epica]]). Further backup up to and including a full [[choir]] is sometimes employed.\n\nIt is very common for bands, almost exclusively female-fronted bands, to feature operatic lead vocals. Such bands can be referred to as ''operatic symphonic metal''<ref name=\"the manitoban\">The Manitoban (PDF-file, page 25): [http://hotink.theorem.ca/system/manit/issues/000/003/903/15oct2008_FINAL_screen_quality.pdf?1253635013 \u201cOpera Metal for the Masses\u201d] stored at [https://www.webcitation.org/5s9fQJw00?url=http://hotink.theorem.ca/system/manit/issues/000/003/903/15oct2008_FINAL_screen_quality.pdf?1253635013 webcitation.org]</ref> and include the likes of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Nightwish]] ([[Tarja Turunen]], then [[Floor Jansen]]), [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]],<ref name=\"the manitoban\"/> [[Therion (band)|Therion]], ''Operatika'', ''Dremora'', [[Dol Ammad]], [[Visions of Atlantis]], [[Aesma Daeva]], [[Almora (band)|Almora]] and countless others. The operatic style is not exclusively tied to symphonic metal, and also appears in avant-garde metal, progressive metal, gothic metal and melodic metal.\n\n==Origins and evolution==\nThe roots of symphonic metal are found in early [[death metal]] and [[gothic metal]] bands, who made some use of symphonic elements in their music, notably Swiss extreme metal pioneers [[Celtic Frost]] on their 1987 album ''[[Into the Pandemonium]]'', whose 1985 release ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'' inspired the naming of symphonic metal pioneers Therion.\n\nOne of the earliest symphonic metal songs was \"Dies Irae\" by American [[thrash metal]] group [[Believer (band)|Believer]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Treppel|first1=Jeff|title=The Lazarus Pit: Believer's Sanity Obscure|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/the-lazarus-pit-believers-sanity-obscure|website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|publisher=Alex Mulcahy|access-date=June 4, 2015|date=November 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119202902/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/the-lazarus-pit-believers-sanity-obscure|archive-date=2016-01-19|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Appearing on their 1990 album ''[[Sanity Obscure]]'', it foreshadowed the operatic approach used by the bands [[Therion (band)|Therion]] and [[Nightwish]].<ref name=meandeviation>{{Cite book |author=Jeff Wagner, Steven Wilson |title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |publication-date=2010 |pages=154\u2013157|isbn=0-9796163-3-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> According to Jeff Wagner in his book ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', the song was a creative watershed in metal, and except for [[Mekong Delta (band)|Mekong Delta]], no other [[extreme metal]] band at the time had merged the genre with [[classical music]] so seamlessly.<ref name=meandeviation />\n\n[[File:C. Johnsson and L. Lewis.jpg|left|thumb|[[Therion (band)|Therion]]'s [[Lori Lewis]] and [[Christofer Johnsson]] with symphonic orchestra and choir during the live classical show at the [[Miskolc Opera Festival]], Hungary, 2007.]] The band [[Therion (band)|Therion]] were influential in forming the genre through their use of a live orchestra and classical compositional techniques; gradually these elements became a more important part of Therion's music than their death metal roots. Another key early influence was Finnish [[progressive metal]] band [[Waltari]]'s album ''[[Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C]]''. In mid-1996 [[Rage (German band)|Rage]] released ''[[Lingua Mortis]]'', the band's first collaboration with the [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n[[Nightwish]] and [[Within Temptation]] released their first albums in 1997, which were heavily inspired by Therion's symphonic turn. Within Temptation was more influenced by gothic metal, and therefore musically simpler than the more power metal-influenced Nightwish, but both bands shared two key symphonic metal elements - powerful female lead vocals from [[Tarja Turunen]] and [[Sharon den Adel]] respectively, and the heavy use of classically influenced keyboard playing. [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]], which started as a [[Progressive Death metal|progressive death metal]] band, had released some [[Demo (music)|demos]] and [[Extended play|EPs]] some years ago using only their death metal style, but, in 1997, they went a step forward. They chose to change their style and to turn it into a mix of [[classical music]] with real classical and medieval instruments such as, [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[crumhorn]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[death metal]], releasing their first symphonic metal studio album.\n\nMany new symphonic metal bands appeared or came to wide attention in the early to mid 2000s, including Rain Fell Within, [[After Forever]], [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[Leaves' Eyes]], [[Xandria]], and [[Edenbridge (band)|Edenbridge]], all featuring the characteristic keyboards and female vocals. Power metal, with its relatively upbeat fantasy themes and stylized keyboard sounds, tended to be an important influence on these groups.\n\nThe term \"symphonic metal\" has sometimes been applied to individual songs or albums by bands that are primarily death metal, [[doom metal]], gothic metal, power metal, or black metal, for example renowned black metal act [[Dimmu Borgir]], who [[Simone Simons]] of Epica personally referenced as an inspiration.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} While this article has mainly discussed symphonic metal as a distinct subgenre, it is worth noting that the term is sometimes used to describe stylistic elements that can be found in nearly any heavy metal subgenre.\n\n==Symphonic metal subgenres==\n\nThe term \"symphonic metal\" is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements; \"symphonic metal\" then is not so much a genre as a cross-generic designation. A few bands refer to themselves as \"symphonic metal,\" particularly [[Aesma Daeva]], and the term could probably be applied to generically ambiguous metal bands like [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Nightwish]].\n\n{{multiple image | align = center\n| footer = Many symphonic metal artists and bands add symphonic or orchestral elements to other metal genres. British band [[Cradle of Filth]] blends symphonic metal with gothic and black metal. [[Luca Turilli]] is known as the guitarist for [[Rhapsody of Fire]] and several side projects that combines power metal with symphonic soundscapes, which he refers to as \"film score metal\". [[Floor Jansen]] and [[Mark Jansen]] (no relation) were members of symphonic gothic metal band [[After Forever]], before joining other symphonic metal bands; Floor staying in After Forever until their split-up then later joining symphonic power metal band [[Nightwish]], and Mark in symphonic metal band [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and symphonic death metal band [[Mayan (band)|MaYaN]].\n| image1 = Cradle of Filth - Wacken Open Air 2015-3736.jpg\n| width1 = 196\n| image2 = Luca Turilli Live.jpg\n| width2 = 218\n| image3 = Tuska 20130630 - Nightwish - 44.jpg\n| width3 = 165\n| image4 = Epica Hellfest 2007 18.jpg\n| width4 = 165\n}}\n\n===Symphonic black metal===\n{{Main|Symphonic black metal}}\n'''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' has similar components as [[melodic black metal]], but uses keyboarding or instruments normally found in symphonic or classical music. It can also include black metal bands that make heavy usage of atmospheric keyboarding in the music, akin to symphonic metal or [[gothic metal]].  The symphonic aspects of this genre are normally integral parts of a band, and as such are commonly used throughout the whole duration of a song. The prototypical symphonic black metal bands are [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Carach Angren]].\n\n===Symphonic power metal===<!-- This section is linked from [[Heavy metal music]] -->\n\n{{Infobox music genre\n|name              = Symphonic power metal\n|color             = white\n|bgcolor           = #BB0022\n|stylistic_origins = {{flatlist|\n*Symphonic metal\n*[[power metal]]\n*[[neoclassical metal]]\n}}\n|cultural_origins  = Early to mid-1990s, [[Finland]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]\n|instruments       =\n|popularity        =\n|derivatives       =\n|subgenres         =\n|fusiongenres      = \n|regional_scenes   = \n|other_topics      = \n}}\n\n'''Symphonic power metal''' refers to [[power metal]] bands that make extensive usage of keyboards, or instruments normally found in classical music, similar to symphonic metal. These additional elements are often used as key elements of the music when compared to regular power metal, contributing not only an extra layer to the music, but a greater variety of sound.  Bands in this genre often feature clean vocals, with some bands adding relatively small quantities of screams or growls.\n\nThe first prototypical symphonic power metal song was \"[[Art of Life]]\", a twenty-nine-minute song performed by Japanese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[X Japan]] in 1993. Finnish band [[Nightwish]] was another band that performed early symphonic power metal songs. Songs by Nightwish that illustrate the genre well are \"Wishmaster\" from the album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'', \"Ghost Love Score\" from the album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', \"The Poet and the Pendulum\" on the album ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'' and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", a 24-minute song from the album ''[[Endless Forms Most Beautiful (album)|Endless Forms Most Beautiful]]''. These songs follow the epic scope and extended formal structures characteristic of power metal while making extensive use of orchestral elements.\n\nAnother band fitting this description is [[Rhapsody of Fire]], an Italian band different from most typical symphonic metal bands in that it is not fronted by a female vocalist. With a blend of guitars, drums and extremely large soundscapes including, in their later years, a full choir and a symphonic orchestra, they take heavy influence from early classical music and in particular [[baroque music]].

Keyboards reminiscent of [[power metal]] are also sometimes featured.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSymphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname '''opera metal''' or '''operatic metal''', and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing [[Death growl|growls]], a more common characteristic of [[gothic metal]]. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Dutch bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Within Temptation]], Finnish band [[Nightwish]], and Swedish band [[Therion (band)|Therion]]. All four bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in [[film score]]s in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.\n\n==Musical characteristics==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n| image1    = Tarja Turunen at Obras Stadium 2008 02.jpg\n| image2    = Tuomas-Holopainen-keyboards1.JPG\n| footer    = Nightwish is one of the prime acts on the symphonic metal scene.

Other instruments including guitars, bass and drums typically play relatively simple parts in contrast to the complex and nuanced keyboard and/or orchestral parts. Bands that do not use live orchestral instrumentation on their recordings or when playing live typically utilize factory presets on workstation keyboards (i.&nbsp;e., strings, choirs, pianos, pipe organs etc.) to conjure up a \"pseudo-orchestral\" sound, where parts are played idiomatically according to keyboard technique. This is particularly characteristic of less-known bands on tighter budgets. Some symphonic metal bands abstain from using keyboards entirely, choosing to use orchestral backing tracks, either recorded by a live symphony orchestra and/or choir during an album session, or recorded using virtual software instruments in a [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]. This is particularly characteristic of bands that feature deeper and more complex arrangements that would be more difficult for one or even two keyboardists to reproduce in a live performance.\n\nIt is more difficult to generalise about the guitar and bass work found in this style. As with gothic metal, this can often be described as a synthesis of other rock and metal styles, with black metal, [[death metal]], power metal, and [[progressive metal]] elements being the most common; but unlike in gothic metal, elements of classical music are frequently present as well. With varying frequency, the majority of bands in this subgenre employ these instruments (as well as the lead vocals) to play more simple, catchy melodies which arguably makes symphonic metal (along with power metal, which shares this characteristic) one of the more accessible metal subgenres.\n\nSongs are often highly atmospheric, though more upbeat than those of other metal subgenres; even songs with morbid themes routinely feature prominent major-key fanfares. Particularly central to creating mood and atmosphere is the choice of keyboard sounds.\n\nLyrics cover a broad range of topics. As with two of symphonic metal's otherwise most dissimilar influences, power metal and opera (but also symphonic [[progressive rock]]), fantasy and mythological themes are common. [[Concept album]]s styled after operas or [[epic poem]]s are not uncommon.\n\nBands in this genre often feature a female lead vocalist, most commonly a [[soprano]]. There is sometimes a second, male vocalist, as is also common in gothic metal. Growling, death-metal-style vocals are not unknown, but tend to be used less frequently than in other metal genres that make use of this vocal style (however, a notable example of its usage is by [[Mark Jansen]] in [[Epica (band)|Epica]]). Further backup up to and including a full [[choir]] is sometimes employed.\n\nIt is very common for bands, almost exclusively female-fronted bands, to feature operatic lead vocals. Such bands can be referred to as ''operatic symphonic metal''<ref name=\"the manitoban\">The Manitoban (PDF-file, page 25): [http://hotink.theorem.ca/system/manit/issues/000/003/903/15oct2008_FINAL_screen_quality.pdf?1253635013 \u201cOpera Metal for the Masses\u201d] stored at [https://www.webcitation.org/5s9fQJw00?url=http://hotink.theorem.ca/system/manit/issues/000/003/903/15oct2008_FINAL_screen_quality.pdf?1253635013 webcitation.org]</ref> and include the likes of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Nightwish]] ([[Tarja Turunen]], then [[Floor Jansen]]), [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]],<ref name=\"the manitoban\"/> [[Therion (band)|Therion]], ''Operatika'', ''Dremora'', [[Dol Ammad]], [[Visions of Atlantis]], [[Aesma Daeva]], [[Almora (band)|Almora]] and countless others. The operatic style is not exclusively tied to symphonic metal, and also appears in avant-garde metal, progressive metal, gothic metal and melodic metal.\n\n==Origins and evolution==\nThe roots of symphonic metal are found in early [[death metal]] and [[gothic metal]] bands, who made some use of symphonic elements in their music, notably Swiss extreme metal pioneers [[Celtic Frost]] on their 1987 album ''[[Into the Pandemonium]]'', whose 1985 release ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'' inspired the naming of symphonic metal pioneers Therion.\n\nOne of the earliest symphonic metal songs was \"Dies Irae\" by American [[thrash metal]] group [[Believer (band)|Believer]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Treppel|first1=Jeff|title=The Lazarus Pit: Believer's Sanity Obscure|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/the-lazarus-pit-believers-sanity-obscure|website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|publisher=Alex Mulcahy|access-date=June 4, 2015|date=November 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119202902/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/the-lazarus-pit-believers-sanity-obscure|archive-date=2016-01-19|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Appearing on their 1990 album ''[[Sanity Obscure]]'' foreshadowed the operatic approach used by the bands [[Therion (band)|Therion]] and [[Nightwish]].<ref name=meandeviation>{{Cite book |author=Jeff Wagner, Steven Wilson |title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |publication-date=2010 |pages=154\u2013157|isbn=0-9796163-3-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> According to Jeff Wagner in his book ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', the song was a creative watershed in metal, and except for [[Mekong Delta (band)|Mekong Delta]], no other [[extreme metal]] band at the time had merged the genre with [[classical music]] so seamlessly.<ref name=meandeviation />\n\n[[File:C.

Another key early influence was Finnish [[progressive metal]] band [[Waltari]]'s album ''[[Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C]]''. In mid-1996 [[Rage (German band)|Rage]] released ''[[Lingua Mortis]]'', the band's first collaboration with the [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n[[Nightwish]] and [[Within Temptation]] released their first albums in 1997, which were heavily inspired by Therion's symphonic turn. Within Temptation was more influenced by gothic metal, and therefore musically simpler than the more power metal-influenced Nightwish, but both bands shared two key symphonic metal elements - powerful female lead vocals from [[Tarja Turunen]] and [[Sharon den Adel]] respectively, and the heavy use of classically influenced keyboard playing. [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]], which started as a [[Progressive Death metal|progressive death metal]] band, had released some [[Demo (music)|demos]] and [[Extended play|EPs]] some years ago using only their death metal style, but, in 1997, they went a step forward. They chose to change their style and to turn it into a mix of [[classical music]] with real classical and medieval instruments such as, [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[crumhorn]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[death metal]], releasing their first symphonic metal studio album.\n\nMany new symphonic metal bands appeared or came to wide attention in the early to mid 2000s, including Rain Fell Within, [[After Forever]], [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[Leaves' Eyes]], [[Xandria]], and [[Edenbridge (band)|Edenbridge]], all featuring the characteristic keyboards and female vocals. Power metal, with its relatively upbeat fantasy themes and stylized keyboard sounds, tended to be an important influence on these groups.\n\nThe term \"symphonic metal\" has sometimes been applied to individual songs or albums by bands that are primarily death metal, [[doom metal]], gothic metal, power metal, or black metal, for example renowned black metal act [[Dimmu Borgir]], who [[Simone Simons]] of Epica personally referenced as an inspiration.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} While this article has mainly discussed symphonic metal as a distinct subgenre, it is worth noting that the term is sometimes used to describe stylistic elements that can be found in nearly any heavy metal subgenre.\n\n==Symphonic metal subgenres==\n\nThe term \"symphonic metal\" is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements; \"symphonic metal\" then is not so much a genre as a cross-generic designation. A few bands refer to themselves as \"symphonic metal,\" particularly [[Aesma Daeva]], and the term could probably be applied to generically ambiguous metal bands like [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Nightwish]].\n\n{{multiple image | align = center\n| footer = Many symphonic metal artists and bands add symphonic or orchestral elements to other metal genres. British band [[Cradle of Filth]] blends symphonic metal with gothic and black metal. [[Luca Turilli]] is known as the guitarist for [[Rhapsody of Fire]] and several side projects that combines power metal with symphonic soundscapes, which he refers to as \"film score metal\". [[Floor Jansen]] and [[Mark Jansen]] (no relation) were members of symphonic gothic metal band [[After Forever]], before joining other symphonic metal bands; Floor staying in After Forever until their split-up then later joining symphonic power metal band [[Nightwish]], and Mark in symphonic metal band [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and symphonic death metal band [[Mayan (band)|MaYaN]].\n| image1 = Cradle of Filth - Wacken Open Air 2015-3736.jpg\n| width1 = 196\n| image2 = Luca Turilli Live.jpg\n| width2 = 218\n| image3 = Tuska 20130630 - Nightwish - 44.jpg\n| width3 = 165\n| image4 = Epica Hellfest 2007 18.jpg\n| width4 = 165\n}}\n\n===Symphonic black metal===\n{{Main|Symphonic black metal}}\n'''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' has similar components as [[melodic black metal]], but uses keyboarding or instruments normally found in symphonic or classical music. It can also include black metal bands that make heavy usage of atmospheric keyboarding in the music, akin to symphonic metal or [[gothic metal]].  The symphonic aspects of this genre are normally integral parts of a band, and as such are commonly used throughout the whole duration of a song. The prototypical symphonic black metal bands are [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Carach Angren]].\n\n===Symphonic power metal===<!-- This section is linked from [[Heavy metal music]] -->\n\n{{Infobox music genre\n|name              = Symphonic power metal\n|color             = white\n|bgcolor           = #BB0022\n|stylistic_origins = {{flatlist|\n*Symphonic metal\n*[[power metal]]\n*[[neoclassical metal]]\n}}\n|cultural_origins  = Early to mid-1990s, [[Finland]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]\n|instruments       =\n|popularity        =\n|derivatives       =\n|subgenres         =\n|fusiongenres      = \n|regional_scenes   = \n|other_topics      = \n}}\n\n'''Symphonic power metal''' refers to [[power metal]] bands that make extensive usage of keyboards, or instruments normally found in classical music, similar to symphonic metal. These additional elements are often used as key elements of the music when compared to regular power metal, contributing not only an extra layer to the music, but a greater variety of sound.  Bands in this genre often feature clean vocals, with some bands adding relatively small quantities of screams or growls.\n\nThe first prototypical symphonic power metal song was \"[[Art of Life]]\", a twenty-nine-minute song performed by Japanese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[X Japan]] in 1993. Finnish band [[Nightwish]] was another band that performed early symphonic power metal songs. Songs by Nightwish that illustrate the genre well are \"Wishmaster\" from the album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'', \"Ghost Love Score\" from the album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', \"The Poet and the Pendulum\" on the album ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'' and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", a 24-minute song from the album ''[[Endless Forms Most Beautiful (album)|Endless Forms Most Beautiful]]''. These songs follow the epic scope and extended formal structures characteristic of power metal while making extensive use of orchestral elements.\n\nAnother band fitting this description is [[Rhapsody of Fire]], an Italian band different from most typical symphonic metal bands in that it is not fronted by a female vocalist. With a blend of guitars, drums and extremely large soundscapes including, in their later years, a full choir and a symphonic orchestra, they take heavy influence from early classical music and in particular [[baroque music]]. Most of their albums are a part of an epic [[high fantasy]] saga. Songs by Rhapsody of Fire that illustrate the genre well are \"The Mystic Prophecy of the Demonknight\" on the album ''[[Triumph or Agony]]'' and \"Emerald Sword\" from the album ''[[Symphony of Enchanted Lands]]''.  Other examples of bands fitting this description are [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Avantasia]], [[Dark Moor]], [[Dragonland]], [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Kamelot]], [[Pathfinder (band)|Pathfinder]], [[Phoenix Rising (band)|Phoenix Rising]], [[Sonata Arctica]], [[Serenity (band)|Serenity]], [[Theocracy (band)|Theocracy]], [[Twilight Force]], and [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]].\n\n===Symphonic gothic metal===<!-- This section was originally written in the [[gothic metal]] article -->\n{{Infobox music genre\n|name              = Symphonic gothic metal\n|color             = white\n|bgcolor           = #BB0022\n|stylistic_origins = {{flatlist|\n*Symphonic metal\n*[[gothic metal]]\n*[[doom metal]]\n}}\n|cultural_origins  = Mid 1990s, [[Norway]] and the [[Netherlands]]\n|instruments       =\n|popularity        =\n|derivatives       =\n|subgenres         =\n|fusiongenres      = \n|regional_scenes   = \n|other_topics      = \n}}\n\nOne of the first gothic metal bands to release a full album featuring \"Beauty and the Beast\" vocals, where [[death metal]] vocals are contrasted with clean female vocals, was the Norwegian [[Theatre of Tragedy]] in 1995. From then on after the departure of lead singer, [[Liv Kristine]], in 2003, she and her future husband, [[Alexander Krull]] went on to form the symphonic metal band, [[Leaves' Eyes]]. The band is one of the pioneers of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" vocal style scene.

Typically, the female will only create and lay one egg case per day, though they may create up to 20 egg cases in the weeks following a mating event and each case may produce from 1-32 individual larva. Females who have not mated will still create egg cases, but they will typically be empty or will not hatch at all. Not all egg cases laid by a mated female will hatch and produce viable offspring, but 42-70% will. Larval forms are carnivorous and may exhibit [[cannibalism]] among the individuals in a single egg case before hatching. The eggs begin to hatch an average of eight days after being laid. The egg hatches by way of the larvae eating their way out of the casing, usually by way of the lid. This process can take several days in some instances. Once the egg hatches, the first instar [[Larva|larvae]] will disperse, but will continue to feed on one another if the opportunity presents itself. They will remain in the first instar form for an average of 9.5 days before progressing to the second instar. Second instar individuals are much more robust, and voraciously feed on what meat they can find. They are strong swimmers at this stage and can be found at or beneath the surface of the stream. After an average of 11 days, they will transition to their third instar form. The third instar will last an average of 8.4 days, during which the larvae will continue feeding and become progressively slower as they reach their [[Pupa|pupation]] stage. When they are ready to pupate, the larva will burrow into the sand where they will remain for 14 days before emerging as an adult. After vacating their burrow, the new adult will stand on the sand for up to 24 hours to allow its [[carapace]] to harden. Once fully hardened, the new fully grown adult beetle will travel to the water to hunt, where it will remain for the rest of its life.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAlthough individuals of each species of hydrophilid (even those within the same [[genus]]) may vary in the duration of each of these life stages, mortality rates at each stage, and the number of offspring produced, few studies have been done to this effect on other species of hydrophilid.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nLarval hydrophilids are predatory by nature and different species have different food consumption habits.

Reproduction by parthenogenesis is relatively uncommon in other types of insects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angus|first=Robert B.|last2=Jia|first2=Fenglong|date=2020-01-13|title=Triploidy in Chinese parthenogenetic Helophorus orientalis Motschulsky, 1860, further data on parthenogenetic H. brevipalpis Bedel, 1881 and a brief discussion of parthenogenesis in Hydrophiloidea (Coleoptera)|url=https://compcytogen.pensoft.net/article/47656/|journal=Comparative Cytogenetics|language=en|volume=14(1)|pages=1\u201310|doi=10.3897/CompCytogen.v14i1.47656|issn=1993-078X|pmc=PMC6971125|pmid=31988701}}</ref>\n\n== Life Stages ==\nIn ''Enochrus quadripunctatus'', a species of hydrophilid beetle, it takes an average of 43 days for a newly hatched larva to reach its adult form. Juvenile mortality is high in this species, decreasing with each successive [[instar]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|date=1995-12-01|title=LIFE HISTORY, BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE IMMATURE STAGES OF ENOCHRUS QUADRIPUNCTATUS HERBST IN THE LABORATORY (COLEOPTERA: HY DROPHILIDAE) 11- MORPHOLOGY|url=https://jsciences.ut.ac.ir/article_31260.html|journal=Journal of Sciences, Islamic Republic of Iran|volume=6|issue=4|issn=1016-1104}}</ref>\n\nFemales will bury their silken egg case in the damp soil near a stream. Typically, the female will only create and lay one egg case per day, though they may create up to 20 egg cases in the weeks following a mating event and each case may produce from 1-32 individual larva. Females who have not mated will still create egg cases, but they will typically be empty or will not hatch at all. Not all egg cases laid by a mated female will hatch and produce viable offspring, but 42-70% will. Larval forms are carnivorous and may exhibit [[cannibalism]] among the individuals in a single egg case before hatching. The eggs begin to hatch an average of eight days after being laid. The egg hatches by way of the larvae eating their way out of the casing, usually by way of the lid. This process can take several days in some instances. Once the egg hatches, the first instar [[Larva|larvae]] will disperse, but will continue to feed on one another if the opportunity presents itself. They will remain in the first instar form for an average of 9.5 days before progressing to the second instar. Second instar individuals are much more robust, and voraciously feed on what meat they can find. They are strong swimmers at this stage and can be found at or beneath the surface of the stream. After an average of 11 days, they will transition to their third instar form. The third instar will last an average of 8.4 days, during which the larvae will continue feeding and become progressively slower as they reach their [[Pupa|pupation]] stage. When they are ready to pupate, the larva will burrow into the sand where they will remain for 14 days before emerging as an adult. After vacating their burrow, the new adult will stand on the sand for up to 24 hours to allow its [[carapace]] to harden. Once fully hardened, the new fully grown adult beetle will travel to the water to hunt, where it will remain for the rest of its life.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAlthough individuals of each species of hydrophilid (even those within the same [[genus]]) may vary in the duration of each of these life stages, mortality rates at each stage, and the number of offspring produced, few studies have been done to this effect on other species of hydrophilid.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Diet ==\nLarval hydrophilids are predatory by nature and different species have different food consumption habits. The larvae usually ingest small [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]] and [[Snail|snails]] but have been known to also eat small [[fish]] and [[Tadpole|tadpoles]].<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Berosus ingeminatus'' prey mostly on [[Cricotopus sylvestris|''Cricotopus sylvestris'']] and other types of [[Midge|midges]] while ''Tropisternus setiger'' are tactile hunters and will eat whatever prey comes their way; they may even abandon a meal for a new one if the opportunity arises.<ref name=\":2\" /> The predatory habits of this species are often left behind in the larval stage. Generally adult hydrophilids feed on various vegetation, alive or decaying, and will occasionally eat dead animal tissue.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Predators ==\nHydrophilids have many predators from a range of different species. Fish, birds, predaceous insects, and turtles are the main predators in their aquatic environments.
