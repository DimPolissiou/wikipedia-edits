Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\". It was a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] device and therefore required no [[electrical power]] source to operate.\n\nIn 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]) and [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions.<ref>{{cite book |date=1965 |title=Army R, D & A. |publisher=Development and Engineering Directorate, HQ, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sTrO77DCgkwC&pg=RA6-PA33&lpg=RA6-PA33&dq=Army+Emergency+Respirator,+HDL#v=onepage&q=Army%20Emergency%20Respirator,%20HDL&f=false}}</ref> Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Mon |first1=George |last2=Woodward |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Straub |first3=Henrik |last4=Joyce |first4=James |last5=Meyer |first5=James |date=1966 |title=Fluid Amplifier-Controlled Medical Devices |journal=SAE Transactions |issn=0096-736X |jstor=44554326 |volume=74 |pages=217\u2013222}}</ref> The mask is composed of a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (commercially known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Lucite]]) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Army Research and Development Monthly Magazine |volume=6 |number=9 |url=https://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/archives/1965/Sep_1965.PDF}}</ref> The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller.

It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation.\n\nVentilators used under increased pressure (hyperbaric) require special precautions, and few ventilators can operate under these conditions.<ref name=SPUMS1998>{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=M |year=1998 |title=Ventilator function under hyperbaric conditions |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5927 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> In 1979, Sechrist Industries introduced their Model 500A ventilator, which was specifically designed for use with [[hyperbaric chamber]]s.<ref name=JHM1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver LK, Greenway L, Elliot CG |year=1988 |title=Performance of the Seachrist 500A Hyperbaric Ventilator in a Monoplace Hyperbaric Chamber |journal=Journal of Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=215\u2013225 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4377 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Microprocessor ventilators===\n[[Microprocessor control]] led to the third generation of [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) ventilators, starting with the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] EV-A<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00e4ger - die Geschichte des Unternehmens |language= |publisher=Dr\u00e4ger |website=Dr\u00e4ger |url=https://www.draeger.com/Corporate/Content/draeger_die_geschichte_des_unternehmens.pdf |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref> in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patient's [[Breathing#Respiratory_disorders|breathing curve]] on an [[LCD monitor]].

Bush]]), the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] ([[BARDA]]) of the [[United States]] realized that the country was likely to have an epidemic of respiratory disease and would need more ventilators, so it awarded a $6 million contract to [[Newport Medical Instruments]], a small company in California, to make 40,000 ventilators for under $3,000 apiece. In 2011, Newport sent three prototypes to the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. In 2012, [[Covidien]], a $12 billion/year medical device manufacturer, which manufactured more expensive competing ventilators, bought Newport for $100 million. Covidien delayed and in 2014 cancelled the contract.\n\nBARDA started over again with a new company, [[Philips]], and in July 2019, the [[FDA]] approved the Philips ventilator, and the government ordered 10,000 ventilators for delivery in mid-2020.<ref name=\"Aura\">{{cite news\n| author = Nicholas Kulish, Sarah Kliff and Jessica Silver-Greenberg\n| title = The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\".

It has also been widely used for all sorts of utensils due to many properties, such as low melting point, workability (both with hand tools and with modern [[lathe|turning]] and [[milling (machining)|milling]] machines), durability, [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. It is still commonly used in applications where low [[friction]] and corrosion resistance is required, such as [[padlock|lock]]s, [[hinge]]s, [[gear]]s, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[ammunition]] casings, [[zipper]]s, [[plumbing]], [[hose coupling]]s, [[valve]]s, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical plugs and sockets]].  It is used extensively for [[brass instrument|musical instruments]] such as [[horn  (instrument)|horn]]s and [[metallophone|bell]]s, and also used as substitute of copper in making [[costume jewelry]], [[fashion jewellery|fashion jewelry]] and other imitation jewelry. The composition of brass, generally 66 percent copper and 34 percent zinc, makes it favorable substitute for copper based jewelry as it exhibits greater resistance to corrosion. Brass is often used in situations in which it is important that [[spark (fire)|spark]]s not be struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.<ref>[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/hand_tools/nonsparking.html OSH Answers: Non-sparking tools].

The relatively low [[melting point]] of brass ({{Convert|900|to|940|C|disp=comma}}, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast.

Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry, where it is melted and recast into [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]]s.

The general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of [[cutting fluid]], though there are exceptions to this.<ref name=\"Camm1949\">{{cite book|author=Frederick James Camm|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=George Newnes|page=594}}</ref>\n\nAluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in [[seawater]] applications (naval brasses).

However, if brass is placed in contact with a more noble metal such as silver or gold in such an environment, the brass will corrode galvanically; conversely, if brass is in contact with a less-noble metal such as zinc or iron, the less noble metal will corrode and the brass will be protected.\n\n==Lead content==\nTo enhance the machinability of brass, [[lead]] is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower [[melting point]] than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content.

Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.\n\nAn example of DZR brass is the C352 brass, with about 30% zinc, 61-63% copper, 1.7-2.8% lead, and 0.02-0.15% arsenic. The lead and arsenic significantly suppress the zinc loss.<ref>https://www.metalalloyscorporation.com/pdf/c352-dezincification-resistant-brass.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Red brasses\", family of alloys with high copper proportion and generally less than 15% zinc, are more resistant to zinc loss. One of the metals called \"red brass\" is 85% copper, 5% tin, 5% lead, and 5% zinc. Copper Alloy C23000, which is also known as \"red brass\", contains 84\u201386% copper, 0.05% each iron and lead, with the balance being zinc.\n\nAnother such material is [[gunmetal]], from the family of red brasses. Gunmetal alloys contain roughly 88% copper, 8-10% tin, and 2-4% zinc. Lead can be added for ease of machining or for bearing alloys.\n\n\"Naval brass\", for use in seawater, contains 40% zinc but also 1% tin. The tin addition suppresses zinc leaching.\n\nThe [[NSF International]] requires brasses with more than 15% zinc, used in [[piping and plumbing fitting]]s, to be dezincification-resistant.<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/composition-of-common-brass-alloys-2340109</ref>\n\n==Use in musical instruments==\n[[File:Trumpets02262006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A collection of brass instruments]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe high [[Ductility|malleability]] and workability, relatively good resistance to [[corrosion]], and traditionally attributed [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of [[musical instrument]]s whose acoustic [[resonator]]s consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; [[silver]] and its alloys, and even [[gold]], have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. Collectively known as [[brass instrument]]s, these include the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]], and many other \"[[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s\", many in variously-sized families, such as the [[saxhorns]]. \n\nOther [[wind instrument]]s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s are made of some variety of brass, usually a [[cupronickel]] [[alloy]] similar to [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. [[Clarinets]], especially low clarinets such as the [[Contrabass clarinet|contrabass]] and [[Subcontrabass clarinet|subcontrabass]], are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller [[woodwind]]s. For the same reason, some low [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]]s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the [[saxophone]]s and [[sarrusophone]]s are classified as [[woodwind instrument]]s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.\n\nThe keywork of most modern [[woodwind]]s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools\u2014a boon to quick repairs. The [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]s of both [[brass instruments]] and, less commonly, [[woodwind]] instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.\n\nNext to the [[brass instruments]], the most notable use of brass in music is in various [[percussion instrument]]s, most notably [[cymbal]]s, [[gong]]s, and [[chimes|orchestral (tubular) bells]] (large \"church\" [[bell]]s are normally made of [[bronze]]). Small [[handbell]]s and \"[[jingle bell]]\" are also commonly made of brass.\n\nThe [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat \"through\" the shallot in the case of a \"free\" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass.

The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[British Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.\n\n==Brass types==\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Cu Zn.svg|thumb|right|400px|Binary phase diagram]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | Proportion by weight (%)\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n!

The alpha phase is a substitution [[solid solution]] of zinc in copper. It is close in properties to copper, tough, strong, and somewhat difficult to machine. Best formability is with 32% of zinc.

In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd\u0101n\u012b|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) \"The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe\" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252\u20137</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the \"power\" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176\u20138</ref> \nGerman brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173\u20135</ref>\n\n===Brass in Africa===\n[[File:Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century \"[[Bronze Head from Ife]]\", actually of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\"]]\nSome of the most famous objects in [[African art]] are the [[lost wax]] castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now [[Nigeria]], produced first by the [[Kingdom of Ife]] and then the [[Benin Empire]].  Though normally described as \"bronzes\", the [[Benin Bronzes]], now mostly in the [[British Museum]] and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the [[Bronze Head from Ife]] of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\" and the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=618380 \"The Ife Head\"] on the British Museum collection database. Accessed 26 May 2014</ref>  Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in [[Benin art]] and other West African traditions such as [[Akan goldweights]], where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.\n\n===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95\u2013111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105\u20136</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref>\n\n16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181\u20132, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>\n\nEventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloy]]ed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering,<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref> and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was \"nothing else but unmeltable zinc\" and that zinc was a \"half ripe metal.\"<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198\u20139</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\"/>\n \nHowever, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900\u2013950&nbsp;\u00b0C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226\u20137.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\">Day 1990, p. 131</ref> By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\"/> After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].<ref>Day 1991, pp. 135\u201344</ref> In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.<ref>Day 1990, p. 138</ref> This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 227</ref>\n\nIn 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or \"the English process\".<ref>Day 1991, pp. 179\u201381</ref><ref name=r3/> This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clock]]s, brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\">Day 1991, p. 183</ref> However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\"/> and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].<ref name=r2/> By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc<ref>Day 1991, pp. 186\u20139</ref> as well as demand for [[corrosion]]-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.<ref>Day 1991, pp. 192\u20133, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.

It has also been widely used for all sorts of utensils due to many properties, such as low melting point, workability (both with hand tools and with modern [[lathe|turning]] and [[milling (machining)|milling]] machines), durability, [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. It is still commonly used in applications where low [[friction]] and corrosion resistance is required, such as [[padlock|lock]]s, [[hinge]]s, [[gear]]s, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[ammunition]] casings, [[zipper]]s, [[plumbing]], [[hose coupling]]s, [[valve]]s, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical plugs and sockets]].  It is used extensively for [[brass instrument|musical instruments]] such as [[horn  (instrument)|horn]]s and [[metallophone|bell]]s, and also used as substitute of copper in making [[costume jewelry]], [[fashion jewellery|fashion jewelry]] and other imitation jewelry. The composition of brass, generally 66 percent copper and 34 percent zinc,makes it favorable substitute for copper based jewelry as it exhibits greater resistance to corrosion. Brass is often used in situations in which it is important that [[spark (fire)|spark]]s not be struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.<ref>[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/hand_tools/nonsparking.html OSH Answers: Non-sparking tools].

The general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of [[cutting fluid]], though there are exceptions to this.<ref name=\"Camm1949\">{{cite book|author=Frederick James Camm|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=George Newnes|page=594}}</ref>\n\nAluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in [[seawater]] applications (naval brasses). Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass [[wear]]- and [[Tear resistance|tear-resistant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/brass/downloads/117/117-section-6-types-of-brass.pdf |title=Pub 117 The Brasses \u2013 Properties & Applications |accessdate=2012-05-09 |author=Copper Development Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030061920/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/brass/downloads/117/117-section-6-types-of-brass.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}</ref> Notably, the addition of as little as 1% iron to a brass alloy will result in an alloy with a noticeable magnetic attraction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scrapmetaljunkie.com/2105/is-brass-magnetic-what-is-magnetic-brass|title=Is Brass Magnetic?

This often happens when the copper reacts with sulfur to form a brown and eventually black surface layer of [[copper sulfide]] which, if regularly exposed to slightly acidic water such as urban rainwater, can then oxidize in air to form a [[patina]] of green-blue [[copper sulfate]]{{clarification needed|reason=since copper sulfate is freely soluble in water it cannot form a patina where exposed to rainwater|date=January 2020}}. Depending on how the sulfide/ sulfate layer was formed, this layer may protect the underlying brass from further damage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7fCMfvnCKAC&pg=PA119|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Technical Preservation Services|page=119}}</ref>\n\nAlthough copper and zinc have a large difference in [[electrical potential]], the resulting brass alloy does not experience internalized [[galvanic corrosion]] because of the absence of a corrosive environment within the mixture.  However, if brass is placed in contact with a more noble metal such as silver or gold in such an environment, the brass will corrode galvanically; conversely, if brass is in contact with a less-noble metal such as zinc or iron, the less noble metal will corrode and the brass will be protected.\n\n==Lead content==\nTo enhance the machinability of brass, [[lead]] is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower [[melting point]] than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content.

Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.\n\nAn example of DZR brass is the C352 brass, with about 30% zinc, 61-63% copper, 1.7-2.8% lead, and 0.02-0.15% arsenic. The lead and arsenic significantly suppress the zinc loss.<ref>https://www.metalalloyscorporation.com/pdf/c352-dezincification-resistant-brass.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Red brasses\", family of alloys with high copper proportion and generally less than 15% zinc, are more resistant to zinc loss. One of the metals called \"red brass\" is 85% copper, 5% tin, 5% lead, and 5% zinc. Copper Alloy C23000, which is also known as \"red brass\", contains 84\u201386% copper, 0.05% each iron and lead, with the balance being zinc.\n\nAnother such material is [[gunmetal]], from the family of red brasses. Gunmetal alloys contain roughly 88% copper, 8-10% tin, and 2-4% zinc. Lead can be added for ease of machining or for bearing alloys.\n\n\"Naval brass\", for use in seawater, contains 40% zinc but also 1% tin. The tin addition suppresses zinc leaching.\n\nThe [[NSF International]] requires brasses with more than 15% zinc, used in [[piping and plumbing fitting]]s, to be dezincification-resistant.<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/composition-of-common-brass-alloys-2340109</ref>\n\n==Use in musical instruments==\n[[File:Trumpets02262006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A collection of brass instruments]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe high [[Ductility|malleability]] and workability, relatively good resistance to [[corrosion]], and traditionally attributed [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of [[musical instrument]]s whose acoustic [[resonator]]s consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; [[silver]] and its alloys, and even [[gold]], have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. Collectively known as [[brass instrument]]s, these include the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]], and many other \"[[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s\", many in variously-sized families, such as the [[saxhorns]]. \n\nOther [[wind instrument]]s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s are made of some variety of brass, usually a [[cupronickel]] [[alloy]] similar to [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. [[Clarinets]], especially low clarinets such as the [[Contrabass clarinet|contrabass]] and [[Subcontrabass clarinet|subcontrabass]], are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller [[woodwind]]s. For the same reason, some low [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]]s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the [[saxophone]]s and [[sarrusophone]]s are classified as [[woodwind instrument]]s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.\n\nThe keywork of most modern [[woodwind]]s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools\u2014a boon to quick repairs. The [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]s of both [[brass instruments]] and, less commonly, [[woodwind]] instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.\n\nNext to the [[brass instruments]], the most notable use of brass in music is in various [[percussion instrument]]s, most notably [[cymbal]]s, [[gong]]s, and [[chimes|orchestral (tubular) bells]] (large \"church\" [[bell]]s are normally made of [[bronze]]). Small [[handbell]]s and \"[[jingle bell]]\" are also commonly made of brass.\n\nThe [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat \"through\" the shallot in the case of a \"free\" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass. Some parts on [[electric guitars]] are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.\n\n==Germicidal and antimicrobial applications==\n{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\n\n{{See also|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}\n\nThe [[bactericidal]] properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents [[biofouling]].

The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[British Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.\n\n==Brass types==\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Cu Zn.svg|thumb|right|400px|Binary phase diagram]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | Proportion by weight (%)\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n!

Disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from [[Western Europe]] may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th\u20137th centuries AD over 90% of [[copper alloy]] artefacts from [[Egypt]] were made of brass.<ref>Craddock, P.T. La Niece, S.C and Hook, D. (1990) \"Brass in the Medieval Islamic World\" in Craddock, P.T. (ed.) ''2000 Years of Zinc and Brass'' London: British Museum p. 73</ref> However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the [[Islamic]] and [[Byzantine]] world.<ref name=r4/> Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of [[gunmetal]]s and other mixed alloys<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 22</ref> but by about 1000 brass artefacts are found in [[Scandinavia]]n graves in [[Scotland]],<ref name=r24/> brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in [[Northumbria]]<ref>Gilmore, G.R. and Metcalf, D.M (1980) \"The alloy of the Northumbrian coinage in the mid-ninth century\" in Metcalf, D and Oddy, W.

Brass objects are still collectively known as ''dinanderie'' in French.  The [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] in modern [[Belgium]] (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] brass casting, though also often described as bronze.  The metal of the early 12th-century [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, [[nickel]], iron, [[antimony]] and [[arsenic]] with an unusually large amount of [[silver]], ranging from 22.5% in the base to 5.76% in the pan below the candle.  The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins, probably Late Roman.<ref>Noel Stratford, pp. 232, 245, in Zarnecki, George and others; ''English Romanesque Art, 1066\u20131200'', 1984, Arts Council of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0728703866}}</ref>  [[Latten]] is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal, whether of brass or bronze.  [[Aquamanile]]s were typically made in brass in both the European and Islamic worlds.\n[[File:WLA lacma 1250 Aquamanile.jpg|thumb|left|Brass [[aquamanile]] from [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, c. 1250]]\n\nThe cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the [[Islamic world]] seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 224\u20135</ref> Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as ''tutiya'' or [[tutty]] rather than zinc ores for brass-making, resulting in a metal with lower [[iron]] impurities.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, 78</ref> A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century [[Italians|Italian]] [[Marco Polo]] describe how this was obtained by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] from zinc ores and [[Condensation|condensed]] onto [[clay]] or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at [[Hindu Kush|Kush]] in Iran.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, pp. 73\u20136</ref> It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd\u0101n\u012b|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) \"The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe\" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252\u20137</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the \"power\" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176\u20138</ref> \nGerman brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173\u20135</ref>\n\n===Brass in Africa===\n[[File:Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century \"[[Bronze Head from Ife]]\", actually of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\"]]\nSome of the most famous objects in [[African art]] are the [[lost wax]] castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now [[Nigeria]], produced first by the [[Kingdom of Ife]] and then the [[Benin Empire]].  Though normally described as \"bronzes\", the [[Benin Bronzes]], now mostly in the [[British Museum]] and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the [[Bronze Head from Ife]] of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\" and the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=618380 \"The Ife Head\"] on the British Museum collection database. Accessed 26 May 2014</ref>  Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in [[Benin art]] and other West African traditions such as [[Akan goldweights]], where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.\n\n===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95\u2013111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105\u20136</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref>\n\n16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181\u20132, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>\n\nEventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloy]]ed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering,<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref> and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was \"nothing else but unmeltable zinc\" and that zinc was a \"half ripe metal.\"<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198\u20139</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\"/>\n \nHowever, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900\u2013950&nbsp;\u00b0C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226\u20137.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\">Day 1990, p. 131</ref> By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\"/> After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].<ref>Day 1991, pp. 135\u201344</ref> In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.<ref>Day 1990, p. 138</ref> This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 227</ref>\n\nIn 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or \"the English process\".<ref>Day 1991, pp. 179\u201381</ref><ref name=r3/> This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clock]]s, brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\">Day 1991, p. 183</ref> However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\"/> and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].<ref name=r2/> By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc<ref>Day 1991, pp. 186\u20139</ref> as well as demand for [[corrosion]]-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.<ref>Day 1991, pp. 192\u20133, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.

Andrews of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' credited Davidson with being the most memorable performer that season, and its breakout star, which Andrews attributed to Davidson's mining of his personal struggles and his admission of his comedic missteps, which Andrews felt gave the season a mixture of comedy and pathos.<ref name=\"snl44\" />\n\nDavidson collaborated with [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]] to write the song, \"A Message from the Count\" for Kelly's album ''[[Hotel Diablo]]''.\n\nIn February of 2020, Davidson released his stand up special ''Alive from New York'' on Netflix.<ref name=\"2020release\" />\n\n==Comedy style==\nDavidson has been praised for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to \"a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions,\" and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].<ref name=\"db\" /> Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks. He says he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ewrr\" />\n\n==Controversies==\n===Catholic Church comments===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] demanded an apology from Davidson in March, 2019, after an ''SNL'' sketch in which he compared the [[Catholic Church]] to [[R. Kelly]], an entertainer who had been accused of [[pedophilia]]. In the sketch, Davidson said \"(Kelly) is a monster and he should go to jail forever. But if you support the Catholic Church, isn't that like the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I don't really see the difference, except for one's music is significantly better.\"<ref name=\"heil2019\" /> In a statement posted on its website, the diocese criticized the \"disgraceful and offensive skit\", further opining, \"The faithful of our Church are disgusted by the harassment by those in news and entertainment, and this sketch offends millions. The mockery of this difficult time in the Church's history serves no purpose.\"<ref name=\"henderson2019\" />\n\n===Dan Crenshaw comments===\nDavidson was heavily criticized for mocking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressional candidate [[Dan Crenshaw]]'s eye patch, which he wears as a result of an injury suffered while serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL in [[Afghanistan_conflict_(1978\u2013present)#9/11_connection|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"leeman\" /> Davidson compared Crenshaw to \"a hitman in a porno movie\", and added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\"<ref name=\"hill\" /><ref name=\"nw\" /><ref name=\"republic\" /><ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"grappling\" /> \n\nIn response to public outrage over the comments, Crenshaw appeared beside Davidson the following Saturday on an ''SNL'' 'Weekend Update' segment. Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, stating, \"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it was a poor choice of words... the man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\" Crenshaw accepted Davidson's apology and called on Americans to \"never forget\" the service and sacrifices of veterans.<ref name=\"accept\" /> Crenshaw also paid tribute to Davidson's father, a firefighter who had been killed on 9/11.<ref name=\"apology\" /> Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke and the subsequent attention may have helped him win [[Texas's 2nd congressional district]] in the 2018 midterm election.<ref name=\"wapo\" /><ref name=\"esquire\" /> \n\nIn his 2020 [[Netflix]] special ''Alive from New York'', Davidson rescinded the apology previously issued to Crenshaw, implying that it had been issued only because he had been compelled to.<ref name=\"p6apology\" /><ref name=\"hillapology\" /> In the performance, Davidson tells the audience, \"I didn't think I did anything wrong. It was like words that were twisted so that a guy could be famous... So I made fun of this guy with an eye patch and then, like, I kind of got forced to apologize.\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" /> Crenshaw responded by stating that although he had initially hoped that Davidson's apology had been sincere, \"you can never tell with comedians\". Crenshaw added, \"To be fair, if we took everything that comedians said on a Netflix special seriously, man our country would be in a world of hurt. I would like to remember the guy that I saw in person and hung out with that night (on ''SNL'').\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn October 2015, Davidson lived in [[Brooklyn Heights|Brooklyn Heights, New York]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> As of April 2019, he lives in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] with his mother in a home they purchased together.<ref name=\"lonely\" /><ref name=\"ad\" /><ref name=\"mom\" />\n\nHis father was a [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center#Firefighters|firefighter and first-responder]] who died as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nDavidson supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his [[Instagram]] account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his \"hero\", a \"badass\", and \"one of the strongest people in the universe.\" Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, joking, \"This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years.\"<ref name=\"us\" />\n\nBy August 2018, Davidson had over 40&nbsp;tattoos on his arms, legs, chest, hands, and neck.<ref name=\"cosmo\" />\n\nHe was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]] at age 17 or 18,<ref name=\"ht\" /> for which he receives intravenous treatment,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> and used [[medical marijuana]] as a pain reliever.<ref name=\"ht\" /> On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years.<ref name=\"yh\" /> During an interview on comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by [[borderline personality disorder]], for which he has since been undergoing treatment.<ref name=\"wtf\" /><ref name=\"usmag\" />\n\nOn December 15, 2018, Davidson shared a candid [[Instagram]] post in which he expressed thoughts of suicide, before deleting his account on the social media platform entirely.<ref name=\"bully\" /> Concern from [[Ariana Grande]], his friends and Internet users resulted in the [[New York Police Department]] conducting a wellness check on Davidson, who was found safe at the studios for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"account\" /> Davidson only appeared live once on that night's episode of ''SNL'', when he introduced a musical performance by [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Sean Lennon]].<ref name=\"var\" /> Davidson returned to ''SNL'' the following episode, January 19, 2019, and on the ''Weekend Update'' segment he appeared alongside comedian and former ''SNL'' writer [[John Mulaney]] in which they made a reference to his Instagram post.<ref name=\"return\" />\n\n=== Relationships ===\nDavidson dated comedian [[Carly Aquilino]] from 2014 until 2015,<ref name=\"hl\" /> and dated Cazzie David from 2016 to 2018.<ref name=\"people\" /><ref name=\"cut\" /><ref name=\"nylon\" /> On June 20, 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and singer and actress Ariana Grande were engaged to be married.<ref name=\"usat\" /> On October 14, 2018, it was reported that the engagement was called off.<ref name=\"cnn\" /><ref name=\"ewsplit\" /><ref name=\"usa\" /> Grande's song \"[[Pete Davidson (song)|Pete Davidson]]\" appears on her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]''. She also referenced him in her song, \"Thank U, Next\", with the lyric, \"Even almost got married / And for Pete I'm so thankful.\"<ref name=\"thanku\" />Davidson has given many people comfort through his honesty about his struggles with mental and social struggles.\n\nIn January 2019, Davidson was reported to be dating the English actress [[Kate Beckinsale]], but by April they had \u201ccalled time on their romance\u201d.<ref name=\"kb\" />\n\n==Filmography==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Pete Davidson film appearances\n|-\n!

He is a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Davidson has also appeared on the [[MTV]] shows ''[[Guy Code]]'', ''[[Wild 'n Out]]'', and ''[[Failosophy]]''.<ref name=\"mtv\" /><ref name=\"nytfail\" /> He has performed stand-up comedy on ''[[Adam DeVine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', and ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"ew14\" />\n\n==Early life==\nDavidson was born November 16, 1993, in [[Staten Island|Staten Island, New York]], the son of Amy (''n\u00e9e'' Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson.<ref name=\"tvg\" /><ref name=\"sidad\" /> His father was of mostly [[Jewish]] heritage and was born to Carla DiMaggio and raised Catholic, having attended [[Catholic school]] at [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School]]; his [[memorial mass]] was held at St. Clare's Roman Catholic Church in [[Great Kills, Staten Island]]. His mother is of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic.<ref name=\"nyt\" /><ref name=\"bustle\" /> He has a younger sister named Casey.<ref name=\"si\" /><ref name=\"silive\" /> His father was a [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]] who [[Emergency workers killed in the September 11 attacks|died in service]] during the [[September 11 attacks]];<ref name=\"nyp\" /><ref name=\"5things\" /> he was last seen running up the stairs of the [[Marriott World Trade Center]], just before it collapsed. Davidson, then seven years old, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was \"overwhelming\" and that he later acted out in school as a result of the trauma; at one point, he ripped his hair out until he was bald.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In October 2016, Davidson revealed on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'' morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist [[Kid Cudi]] saved his life.<ref name=\"yh\" />\n\nDavidson first tried stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking [[marijuana]].<ref name=\"sfc\" /> Davidson, who has suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he \"cannot function\" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on ''Saturday Night Live'', and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that \"I can perform when I'm not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for me.\"<ref name=\"ht\" /> He attended [[St. Joseph by the Sea High School|St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School]], then [[Tottenville High School]] before transferring to [[Xaverian High School]] in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2012. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at [[St. Francis College]] in [[Brooklyn Heights]];<ref name=\"sidad\" /> after one semester Davidson dropped out to develop his career in comedy.<ref name=\"ew14\" /><ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Career==\nDavidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series ''Failosophy'', which premiered February 28, 2013.<ref name=\"hl\" /> The following month, he appeared in \"PDA and Moms,\" a third-season episode of the [[MTV2]] reality TV comedy series ''[[Guy Code]]'', the first of four episodes in which he was featured.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''Gotham Comedy Live'', which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on ''[[Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out]]'', his first of six episode appearances on that show.\n[[File:Pete Davidson in 2013.jpg|alt=Davidson looking to the side|thumb|right|Davidson in 2013]]\nDavidson subsequently made standup appearances on television and appeared in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.<ref name=\"b99\" /> In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, ''Sober Companion'',<ref name=\"hr\" /> but it ultimately did not make it to series.<ref name=\"dh\" />\n\nDavidson joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"avc\" /> The first new addition to the cast that season,<ref name=\"ew14\" /> Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular [[Bill Hader]], whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 [[Judd Apatow]] feature film comedy ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''.<ref name=\"ewrr\" /> Hader subsequently told producer [[Lorne Michaels]] about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice,<ref name=\"ewrr\" /><ref name=\"ew\" /> with his most noted skits during the season including an ''[[Indiana Jones]]''-style sketch in which he and [[Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]], after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other's various body parts,<ref name=\"sfc\" /><ref name=\"new\" /> an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the [[69 (sex position)|\"69\" position]].<ref name=\"split\" /> Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by [[Norman Reedus]].<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' of [[Justin Bieber]], and his set was praised as one of the best of the show.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster [[Snoop Dogg]] and host [[Kevin Hart]], and their 2004 film ''[[Soul Plane]]''. Davidson, whose firefighter father died responding to the September 11 attacks, called that film \"the worst experience of my life involving a plane.\"<ref name=\"sfc\" />\n\nIn 2016, Davidson was on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 under 30]] list.<ref name=\"forbes\" />  In April of that year, [[Comedy Central]] filmed Davidson's first stand-up special ''Pete Davidson: SMD,'' in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"smd\" />\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that Davidson would be touring with [[John Mulaney]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Massachusetts]] for a limited series of comedy shows titled, \"Sundays with Pete & John.\" Mulaney and Davidson have become close appearing together on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"sundays\" /> That May, after the 44th-season finale of ''SNL'', Travis M. Andrews of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' credited Davidson with being the most memorable performer that season, and its breakout star, which Andrews attributed to Davidson's mining of his personal struggles and his admission of his comedic missteps, which Andrews felt gave the season a mixture of comedy and pathos.<ref name=\"snl44\" />\n\nDavidson collaborated with [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]] to write the song, \"A Message from the Count\" for Kelly's album ''[[Hotel Diablo]]''.\n\nIn February of 2020, Davidson released his stand up special ''Alive from New York'' on Netflix.<ref name=\"2020release\" />\n\n==Comedy style==\nDavidson has been praised for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to \"a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions,\" and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].<ref name=\"db\" /> Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks. He says he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ewrr\" />\n\n==Controversies==\n===Catholic Church comments===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] demanded an apology from Davidson in March, 2019, after an ''SNL'' sketch in which he compared the [[Catholic Church]] to [[R. Kelly]], an entertainer who had been accused of [[pedophilia]]. In the sketch, Davidson said \"(Kelly) is a monster and he should go to jail forever. But if you support the Catholic Church, isn't that like the same thing as being an R. Kelly fan? I don't really see the difference, except for one's music is significantly better.\"<ref name=\"heil2019\" /> In a statement posted on its website, the diocese criticized the \"disgraceful and offensive skit\", further opining, \"The faithful of our Church are disgusted by the harassment by those in news and entertainment, and this sketch offends millions. The mockery of this difficult time in the Church's history serves no purpose.\"<ref name=\"henderson2019\" />\n\n===Dan Crenshaw comments===\nDavidson was heavily criticized for mocking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressional candidate [[Dan Crenshaw]]'s eye patch, which he wears as a result of an injury suffered while serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL in [[Afghanistan_conflict_(1978\u2013present)#9/11_connection|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"leeman\" /> Davidson compared Crenshaw to \"a hitman in a porno movie\", and added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\"<ref name=\"hill\" /><ref name=\"nw\" /><ref name=\"republic\" /><ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"grappling\" /> \n\nIn response to public outrage over the comments, Crenshaw appeared beside Davidson the following Saturday on an ''SNL'' 'Weekend Update' segment. Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, stating, \"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it was a poor choice of words... the man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\" Crenshaw accepted Davidson's apology and called on Americans to \"never forget\" the service and sacrifices of veterans.<ref name=\"accept\" /> Crenshaw also paid tribute to Davidson's father, a firefighter who had been killed on 9/11.<ref name=\"apology\" /> Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke and the subsequent attention may have helped him win [[Texas's 2nd congressional district]] in the 2018 midterm election.<ref name=\"wapo\" /><ref name=\"esquire\" /> \n\nIn his 2020 [[Netflix]] special ''Alive from New York'', Davidson rescinded the apology previously issued to Crenshaw, implying that it had been issued only because he had been compelled to.<ref name=\"p6apology\" /><ref name=\"hillapology\" /> In the performance, Davidson tells the audience, \"I didn't think I did anything wrong. It was like words that were twisted so that a guy could be famous... So I made fun of this guy with an eye patch and then, like, I kind of got forced to apologize.\"<ref name=\"fox02282020\" /> Crenshaw responded by stating that although he had initially hoped that Davidson's apology had been sincere, \"you can never tell with comedians\".
