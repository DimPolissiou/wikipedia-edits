The Hundertwasser House is one of Vienna's most visited buildings and has become part of Austria's cultural heritage.{{sfn|Stallein|2002}}\n\n==Hundertwasser and architecture==\n\nFriedensreich Hundertwasser started out as a painter. Since the early 1950s, however, he increasingly became focused on architecture, writing and reading in public, advocating natural forms of decay. In 1972, he had his first architectural models made for the TV-show \u2018W\u00fcnsch dir was', in order to demonstrate his ideas on forested roofs, \"tree tenants\" and the \"window right\" of every tenant to embellish the facade around his windows. In these models Hundertwasser also developed new architectural shapes, such as the \"eye-slit\" house and the \"high-rise meadow house\".{{sfn|Hundertwasser|2007|page=73}}\n\nIn lectures at academies and before architectural associations, Hundertwasser elucidated his concerns regarding an architecture in harmony with nature and man. [[Bruno Kreisky]], the federal chancellor at the time, suggested in a letter dated November 30, 1977 to Leopold Gratz, the mayor of Vienna, that Hundertwasser be given the opportunity to realize his ideas in the field of architecture by allowing him to build a housing project,{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=160, 161}} whereupon Leopold Gratz, in a letter of December 15, 1977, invited Hundertwasser to create an apartment building according to his own ideas.{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=160, 161}}\n\n<!--The search for a suitable building plot took several years. Because Hundertwasser was not an architect he asked the City of Vienna to provide a professional architect willing to transpose his concepts into architectural drawings.!-->\n\nTo this end, architect Josef Krawina was invited to join the artist and to help him to put his ideas into practice.\n\n==Conflict and cooperation==\n\nIn August and September 1979, architect Krawina presented to Hundertwasser his preliminary drawings and a Styrofoam model. Hundertwasser was shocked and rejected them as representing exactly the leveling, straight-lined modular grid against which he had consistently fought.{{efn|Images in .{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=166-170}}}}\nAs his model of the \u201cTerrace House\u201d for Eurovision showed, he had already conceptualized a quite different type of house.{{sfn|Hundertwasser|2007|page=73}}\n<!--Hundertwasser succeeded in convincing the City of Vienna of the validity of his concept of a forested roof terrace house. However, architect Krawina continued to express skepticism towards these ideas and this prompted the artist to write to the director of the Vienna Magistrate Department 19, architect Kolowrath, asking that architect Krawina be replaced in order that his own ideas be realized. Krawina indeed left the project and architect Peter Pelikan, an employee of the City's Magistratsabteilung 19, took over the planning. Architect Pelikan became Hundertwasser\u2019s long-term partner, working with him on numerous other building projects.!-->\n\nIn the end the house was built between 1983 and 1985 according to the ideas and concepts of Hundertwasser with architect Univ.-Prof. Joseph Krawina as a co-author and architect Peter Pelikan as a planner. It features undulating floors,{{efn|\"an uneven floor is a divine melody to the feet\"{{sfn|Brikcius|2005|page=636}}}} a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows. Hundertwasser took no payment for the design of the house, declaring that it was worth it, to prevent something ugly from going up in its place.\n\nWithin the house there are 53 apartments, four offices, 16 private terraces and three communal terraces, and a total of 250 trees and bushes.\n\n==Court decision==\n\nIn 2001, twenty years after architect Krawina's exit from the project, the firm H.B. Medienvertriebsgesellschaft mbH under its business manager Harald B\u00f6hm encouraged architect Krawina to legally substantiate his claim as co-creator of the \u201cHundertwasser House.\u201d On March 11, 2010, after eight years of litigation, Austria's Oberster Gerichtshof [Supreme Court of Justice] ruled Josef Krawina along with Friedensreich Hundertwasser, to be co-creators of the house with the effect that it is now forbidden for the Hundertwasser Non-Profit Foundation to disseminate any illustration or replica of the house without acknowledging Krawina as co-creator.\n\nAccording to the ruling, Hundertwasser ''was'' the sole ''spiritual creator'' (German: ''Geistiger Sch\u00f6pfer'') of the building, however, Krawina must be recognized as a co-creator of equal standing and be paid an equal share in [[royalties|royalty]] receipts.{{sfn|Kommenda|2010}}\n\n== Pictures ==\n<gallery>\nWien - Hundertwasserhaus (01).JPG|Facade Kegelgasse\nWien - Hundertwasserhaus (02).JPG|Facade L\u00f6wengasse\nHundretWasser.jpg|Fountain\n</gallery>\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!--by publication dates-->\n*{{cite book|title= Das Hundertwasser Haus|first1=Gerhard |last1=Habarta|first2= Wieland |last2=Schmied|location= Wien|publisher= \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesverlag|year= 1985|ref={{sfnref|Habarta, et al |1985}}}}\n*{{cite web|date=2002-01-17 |title=Hundertwasser-Bauwerke: Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten in einem Rausch aus Farben und Formen|publisher=FAZ.NET|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/reise/hundertwasser-bauwerke-sehenswuerdigkeiten-in-einem-rausch-aus-farben-und-formen-151899.html |accessdate=2019-09-03 |language=German|ref={{sfnref|Stallein|2002}}}}\n*{{cite journal |journal=Die entzauberte Idylle|title= \u00d6sterreichische Spazierg\u00e4nge |last=Brikcius |first=Eugen |language=German|isbn=978-3-7001-3261-5|url=http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/?arp=x-coll6dd25/s633-646_brikcius_roth.pdf|format=pdf|date=January 18, 2005|pages=636\u2013646|accessdate=December 18, 2018 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Hundertwasser Architecture: for a More Humane Architecture in Harmony with Nature|first= Friedensreich |last=Hundertwasser|editor= Taschen, Angelika|others= F\u00fcrst, Andrea Christa (documentation); Philip Mattson and Maureen Roycroft Sommer (translators)|isbn= 9783822885642 |oclc= 191258841|location= Hongkong; Los Angeles|publisher= [[Taschen]]|edition=rev|year= 2007|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web|date=May 16, 2010|url=http://diepresse.com/home/recht/rechtallgemein/565439/index.do |title=OGH: Hundertwasser-Haus ist auch von Josef Krawina |first=Benedikt (Die Presse)|last=Kommenda |language=de|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111055230/https://diepresse.com/home/recht/rechtallgemein/565439/OGH_HundertwasserHaus-ist-auch-von-Josef-Krawina|archivedate=January 11, 2011|publisher= [[Die Presse]] |accessdate=December 17, 2018|ref=harv}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Hundertwasserhaus.ogg|2006-01-24}}\n{{Commons category|Hundertwasserhaus Wien|Hundertwasserhaus}}\n* [http://www.hundertwasser-haus.info/en/ Hundertwasser House website by Hundertwasser Foundation] (English)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Landstra\u00dfe]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1985]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Austria]]\n[[Category:Expressionist architecture]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in Austria]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Visionary environments]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|display=title|48|12|26|N|16|23|39|E|region:AT_type:landmark}}\n[[File:Wien - Hundertwasserhaus (03).JPG|thumb|Hundertwasser House Vienna]]\nThe '''Hundertwasserhaus''' is an [[Apartment building|apartment house]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], built after the idea and concept of Austrian artist [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] with architect Joseph Krawina as a co-creator.\n\n== Outline ==\nThis [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]] [[landmark]] of Vienna is located in the [[Landstra\u00dfe|Landstra\u00dfe district]] on the corner of Kegelgasse and L\u00f6wengasse.

[[Bruno Kreisky]], the federal chancellor at the time, suggested in a letter dated November 30, 1977 to Leopold Gratz, the mayor of Vienna, that Hundertwasser be given the opportunity to realize his ideas in the field of architecture by allowing him to build a housing project,{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=160, 161}} whereupon Leopold Gratz, in a letter of December 15, 1977, invited Hundertwasser to create an apartment building according to his own ideas.{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=160, 161}}\n\n<!--The search for a suitable building plot took several years. Because Hundertwasser was not an architect he asked the City of Vienna to provide a professional architect willing to transpose his concepts into architectural drawings.!-->\n\nTo this end, architect Josef Krawina was invited to join the artist and to help him to put his ideas into practice.\n\n==Conflict and cooperation==\n\nIn August and September 1979, architect Krawina presented to Hundertwasser his preliminary drawings and a Styrofoam model. Hundertwasser was shocked and rejected them as representing exactly the leveling, straight-lined modular grid against which he had consistently fought.{{efn|Images in .{{sfn|Habarta, et al|1985|pages=166-170}}}}\nAs his model of the \u201cTerrace House\u201d for Eurovision showed, he had already conceptualized a quite different type of house.{{sfn|Hundertwasser|2007|page=73}}\n<!--Hundertwasser succeeded in convincing the City of Vienna of the validity of his concept of a forested roof terrace house. However, architect Krawina continued to express skepticism towards these ideas and this prompted the artist to write to the director of the Vienna Magistrate Department 19, architect Kolowrath, asking that architect Krawina be replaced in order that his own ideas be realized. Krawina indeed left the project and architect Peter Pelikan, an employee of the City's Magistratsabteilung 19, took over the planning. Architect Pelikan became Hundertwasser\u2019s long-term partner, working with him on numerous other building projects.!-->\n\nIn the end the house was built between 1983 and 1985 according to the ideas and concepts of Hundertwasser with architect Univ.-Prof. Joseph Krawina as a co-author and architect Peter Pelikan as a planner. It features undulating floors,{{efn|\"an uneven floor is a divine melody to the feet\"{{sfn|Brikcius|2005|page=636}}}} a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows. Hundertwasser took no payment for the design of the house, declaring that it was worth it, to prevent something ugly from going up in its place.\n\nWithin the house there are 53 apartments, four offices, 16 private terraces and three communal terraces, and a total of 250 trees and bushes.\n\n==Court decision==\n\nIn 2001, twenty years after architect Krawina's exit from the project, the firm H.B. Medienvertriebsgesellschaft mbH under its business manager Harald B\u00f6hm encouraged architect Krawina to legally substantiate his claim as co-creator of the \u201cHundertwasser House.\u201d On March 11, 2010, after eight years of litigation, Austria's Oberster Gerichtshof [Supreme Court of Justice] ruled Josef Krawina along with Friedensreich Hundertwasser, to be co-creators of the house with the effect that it is now forbidden for the Hundertwasser Non-Profit Foundation to disseminate any illustration or replica of the house without acknowledging Krawina as co-creator.\n\nAccording to the ruling, Hundertwasser ''was'' the sole ''spiritual creator'' (German: ''Geistiger Sch\u00f6pfer'') of the building, however, Krawina must be recognized as a co-creator of equal standing and be paid an equal share in [[royalties|royalty]] receipts.{{sfn|Kommenda|2010}}\n\n== Pictures ==\n<gallery>\nWien - Hundertwasserhaus (01).JPG|Facade Kegelgasse\nWien - Hundertwasserhaus (01).JPG|Facade L\u00f6wengasse\nHundretWasser.jpg|Fountain\n</gallery>\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!--by publication dates-->\n*{{cite book|title= Das Hundertwasser Haus|first1=Gerhard |last1=Habarta|first2= Wieland |last2=Schmied|location= Wien|publisher= \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesverlag|year= 1985|ref={{sfnref|Habarta, et al |1985}}}}\n*{{cite web|date=2002-01-17 |title=Hundertwasser-Bauwerke: Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten in einem Rausch aus Farben und Formen|publisher=FAZ.NET|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/reise/hundertwasser-bauwerke-sehenswuerdigkeiten-in-einem-rausch-aus-farben-und-formen-151899.html |accessdate=2019-09-03 |language=German|ref={{sfnref|Stallein|2002}}}}\n*{{cite journal |journal=Die entzauberte Idylle|title= \u00d6sterreichische Spazierg\u00e4nge |last=Brikcius |first=Eugen |language=German|isbn=978-3-7001-3261-5|url=http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/?arp=x-coll6dd25/s633-646_brikcius_roth.pdf|format=pdf|date=January 18, 2005|pages=636\u2013646|accessdate=December 18, 2018 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Hundertwasser Architecture: for a More Humane Architecture in Harmony with Nature|first= Friedensreich |last=Hundertwasser|editor= Taschen, Angelika|others= F\u00fcrst, Andrea Christa (documentation); Philip Mattson and Maureen Roycroft Sommer (translators)|isbn= 9783822885642 |oclc= 191258841|location= Hongkong; Los Angeles|publisher= [[Taschen]]|edition=rev|year= 2007|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web|date=May 16, 2010|url=http://diepresse.com/home/recht/rechtallgemein/565439/index.do |title=OGH: Hundertwasser-Haus ist auch von Josef Krawina |first=Benedikt (Die Presse)|last=Kommenda |language=de|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111055230/https://diepresse.com/home/recht/rechtallgemein/565439/OGH_HundertwasserHaus-ist-auch-von-Josef-Krawina|archivedate=January 11, 2011|publisher= [[Die Presse]] |accessdate=December 17, 2018|ref=harv}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Hundertwasserhaus.ogg|2006-01-24}}\n{{Commons category|Hundertwasserhaus Wien|Hundertwasserhaus}}\n* [http://www.hundertwasser-haus.info/en/ Hundertwasser House website by Hundertwasser Foundation] (English)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Landstra\u00dfe]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1985]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Austria]]\n[[Category:Expressionist architecture]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in Austria]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings in Vienna]]\n[[Category:Visionary environments]]\n", "name_user": "Bwag", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePictures", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundertwasserhaus"}
{"title_page": "Low impact diving", "text_new": "{{short description|Scuba diving that has minimal environmental effect}}\n'''Low impact diving''' is [[recreational scuba diving]] that is intended to minimise environmental impact by using techniques and procedures that reduce the adverse effects on the environment to the minimum that is reasonably practicable for the situation. To a large extent this is achieved by avoiding contact with sensitive reef life,<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /> but it also applies to diving on [[Archaeology of shipwrecks|historical wrecks]] and in caves with delicate [[speleothem|rock formations]].<ref name=\"GLSPS\" /> It is in the interests of [[Scuba diving tourism|diving tourism service providers]] to help protect the condition of the dive sites on which their businesses rely. They can contribute by encouraging and teaching low impact diving and following best-practice procedures for diving in sensitive areas. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact with the bottom, the most common cause of reef damage.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n\nThe environmental impact of scuba divers has a behavioural component and a skill component. The diver needs to pay attention and actively avoid harmful contact with the surroundings, and it is only possible to do so if the necessary will and competence exist.<ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" /><ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /> Many of the skills are not included in entry level diver training, but they are part of [[Technical diving|technical diver]] training.<ref name=\"BURG\" /> There are also training programmes specifically focused on low impact diving in various environments.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /><ref name=\"GLSPS\" /><ref name=\"BURG\" />\n\n== Scope ==\n\n=== Techniques ===\n\nThe techniques are intended to minimise the effects of recreational scuba diving activities on the environment.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Care is taken during shore entries and exits, paths are used and shore habitats are treated with due care.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Water is entered over sand and gravel where this can allow adjustments and gear checks with least impact. <ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Equipment is rigged and operated to avoid contact with the benthos. No equipment is left to dangle below the diver.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*The divers should be weighted correctly so that neutral buoyancy can be achieved with minimal inflation at any point in the planned dive. (for safety the diver must be able to float at the start and sink at the end of the dive)<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Divers maintain neutral buoyancy throughout the dive to avoid requiring upward thrust to maintain depth, as downward fin-wash will disturb the bottom.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Divers remain aware of their depth and proximity to the bottom, particularly in darkness and low visibility, in tight quarters, and when taking photographs.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Divers check the size of a gap they intend to pass through to ensure that they will not contact sides, bottom, or where it exists, the overhead.<ref name=\"GLSPS\" />\n*If contact with the reef is unavoidable to prevent drift, rock or dead coral is used.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Finning techniques are chosen to minimise risk of contact and fin-wash impingement on sediment or loose objects.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />\n*Contact with living organisms is avoided.<ref name=\"UVNSW\" />  \n*Disturbing and harassment of animals that might affect their natural behaviour is avoided.

Dive guides are commonly certified at [[dive leader|divemaster]] level, which includes [[Rescue diver|rescue skills]] and relatively advanced [[Diver trim|buoyancy control]] skills, so they should generally already have the skills to avoid contact with the bottom, and they are usually familiar with the local environment through experience. Understanding the consequences of contact with sensitive organisms or structures may be lacking. Other skilled divers may exhibit similar behaviour, but be less aware of the local environmental sensitivity.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Competence problems ===\n{{see also|Scuba skills}}\n[[Entry level diver training]] does not routinely put much emphasis on the skills of low impact diving. Most entry level courses are trimmed down to the minimum consistent with acceptable risk to the diver, so that they can be completed in the least time reasonably possible for the average participant.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /><ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" /> A large proportion of recreational divers do not take training that teaches the skills required to effectively limit contact with the solid environment,<ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" /> though this aspect of diving skill is part of most training for diving in overhead environments, where the skills are relevant to diver safety as well as environmental conservation, so the greatest recorded impact is in open water diving in easily accessible and popular but sensitive ecosystems, where fragile and often brittle organisms can be visibly damaged by clumsy and careless divers, and the damage remains obvious over long periods and is seen by many. Tropical coral reefs have received more attention than most other diving environments by researchers, and there are a relatively large number of papers in the literature covering diver impact on these environments.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n\n== Diver training ==\n{{main|Diver training}}\nRecreational diver training has historically followed two philosophies, based on the business structure of the training agencies. The not-for profit agencies tend to focus on developing the diver's competence in relatively fewer stages, and provide more content over a longer programme, then the for-profit agencies, which maximise income and customer convenience by providing a larger number of shorter courses with less content and fewer skills. The more advanced skills and knowledge, including courses focusing on key diving skills like good buoyancy control and trim, and environmental awareness, are available by both routes, but a large number of divers never progress beyond the entry level certification, and only dive on vacation, a system by which skills are more likely to deteriorate than improve due to long periods of inactivity.<ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" />\n\nLow impact diver training programs appear to be effective for a large range of pre-existing skill and certification levels.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /> Similar training from various providers should have similar results. Many of the relevant skills are included in technical diver training, particularly cave and wreck diving,<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /> where they are also important for safety. Refresher courses focused on low impact diving skills and conducted in waters where environmental damage is unlikely can allow tourists who have lost skills through inactivity to regain or improve these skills before venturing into sensitive environments.<ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" />\n\nHaving a neutrally buoyant, horizontally trimmed, body position is the first step to low impact diving. This requires appropriate weighting, accurate buoyancy compensation, and a vertical alignment between the centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity when horizontal.<ref name=\"BURG\" />\n*Correct [[Diving weighting system|weighting]] is a prerequisite for good buoyancy control<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*Good [[Scuba skills#Buoyancy control|buoyancy control]] is needed for level trim<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*Level [[Diver trim|trim]] brings the fins higher above the benthos on most reefs where they are less likely to make direct contact and where fin wash is less likely to impinge on the bottom<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*Appropriate [[Scuba skills#Finning techniques|finning technique]]  chosen should reduce risk of reef impact - It can be selected to suit lateral or vertical proximity to the nearest solid surface<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" /> While neutrally buoyant, the diver can move in the horizontal plane by applying fin thrust only in the horizontal plane. The finning techniques used are all standard techniques used by technical divers and work best with fairly stiff paddle bladed fins:<ref name=\"BURG\" />\n**The frog kick is an energy efficient stroke at low speeds. It directs the fin thrust directly backwards which is useful in silty environments and places with very delicate bottom dwelling organisms. The modified frog kick is a reduced version of the frog kick, with feet raised by bending the knees, suitable for places where there is vulnerable structure to the sides.<ref name=\"BURG\" />\n**The modified flutter kick is based on the regular flutter kick, but with the fins raised above the horizontal by bending the knees, and using small movements of the knees and ankles. Thrust is directed mainly bacwards and the fins remain well above the bottom and have very little sideways movement, so good in narrow spaces.<ref name=\"BURG\" />\n**The reverse kick is very useful, allowing divers to move in reverse, and also useful for positional control, but it only works well with moderately rigid paddle type fins\n**The Helicopter turn is a technique to rotate the diver about a vertical axis on the spot using mainly lower leg and ankle action, also from a horizontal trim with raised feet.<ref name=\"BURG\" />\n*Reduction of dangling equipment - reduces risk of low-hanging items contacting reef when in close proximity<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*[[Situation awareness|Awareness]] of proximity to surroundings - allows avoidance of movements which will result in reef contact, particularly high impact contact<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*Understanding of ecological effects of reef contact - allows avoidance of particularly vulnerable organisms<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n*Adjusting proximity to suit sea conditions - clearance between diver and benthos can be adjusted to allow acceptable risk of contact for variations in surge and current.\n\n=== Diamond Reef System ===\nThe [[Diamond Reef System]] is a safety-based diving curriculum that uses a portable, collapsible underwater obstacle course to simulate a reef or dive wreck structure.<ref name=\"dive training\"></ref>  The program is used to train divers to utilize proper body positioning and safe interaction with coral reefs, fragile marine ecosystems and shipwrecks.<ref name=\"The Art of Diving\"></ref> This program was adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and dive training operations worldwide.<ref name=\"global stamp news\"></ref>\n\n=== PADI Low Impact Diver ===\nThe PADI Low Impact Diver training program is targeted at certi\ufb01ed divers of any experience level. It includes classroom theory, confined water exercises and open water dives over two days. The focus is on buoyancy, streamlining, weighting, trim and propulsion techniques beyond the standard entry level courses of PADI and SSI. Certification requires satisfactory demonstration of the skills in confined and open water. This training is available in parts of the Asia-Pacific region.<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" />\n\n=== BSAC Marine Conservation ===\nThe British Sub-Aqua Club and Big Blue Conservation provide a course to educate divers about problems affecting the marine ecology. The targeted skills are buoyancy control and air consumption improvement. The training is held as a workshop with two buoyancy skills dives. There is an optional certificated extension covering knowledge of the ocean environment, including field identification of marine organisms, and ecological monitoring and conservation dives over a 4 day 5 dive course.<ref name=\"BSAC\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"BSAC\" >{{cite web|url=https://www.bigblueconservation.com/eco-diving-expeditions/specialty-courses/244-bsac-marine-conservation.html |title=BSAC Marine Conservation |website=Big Blue Conservation |accessdate=8 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BURG\" >{{cite web|url=http://burg.org.au/diving.html |title=Low Impact Diving |website=Byron Underwater Research Group |accessdate=8 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hammerton 2014\" >{{cite thesis |publisher=Southern Cross University |date=2014|title=SCUBA-diver impacts and management strategies for subtropical marine protected areas |first=Zan |last=Hammerton |url=https://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1456&context=theses }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Musa and Dimmock 2013\" >{{cite book|title=Scuba Diving Tourism: Contemporary Geographies of Leisure, Tourism and Mobility |last=Johansen |first=Kelsey|editor1-first=Ghazali |editor1-last=Musa |editor2-first=Kay |editor2-last=Dimmock |chapter=Education and training |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=9781136324949}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GLSPS\" >{{cite web|url=https://www.glsps.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=625896&module_id=224798 |title=GLSPS Low Impact Shipwreck Diving Course |website=Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society |accessdate=8 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"UVNSW\" >{{cite web|url=https://www.uvnsw.net.au/low-impact-diving |title=Low Impact Diving |website=Underwater Volunteers, New South Wales |accessdate=8 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dive training\">{{cite news|work=Dive Training|title=The Diamond Reef System|date=December 1992|author=Alex Brylske}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"The Art of Diving\">{{cite book|title=The Art of Diving: And Adventure in the Underwater World|publisher=Globe Pequot|date=September 1, 2007|author1=Nick Hanna|author2=Alexander Mustard}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"global stamp news\">{{cite news|work=The Global Stamp News|title=The World's First Marine Conservation Stamps|date=May 1995|author=Paul Enderle}}</ref> \n\n}}\n{{underwater diving}}\n\n[[Category:Recreational diving]]\n[[Category:Marine conservation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Scuba diving that has minimal environmental effect}}\n'''Low impact diving''' is [[recreational scuba diving]] that is intended to minimise environmental impact by using techniques and procedures that reduce the adverse effects on the environment to the minimum that is reasonably practicable for the situation.

They are much more common and they can, by contrast to larger ones, only be detected when they come very close to the Earth. In most cases this only happens during their final approach. Those impacts therefore will always need a constant watch and they typically cannot be identified earlier than a few weeks in advance, far too late for interception.

The current system consists of two such telescopes operating 160 km apart on [[Haleakala]] and [[Mauna Loa]] in the Hawaiian Islands, ATLAS1 and ATLAS2.<ref name=\"ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa\">ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa, \nAri Heinze [http://blog.fallingstar.com/index.php/2017/02/06/atlas-telescope-2-installed-on-mauna-loa/] Retrieved April 7, 2017.</ref> A major feature of these telescopes is their large 7.4\u00b0 field of view \u2014 about 15 times the diameter of the full moon \u2014 of which their 10 500 \u00d7 10 500 CCD camera images the central 5.4\u00b0 \u00d7 5.4\u00b0. This system can image the whole night sky visible from Hawaii with about 1000 separate telescope pointings. At 30 seconds per exposure plus 10 seconds for readout and simultaneous repointing, each ATLAS telescope can therefore scan the whole visible sky a little over once each night, with a [[median]] completeness limit at [[apparent magnitude]] 19.<ref>[https://fallingstar.com/specifications.php ATLAS Technical Specifications]</ref> Since the mission of the telescope is to identify moving objects, each telescope actually observes one quarter of the sky four times in a night at approximately 15-minute intervals, as needed to automatically link multiple observations of an asteroid into a preliminary orbit and predict its approximate position on subsequent nights. Apparent magnitude 19 is classified as \"respectably but not extremely faint\", and is approximately 100 000 times too faint to be seen with a naked eye from a very dark location. It is equivalent to the light of a match flame in New York viewed from San Francisco. ATLAS therefore scans the visible sky in much less depth, but much more quickly, than larger surveying telescope arrays such as University of Hawaii's [[Pan-STARRS]]. Pan-STARRS goes approximately 100 times deeper, but needs weeks instead of half a night to scan the whole sky just once.<ref name=Astronomy/> This makes ATLAS better suited to finding small asteroids which can only be seen during the just few days that they brighten dramatically when they happen to pass very close to the Earth.\n\nNASA's Near Earth Observation Program initially provided a US$5 million grant, with $3.5 million covering the first three years of design, construction and software development, and the balance of the grant to fund the systems operation for two years following its entry into full operational service in late 2015.<ref name=\"N\u0101 Kilo H\u014dk\u016b-2013.#46\">Oliver, Chris.

The current system consists of two such telescopes operating 160 km apart on [[Haleakala]] and [[Mauna Loa]] in the Hawaiian Islands, ATLAS1 and ATLAS2.<ref name=\"ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa\">ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa, \nAri Heinze [http://blog.fallingstar.com/index.php/2017/02/06/atlas-telescope-2-installed-on-mauna-loa/] Retrieved April 7, 2017.</ref> A major feature of these telescopes is their large 7.4\u00b0 field of view \u2014 about 15 times the diameter of the full moon \u2014 of which their 10 500 \u00d7 10 500 CCD camera images the central 5.4\u00b0 \u00d7 5.4\u00b0. This system can image the whole night sky visible from Hawaii with about 1000 separate telescope pointings. At 30 seconds per exposure plus 10 seconds for readout and simultaneous repointing, each ATLAS telescope can therefore scan the whole visible sky a little over once each night, with a [[median]] completeness limit at [[apparent magnitude]] 19.<ref>[https://fallingstar.com/specifications.php ATLAS Technical Specifications]</ref> Since the mission of the telescope is to identify moving objects, each telescope actually observes one quarter of the sky four times in a night at approximately 15-minute intervals, as needed to automatically link multiple observations of an asteroid into a preliminary orbit and predict its approximate position on subsequent nights. Apparent magnitude 19 is classified as \"respectably but not extremely faint\", and is approximately 100 000 times too faint to be seen with a naked eye from a very dark location. It is equivalent to the light of a match flame in New York viewed from San Francisco. ATLAS therefore scans the visible sky in much less depth, but much more quickly, than larger surveying telescope arrays such as University of Hawaii's [[Pan-STARRS]]. Pan-STARRS goes approximately 100 times deeper, but needs weeks instead of half a night to scan the whole sky just once.<ref name=Astronomy/> This makes ATLAS better suited to finding small asteroids which can only be seen during the just few days that they brighten dramatically when they happen to pass very close to the Earth.\n\nNASA's Near Earth Observation Program initially provided a US$5 million grant, with $3.5 million covering the first three years of design, construction and software development, and the balance of the grant to fund the systems operation for two years following its entry into full operational service in late 2015.<ref name=\"N\u0101 Kilo H\u014dk\u016b-2013.#46\">Oliver, Chris.

FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Franz Rinderer was again voted as the club chairman and this was his fifth consecutive season as club president.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Alwin Riemke]] was appointed as new team manager. He followed [[Richard Kohn|Richard (Dombi) Kohn]] who had moved on to manage [[Feyenoord]]. Riemke came from [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]], who had won the double in the [[1934\u201335 Nationalliga|previous Nationalliga championship season]] and the Cup. Riemke acted as player-manager and played four matches during the season. Basel played a total of 38 matches in their 1935\u201336 season. 26 of these matches were in the Nationalliga, one in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 11 were friendly matches. Of these 11 friendlies six were played at home and the others all in Switzerland. Interesting visitors to the [[Landhof]] were the French teams [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]], [[Excelsior AC Roubaix]] and [[Olympique Lillois]], the Hungarian teams [[MTK Budapest FC|MTK Budapest]] and [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] and the Austrian team [[Wiener AC]]. Of theses 11 friendly matches seven ended with a victory, one was drawn and three ended in a defeat.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz Saison 1935/36\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1935/36 | title = Bilanz Saison 1935/36 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1935\u201336 Nationalliga]] was contested by 14 teams and was played in a double round robin. Basel played a very mediocre season and ended the championship in 10th position. They won just eight of their 26 games and with 20 points ended the season 21 points behind [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]] who won the championship for the second consecutive season. [[Josef Artimovicz]] was Basel's top scorer with 14 goals, [[Alfred Jaeck|Jaeck]] second best scorer with 9 goals.\n\nIn the 1st principal round of the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn at home in the [[Landhof]] against lower tier [[FC Luzern|Luzern]]. But they were defeated and thus knocked out. [[SC Young Fellows Juventus|Young Fellows Z\u00fcrich]] won the cup.<ref name=\"rsssf-Switzerland-1935/36\">{{cite web | first = | last = Erik Garin | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwit36.html | title = Switzerland 1935/36 | format = | work = | publisher = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\n== Players ==\nThe following is the list of the Basel first team squad during the season 1935\u201336.
