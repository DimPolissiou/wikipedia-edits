In the beta version, the game was called \"Geometry Jump\", but was later changed to \"Geometry Dash\".\n\nUpon its release, ''Geometry Dash'' had just seven levels, which are now currently free to play on the game's free version, alongside six other levels released in later updates in the full version.

The first inhabitants were prisoners sentenced by minor crimes; 50 years after it was established the population of the parish was little more than ten families.\n\nThe village was frequently attacked by pirates, and destroyed completely in 1590, resulting in the construction of fortress, around 1602: the Fort of S\u00e3o Clemente ({{lang-pt|Forte de S\u00e3o Clemente}}), which was constructed between 1599 and 1602 (during the reign of King [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]]).\n\nDuring the 19th century, the parish was integrated into the municipality of Odemira, during the administrative reforms of [[Mouzinho da Silveira]].\n\nVila Nova do Milfontes was involved in Portuguese aviation, being one of the first points between Portugal and Macau, completed by Brito Paes (a citizen of Colos in Vila Nova de Milfontes) and Sarmento Beires. On 7 April 1924, these pilots left Campo dos Coitos, near Milfontes on their voyage to the Far East. In homage to the aviators and their historic flight, in the ''Pra\u00e7a da Barbac\u00e3'' (alongside the fort), a monument was erected to mark their voyage.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:V. Nova de Milfontes.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The coastal beach with the main centre of Vila Nova de Milfontes in the background]]\nVila Nova de Milfontes is located along the western coast of [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the northern margin of the [[Mira River, Portugal|Mira River]], falling within the [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park|Nature Park of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast]]. Vila Nova de Milfontes is dominated by a large estuary and ecosystem, dominated by the Mira River that gives shelter to several species of birds and marine life, in addition to wild boar and fox in the surrounding woods.\n\n===Beaches===\nThere are several beaches near the urban areas that regularly attract tourists:\n* Malh\u00e3o \n* Praia da Franquia (also known as ''Praia do Rio'')\n* Furnas\n* Aivados\n* Ribeira da Azenha\n* Foz\n\n==Economy==\nAlong the river, the small fishing port is still maintained, provide a small source of income. In fact, the region has developed an aquaculture centre nearby in Moinho da Asneira.\n\nMoreover, sport fishing, diving, pedestrian trails, horse trails and all-terrain sports are promoted for amateur tourists, supported by a local service economy designed on tourism. Moreover, the surrounding area offers [[ecological tourism]], [[paragliding]] training, a small [[safari park]] and beautiful hideouts with small [[waterfall]]s. The tourist-oriented town, with only a small population, annually becomes inflated during the summer and holiday seasons, tourists attracted by the white sand beaches, clear water and landscape.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* Ant\u00f3nio Jacinto da Silva Brito Pais (Colos, 15 July 1884 - 22 February 1934), military officer and pilot; Brito Pais joined the ''Escola do Ex\u00e9rcito'' in 1907, becoming an infantryman and serving in the 5th Battalion and Niassa company, before returning to Portugal in 1912 (due to illness). He participated in combat in World War One, with the 15th Infantry of the ''Corpo Expedicionario de Portugal'' (''Portuguese Expeditionary Corp''), where he received the War Cross and French [[Legion of Honour]]. At the end of the War he was assigned the command of the ''Bombardment and Observation Squadron'' of the ''Republic Aviation Squadron'', and in 1920, along with Sarmento Beires, made an attempt to link Madeira by air. In 1924, along with Sarmento Beires and Manuel Gouveia, they completed the first air voyage between Portugal and Macau, in their airplane ''\u201cP\u00e1tria\u201d'', which departed Vila Nova de Milfontes.\n* Cust\u00f3dio Br\u00e1s Pacheco (1828-1883), politician, journalist and association leader; Pacheco, a tobacco factory worker in Lisbon, in 1878 he became a candidate for the [[Republican Party (Portugal)|Republican Party]] during that year's elections.

The first inhabitants were prisoners sentenced by minor crimes; 50 years after it was established the population of the parish was little more than ten families.\n\nThe village was frequently attacked by pirates, and destroyed completely in 1590, resulting in the construction of fortress, around 1602: the Fort of S\u00e3o Clemente ({{lang-pt|Forte de S\u00e3o Clemente}}), which was constructed between 1599 and 1602 (during the reign of King [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]]).\n\nDuring the 19th century, the parish was integrated into the municipality of Odemira, during the administrative reforms of [[Mouzinho da Silveira]].\n\nVila Nova do Milfontes was involved in Portuguese aviation, being one of the first points between Portugal and Macau, completed by Brito Paes (a citizen of Colos in Vila Nova de Milfontes) and Sarmento Beires. On 7 April 1924, these pilots left Campo dos Coitos, near Milfontes on their voyage to the Far East. In homage to the aviators and their historic flight, in the ''Pra\u00e7a da Barbac\u00e3'' (alongside the fort), a monument was erected to mark their voyage.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:V. Nova de Milfontes.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The coastal beach with the main centre of Vila Nova de Milfontes in the background]]\nVila Nova de Milfontes is located along the western coast of [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the northern margin of the [[Mira River, Portugal|Mira River]], falling within the [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park|Nature Park of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast]]. Vila Nova de Milfontes is dominated by a large estuary and ecosystem, dominated by the Mira River that gives shelter to several species of birds and marine life, in addition to wild boar and fox in the surrounding woods.\n\n===Beaches===\nThere are several beaches near the urban areas that regularly attract tourists:\n* Malh\u00e3o \n* Praia da Franquia (also known as ''Praia do Rio'')\n* Furnas\n* Aivados\n* Ribeira da Azenha\n* Foz\n\n==Economy==\nAlong the river, the small fishing port is still maintained, provide a small source of income. In fact, the region has developed an aquaculture centre nearby in Moinho da Asneira.\n\nMoreover, sport fishing, diving, pedestrian trails, horse trails and all-terrain sports are promoted for amateur tourists, supported by a local service economy designed on tourism. Moreover, the surrounding area offers [[ecological tourism]], [[paragliding]] training, a small [[safari park]] and beautiful hideouts with small [[waterfall]]s. The tourist-oriented town, with only a small population, annually becomes inflated during the summer and holiday seasons, tourists attracted by the white sand beaches, clear water and landscape.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* Ant\u00f3nio Jacinto da Silva Brito Pais (Colos, 15 July 1884 - 22 February 1934), military officer and pilot; Brito Pais joined the ''Escola do Ex\u00e9rcito'' in 1907, becoming an infantryman and serving in the 5th Battalion and Niassa company, before returning to Portugal in 1912 (due to illness). He participated in combat in World War One, with the 15th Infantry of the ''Corpo Expedicionario de Portugal'' (''Portuguese Expeditionary Corp''), where he received the War Cross and French [[Legion of Honour]]. At the end of the War he was assigned the command of the ''Bombardment and Observation Squadron'' of the ''Republic Aviation Squadron'', and in 1920, along with Sarmento Beires, made an attempt to link Madeira by air. In 1924, along with Sarmento Beires and Manuel Gouveia, they completed the first air voyage between Portugal and Macau, in their airplane ''\u201cP\u00e1tria\u201d'', which departed Vila Nova de Milfontes.\n* Cust\u00f3dio Br\u00e1s Pacheco (1828-1883), politician, journalist and association leader; Pacheco, a tobacco factory worker in Lisbon, in 1878 he became a candidate for the [[Republican Party (Portugal)|Republican Party]] during that year's elections. In 1879, he founded the newspaper ''A Voz do Oper\u00e1rio'', which later gave rise to the ''Sociedade A Voz do Oper\u00e1rio'' (later the ''Sociedade de Instru\u00e7\u00e3o e Benefic\u00eancia \u201cA Voz do Oper\u00e1rio\u201d'').

It developed most likely from a preexistent [[Celt]]ic [[Castro (village)|Castro]], or Neolithic settlement. The origin of the name Cale<ref>http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=Cala</ref> (or Gale, since in Classical [[Latin]] there was not always a clear distinction between the letters \"g\" and \"c\") is likely [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], from the root \"Gall-\" with which Celts referred to themselves, similarly to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Gaul]] or [[Galway]]. \nThe river itself has a Celtic name, [[Douro]] (Latinised Durus) after Celtic \"dwr\", deep water, water or river.<ref>^ Matasovi\u0107, Ranko (2009), \u201c*dubro-\u201d, in Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series; 9), Leiden: Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17336-1}}, pages 107-108</ref><ref>^ Wodtko, Dagmar S.; Irslinger, Britta; Schneider, Carolin (2008), \u201c*d\u02b0eu\u032fb-\u201d, in Nomina im indogermanischen Lexikon [Nouns in the Indo-European Lexicon] (in German), Heidelberg: Universit\u00e4tsverlag Winter, pages 122-124</ref> In Roman times the bulk of the population probably lived south of the river Douro, and on the north side, there was a smaller settlement around the deep water port which now is the [[Ribeira Square|Ribeira]] neighbourhood of [[Porto]]. The name of Porto, in high medieval times [[Portus Cale]], thus stood for the harbour (\"portus\" in Latin) of the city of Cale. With the important trade of the river Douro, which is easily navigable up to the [[R\u00e9gua]] deep inland, the Porto part of the city came to overgrow Cale, and became the most important part of town, where the Bishopric and the merchants were established.\n[[File:Vila Nova de Gaia - Historic Section.jpg|thumb|The historic section on the river]]\nWith the Moorish invasions in the eighth century, the ''de facto'' frontier between the Islamic state and the Christian one came to rest for a considerable period of time on the river Douro. With the constant raids and counter-raids, the town of Cale, or Gaia, was deserted and most of its inhabitants took refuge in Porto in the North side of the river. It is in this period, the tenth century, that the late medieval ''[[Lenda de Gaia]]'' (Legend of Gaia) is set.\nAfter the conquest and pacification of the southern side of the Douro river after 1035, with the exodus or expulsion of the Muslim populations, leaving behind semi-abandoned fertile lands, colonists from the north settled in exchange for better [[feudal]] contracts with the newly appointed lords. These migrants refounded the old city of Cale or Gaia under the name of Vila Nova de Gaia (new town of Gaia) around the old [[castle]] and ruins of \"old Gaia\".\n\nThe name of the double city of Porto and Gaia was frequently referred to in contemporary documents as \"villa de [[Portus Cale|Portucale]]\", and the county of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] which was centered on it was named [[Condado Portucalense]]. This county was eventually expanded and after gaining its independence, became the [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\n==Parishes==\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 15 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 134-135|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2014|author=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica|language=Portuguese|author-link=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It developed most likely from a preexistent [[Celt]]ic [[Castro (village)|Castro]], or Neolithic settlement. The origin of the name Cale<ref>http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=Cala</ref> (or Gale, since in Classical [[Latin]] there was not always a clear distinction between the letters \"g\" and \"c\") is likely [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], from the root \"Gall-\" with which Celts referred to themselves, similarly to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Gaul]] or [[Galway]]. \nThe river itself has a Celtic name, [[Douro]] (Latinised Durus) after Celtic \"dwr\", deep water, water or river.<ref>^ Matasovi\u0107, Ranko (2009), \u201c*dubro-\u201d, in Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series; 9), Leiden: Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17336-1}}, pages 107-108</ref><ref>^ Wodtko, Dagmar S.; Irslinger, Britta; Schneider, Carolin (2008), \u201c*d\u02b0eu\u032fb-\u201d, in Nomina im indogermanischen Lexikon [Nouns in the Indo-European Lexicon] (in German), Heidelberg: Universit\u00e4tsverlag Winter, pages 122-124</ref> In Roman times the bulk of the population probably lived south of the river Douro, and on the north side, there was a smaller settlement around the deep water port which now is the [[Ribeira Square|Ribeira]] neighbourhood of [[Porto]]. The name of Porto, in high medieval times [[Portus Cale]], thus stood for the harbour (\"portus\" in Latin) of the city of Cale. With the important trade of the river Douro, which is easily navigable up to the [[R\u00e9gua]] deep inland, the Porto part of the city came to overgrow Cale, and became the most important part of town, where the Bishopric and the merchants were established.\n[[File:Vila Nova de Gaia - Historic Section.jpg|thumb|The historic section on the river]]\nWith the Moorish invasions in the eighth century, the ''de facto'' frontier between the Islamic state and the Christian one came to rest for a considerable period of time on the river Douro. With the constant raids and counter-raids, the town of Cale, or Gaia, was deserted and most of its inhabitants took refuge in Porto in the North side of the river. It is in this period, the tenth century, that the late medieval ''[[Lenda de Gaia]]'' (Legend of Gaia) is set.\nAfter the conquest and pacification of the southern side of the Douro river after 1035, with the exodus or expulsion of the Muslim populations, leaving behind semi-abandoned fertile lands, colonists from the north settled in exchange for better [[feudal]] contracts with the newly appointed lords. These migrants refounded the old city of Cale or Gaia under the name of Vila Nova de Gaia (new town of Gaia) around the old [[castle]] and ruins of \"old Gaia\".\n\nThe name of the double city of Porto and Gaia was frequently referred to in contemporary documents as \"villa de [[Portus Cale|Portucale]]\", and the county of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] which was centered on it was named [[Condado Portucalense]]. This county was eventually expanded and after gaining its independence, became the [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\n==Parishes==\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 15 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 134-135|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2014|author=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica|language=Portuguese|author-link=Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
