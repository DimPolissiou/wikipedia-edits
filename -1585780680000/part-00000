(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[film|motion picture]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925), as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

On February 27, 1801, a year after moving from the temporary National Capital at [[Philadelphia]] to the [[Washington, D.C.|City of Washington]], the [[United States Congress]] organized the area as a subdivision of the District named '''Alexandria County'''. In 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned the land]] southwest of the Potomac River donated by Virginia due to issues involving [[District of Columbia voting rights|Congressional representation]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The [[General Assembly of Virginia]] changed the county's name to Arlington in 1920 to avoid confusion with the adjacent [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]]. --> \nDue to the county's proximity to downtown Washington, D.C., Arlington is home to [[the Pentagon]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National Airport]], and [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Land grants from the British monarch were awarded to prominent Englishmen in exchange for political favors and efforts at development. One of the grantees was [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who lends his name to both Fairfax County and the [[Fairfax, Virginia|City of Fairfax]]. The county's name \"Arlington\" comes via [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Henry Bennet]], [[Earl of Arlington]], a [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]] along the Potomac River, and [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the family residence on that property. [[George Washington Parke Custis]], grandson of First Lady [[Martha Washington]], acquired this land in 1802. The estate was eventually passed down to [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], wife of General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/willofgeorgewashingtonparkecustis.htm |title=Will of George Washington Parke Custis |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> The property later became [[Arlington National Cemetery]] during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually lent its name to present-day Arlington County.\n\n===Alexandria County, District of Columbia (D.C.)===\n\nThe area that now contains Arlington County was ceded to the new United States federal government by Virginia. With the passage of the [[Residence Act]] in 1790, Congress approved a new permanent capital to be located on the [[Potomac River]], the exact area to be selected by U.S. President [[George Washington]]. The Residence Act originally only allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as what is now the [[Anacostia River]]. However, President Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast in order to include the pre-existing city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip.\n\nIn 1791, Congress, at Washington's request, amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including the territory ceded by Virginia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb|author3=John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

From 1840 to 1846, Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature to approve this transfer known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]]. On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789\u20131901#1841 to 1851|Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846]], to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President [[James K. Polk]] signed the legislation the next day. A referendum on retrocession was held on September 1\u20132, 1846. The voters in the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116, while those in the rest of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in rural Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer. Virginia legislators were concerned that the people of Alexandria County had not been properly included in the retrocession proceedings. After months of debate, the Virginia General Assembly voted to formally accept the retrocession legislation on March 13, 1847.<ref name=debates />\n\nIn 1852, the Virginia legislature voted to incorporate a portion of Alexandria County to make the City of Alexandria, which until then had been considered politically as a town only.<ref name=\"Incorporation_of_Alexandria\">{{cite web| url= http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html#history| title= Alexandria's History| accessdate= August 30, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829220638/http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html#history| archivedate= August 29, 2006| url-status= dead| df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:12-07-15-arlington-friedfhof-RalfR-026.jpg|thumbnail|Arlington National Cemetery sits on land confiscated from Confederate General [[Robert E.

Because of the confusion between the city and the county having the same name, a movement started to rename Alexandria County. In 1920, the name '''Arlington County''' was adopted, after [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the home of the [[American Civil War]] Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]], which stands on the grounds of what is now [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The [[Potomac, Virginia|Town of Potomac]] was incorporated as a town in Alexandria County in 1908. The town was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in 1930.\n\nIn 1896, an electric trolley line was built from Washington through Ballston, which led to growth in the county (see [[Northern Virginia trolleys]]).\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Seal of Arlington County, Virginia (1983\u20132007).png|thumb|upright|left|The former Arlington County seal, used from June 1983 to May 2007]]\n\nIn 1920, the Virginia legislature renamed the area Arlington County to avoid confusion with the City of Alexandria which had become an [[independent city]] in 1870 under the new Virginia Constitution adopted after the Civil War.\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Hoover Field]] was established on the present site of the Pentagon; in that decade, Buckingham, Colonial Village, and other apartment communities also opened.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in 1954, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka'', Kansas had struck down the previous ruling on racial segregation ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' that held that facilities could be racially \"separate but equal.\" ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruled that \"racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal.\" The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools. The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation. Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation. Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958\u201359 academic year. In January 1959 both the U.S. District Court and the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled against Virginia's [[massive resistance]] movement, which opposed racial integration.<ref>Les Shaver, \"Crossing the Divide: The Desegregation of Stratford Junior High,\" ''Arlington Magazine'' November/December 2013, pp. 62\u201371</ref> The Arlington County Central Library's collections include written materials as well as accounts in its Oral History Project of the desegregation struggle in the county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/virginiana-collection/|title=Virginiana Collection|publisher=Arlington Public Library |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:US Navy 061013-F-3500C-443 View over the U.S. Navy Annex, showing the completed U.S. Air Force memorial.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The former [[Navy Annex]] and the [[United States Air Force Memorial|Air Force Memorial]]]]\nArlington during the 1960s was undergoing tremendous change after the huge influx of newcomers in the 1950s.

Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.<ref>Kevin Craft, \"When Metro Came to Town: How the fight for mass transit was won.

State Senators are elected for four-year terms, while Delegates are elected for two-year terms.\n\nIn the Virginia State Senate, Arlington is split between the 30th and 31st districts, represented by [[Adam Ebbin]] and [[Barbara Favola]], respectively. In the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], Arlington is divided between the 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th districts, represented by [[Mark Levine (journalist)|Mark Levine]], [[Patrick A. Hope|Patrick Hope]], [[Rip Sullivan]], and [[Alfonso H. Lopez|Alfonso Lopez]], respectively.  All are Democrats.\n\nAt the presidential level, Arlington was once a fairly reliable GOP stronghold, supporting the Republican candidate in all but two elections from 1944 to 1980.  However, in 1984, Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] carried the county by a narrow margin, despite Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral landslide nationally.  It has gone Democratic in every presidential election since then. In fact, in 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] received the fewest raw votes of a major-party candidate in the county since [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in 1956, in addition to receiving the lowest proportion of Arlington's vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate in the past century. Arlington is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Don Beyer]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.\n\nArlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a \"treasury\" of Washington heirlooms.\n\nIn 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.\n\nWhen George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].\n\nThe U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.\n\nVeterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.\n\nThe [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an \"Eternal Flame.\" His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.\n\nOther frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the \"Iwo Jima Memorial\", the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].\n\n===The Pentagon===\n[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|The Pentagon, looking northeast with the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington Monument]] in the distance.]]\n\n{{Main|The Pentagon}}\n[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943 and it is the world's largest office building.

It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.\n\nBuilt during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has {{convert|17.5|mi|abbr=on}} of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.\n\nIt was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m\u00b3) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.\n\nThe open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest \"no-salute, no-cover\" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].\n\nDuring World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943 and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transportation==\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect [[Transportation in Arlington County, Virginia]] -->\n[[File:2019-06-26 11 51 06 View south along Interstate 395 (Henry G.

On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved.

The voters in the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116, while those in the rest of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in rural Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer.

Board of Education'' ruled that \"racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal.\" The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools. The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation. Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation. Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958\u201359 academic year.

Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and now is a vibrant urban village.

State Senators are elected for four-year terms, while Delegates are elected for two-year terms.\n\nIn the Virginia State Senate, Arlington is split between the 30th and 31st districts, represented by [[Adam Ebbin]] and [[Barbara Favola]], respectively. In the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], Arlington is divided between the 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th districts, represented by [[Mark Levine (journalist)|Mark Levine]], [[Patrick A. Hope|Patrick Hope]], [[Rip Sullivan]], and [[Alfonso H. Lopez|Alfonso Lopez]], respectively.  All are Democrats.\n\nAt the presidential level, Arlington was once a fairly reliable GOP stronghold, supporting the Republican candidate in all but two elections from 1944 to 1980.  However, in 1984, Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] carried the county by a narrow margin, despite Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral landslide nationally.  It has gone Democratic in every presidential election since then. In fact, in 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] received the fewest raw votes of a major-party candidate in the county since [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in 1956, in addition to receiving the lowest proportion of Arlington's vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate in the past century. Arlington is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Don Beyer]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.\n\nArlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a \"treasury\" of Washington heirlooms.\n\nIn 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.\n\nWhen George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].\n\nThe U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.\n\nVeterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.\n\nThe [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an \"Eternal Flame.\" His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.\n\nOther frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the \"Iwo Jima Memorial\", the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].\n\n===The Pentagon===\n[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|The Pentagon, looking northeast with the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington Monument]] in the distance.]]\n\n{{Main|The Pentagon}}\n[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943 and it is the world's largest office building. Although it is located in Arlington, the [[United States Postal Service]] requires that \"Washington, D.C.\" be used as the place name in mail addressed to the six [[ZIP code]]s assigned to The Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html |title=Facts & Figures: Zip Codes |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311141422/http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html|archivedate=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe building is [[pentagon]]-shaped and houses about 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel. It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.\n\nBuilt during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has {{convert|17.5|mi|abbr=on}} of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.\n\nIt was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m\u00b3) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.\n\nThe open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest \"no-salute, no-cover\" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].\n\nDuring World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943 and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transportation==\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect [[Transportation in Arlington County, Virginia]] -->\n[[File:2019-06-26 11 51 06 View south along Interstate 395 (Henry G.

She made her first appearance on 11 May 2006 and temporarily left ''EastEnders'' in early 2008 to give birth to her second child. Her exit coincided with the departure of [[Matt Di Angelo]] ([[Dean Wicks]]) and permanent departures of cast members [[Phil Daniels]] ([[Kevin Wicks]]), [[Kellie Shirley]] ([[Carly Wicks]]). She returned to Walford on 6 June 2008. This is Parish's second role in ''EastEnders'', as she previously played singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.\n\nIntroduced as a single mother to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) who has come from an abusive marriage, Denise has gone on to marry two additional times. Firstly, to Kevin in 2007, who dies months later, and then to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) in 2009, with them divorcing two years later after he is imprisoned for murder. She also embarks on a loveless engagement to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), flings with younger men [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and a drunken one-night stand with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) which results in a [[Advanced maternal age|late in life pregnancy]]. Denise's third child, a son, is born in 2017, but she gives him up for adoption, shortly before her mother tells her she is adopted herself (although this was later proved untrue). Other storylines involving Denise include surviving a bus crash, losing her job, descending into poverty and a relationship with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]).\n\n==Storylines==\nMoving to Walford, Denise has a tempestuous encounter with [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]); however, an attraction develops and they begin dating. Denise's former husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), an alcoholic, tries to reunite with their daughter, [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) and he later kidnaps her. He tries to drown himself and Libby but she recovers and Owen is arrested. Denise, who never knew her father but knows he played in a band called \"The Five Hectors\", thinks that [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) may be her father as he was in the band but a DNA test proves that he is not. The band also consisted of [[Aubrey Valentine]] ([[Joseph Marcell]]), [[Cedric Lucas]] ([[Ram John Holder]]), Dwight and Earl. The identity of Denise's father is never discovered, but Aubrey also eliminates himself.\n\nWhen Kevin's former wife, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), arrives in Walford, she causes problems for Denise and Kevin. Shirley reveals Kevin's secret, that he is not [[Dean Wicks|Deano]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and [[Carly Wicks|Carly]]'s ([[Kellie Shirley]]) biological father. After Shirley tells everyone this, Kevin flees. Upset, Denise threatens to move away but stays when Kevin returns and proposes marriage. Shirley unsuccessfully tries to ruin the wedding and Denise deals with various problems, including Chelsea and Dean's imprisonment for framing [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), Kevin's attempts to conceal the crime, and a feud with her boss at the post office, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). Kevin starts selling cars for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), but discovers they are [[Lemon (automobile)|cut-and-shut]]s; he tries to destroy the cars but dies in an accident. Denise and Carly leave Walford after the funeral, seeking the right place to scatter Kevin's ashes.\n\nDenise returns, but is angry to discover her daughter [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) is using drugs and in contact with her father, former drug addict [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Denise is initially hostile but she warms to him when she sees he has changed and they eventually reunite. Denise proposes to Lucas but he is married to [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]). Trina attempts to seduce Lucas but he accidentally kills her. Denise helps Jordan come to terms with his mother's death, with them believing it to be an overdose. With Trina dead, Denise and Lucas are able to marry, though further complications arise when Owen is released from prison. He desperately tries to show Denise that she cannot trust Lucas but they marry regardless. Lucas kills Owen on their wedding day and his body is discovered eight months later. Lucas confesses to Denise, claiming self-defence. At first, she agrees to protect him but convinces him to go to the police. However, he instead drives her to a canal. When she refuses to submit to God, he strangles her. He murders a prostitute, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Gemma|Gemma]] (Rita Balogun), and identifies her as Denise, her family believing she committed suicide. Lucas keeps Denise prisoner in the house next door but she escapes after a few weeks and Lucas is arrested, later sentenced to life imprisonment. Chelsea, needing a fresh start, moves to Spain with Owen's mother, [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]) and Libby joins them for a holiday before returning to university. Denise is heartbroken to see her girls leave but is distracted by her sister, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]), arriving and saying that she has left her boyfriend, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), and asks to move in with them.\n\nKim and Denise later buy the house next door and open a [[bed and breakfast]]. Denise talks to Zainab, who helps her move on by destroying memories of Lucas. Denise starts dating [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), Zainab's former husband, but ends it after realising he is still in love with Zainab. On Christmas Day 2011, Denise opens a present containing a broken toy car and a USB stick with a recording of Phil talking about his part in Kevin's death. Horrified, Denise calls Phil a murderer and tries to get him arrested but fails to do so.\n\nYusef starts a fire at the bed and breakfast, damaging it so badly that Denise, Kim and Patrick are forced to move out. The insurance company refuse to pay out as it was arson so Patrick gives Denise and Kim the Minute Mart but Zainab gives them Yusef's money so they can rebuild the bed and breakfast. When the B&B opens, Denise is angry that Kim simply flirts with the customers, leaving all the work to her. They have an argument and Denise quits but returns on the condition that Kim puts in more effort. When Zainab's brother-in-law. [[AJ Ahmed]] ([[Phaldut Sharma]]), arrives in Walford, he attempts to con Denise but fails. The two later have drinks but AJ leaves. Denise attends [[Christian Clarke]]'s ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) stag party where a man gives her unwanted attention. She has sex with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) when he defends her from an overly-persistent interest and allows him to walk her home. The next day, Denise is embarrassed and tells Fatboy it was a mistake. However, it is revealed she has feelings for Fatboy and after she welcomes him into her home, they have sex again. Denise agrees to pursue a secret relationship with Fatboy. When Fatboy tries to encourage her to make their relationship public, Denise calls it off, telling Fatboy she will treasure the memory of their time together. After a lonely Christmas, Kim and Zainab decide to set up a date for her. However, this fails and when Kim's boyfriend [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) comforts her, they share a kiss. Ray tells Kim about it but says Denise made the first move, so Kim slaps Denise and says she is dead to her. Denise and Kim reconcile until Ray ends his relationship with Kim. Kim blames Denise so Denise stays with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). When Ray tells Kim the truth, Denise and Kim reconcile and Denise moves back in with Kim.\n\nWhen Denise and Ian get locked in the Minute Mart's storage cupboard and share a kiss, it leads to a relationship. This becomes public, thanks to Ian's daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Denise helps Ian open a restaurant and supports him when [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) threatens and blackmails him. Denise moves in with Ian and his children and are joined by [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]), daughter of Ian's dead former wife. Denise begins to feel part of the family and supports Ian when he intends to testify that he saw [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. However, Ian fails to do this and Denise is devastated to learn that Ian was intending to lie to frame Max on Carl's orders. The return of Ian's former wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), causes Denise to have doubts about their relationship. She accepts Ian's marriage proposal and during their engagement party, she shares a kiss with Fatboy. They come to their senses when they are caught by [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). Fatboy's girlfriend, [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), learns of the kiss and posts a letter to Ian, before leaving Walford but Lucy reads it and challenges Denise. For the sake of her father's mental health, Lucy agrees to keep it a secret. Denise and Ian drift apart due to his busy lifestyle. After visiting Libby in Oxford, she plans to leave Ian. However, when Lucy is murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), Denise feels forced to stay and support him. Denise is sidelined by Ian and decides to leave, confiding in Patrick that she feels trapped. However, worried that she will look like a bad person, Denise changes her mind and returns but still feels ostracised. She does not attend Lucy's funeral after seeing Ian and Jane comforting one another. Under advice from Libby, Denise tells Ian she can no longer be with him but he begs her to stay. Denise agrees to stay when Ian admits he has taken her for granted and encourages her to go with Libby to Spain to celebrate Chelsea's birthday.\n\nOn Denise's return, things are much better between her and Ian and he arranges for them to visit Libby in Oxford for a weekend. As she is about to leave, Patrick tries to stop her, but fails and leaves a message, asking her to call him as soon as possible. However, she learns that Patrick has had a stroke and they return to Walford. When he leaves hospital, he stays with Ian and Denise. Denise learns that Ian had sex with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) on the night Lucy died. Feeling betrayed, Denise locks herself in the Minute Mart. On returning home, she discovers that Cindy has returned and that Ian has delivered her newborn daughter, Beth. She tells Ian that she forgives him but leaves him the next day, taking Patrick back to live in his own house, declaring that Ian isn't the man she loved. Going into Patrick's house, Denise is devastated to find that the house has been broken into. Denise struggles to care for Patrick alone, despite support from [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). She finds that Denise has been stealing alcohol from the shop but does not report it if Denise returns the value. Patrick is devastated to learn that he may lose his allotment so Denise goes there, intending to maintain it, only to dig up Lucy's phone and purse. Although hesitant, she returns them to the Beales.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, a pregnant Kim surprises Denise and accuses Ian of ruining Denise's life. The next day, Kim finds bruises on Patrick's arms and realises Denise had beaten him and confronts her. At the pub, Denise gets drunk, and after hearing of [[Emma Summerhayes]]' ([[Anna Acton]]) death, drunkenly slurs that Lucy's killer would be jailed if Emma had done her job properly. In anger of Denise's disrespectfulness, Ian says that despite what Kim said, Denise has been ruining her own life. On arriving home, she tells Kim she cannot be Patrick's carer any more. After an argument with Denise in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Kim goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter named [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. Although she disowns Denise, they eventually reconcile the next day. After Pearl's christening, she tells Denise that her husband doesn't exist and she made him up because of fear of being alone. However, Kim's confessions to Shirley, [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) and Patrick reveal that her husband does exist but she left him when she found out that he was a criminal. Eventually, when her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) tracks her down in Walford, Kim works up the courage to tell Denise the truth about him and explains her experience when she went to tell him she was pregnant. Denise and Patrick soon become wary of Vincent's intentions.\n\nDenise is visited by the police, saying someone in their custody has given her address as theirs. Eventually she realises that it is Jordan (now played by [[Joivan Wade]]). She discovers that Jordan stole from Chelsea and Libby advises Denise to stay away from him. Denise visits Lucas in prison and he tells her that he thinks about her, asking her to find Jordan. Despite her family begging her not to, Denise sends Jordan a message online. He does not reply but visits and tells her to leave him alone. However, when Kim hits Jordan, he allows Denise to clean the wound. Jordan is received badly by the rest of the family but Denise defends him after he pushes her in frustration, he leaves when Patrick says he is just like Lucas. The police visit Denise and tell her that Jordan was attacked by a gang but discharged himself from hospital. She tracks him down and learns that Jordan's girlfriend died from a drug overdose. Denise brings Jordan and his son, [[JJ Johnson (EastEnders)|JJ Johnson]] (Zayden Kareem), home and although Patrick comes around to the idea, Kim believes it will bring Lucas back into Denise's life. Denise visits Lucas again and he wants Jordan to visit too. He does and Denise agrees to help Lucas get a job in the prison kitchens, but Lucas asks Jordan to help him in his plan for him to escape from prison. When Jordan tells Denise, she refuses to help and alerts Libby to call the police, after which Jordan reveals to them the truth about Lucas' plan before he is arrested. Denise vows to look after JJ until Jordan is released but Patrick secretly calls social services.<ref name=\"10mar16b\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/03/2016 (part 2)|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073c5pj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Writer: Jaden Clark |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 10 March 2016}}</ref> Denise is told by social worker [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hilary Taylor|Hilary Taylor]] (Sadie Shimmin) that JJ's mother, Amelle, is alive.<ref name=\"31mar16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 31/03/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075vwvg |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Michael Owen Morris; Writer: Carey Andrews |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 31 March 2016}}</ref> Amelle visits Denise and JJ, but he refuses to come out from under the table.

Denise tells Carmel that she has decided to have the baby and put it up for adoption. Kim finds out about Denise's plans and tries to talk her out of it whilst Patrick agrees to support her. Kim tells Denise that she and Vincent will adopt her baby, but Denise declines their offer. Shirley suspects that her former boyfriend, [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), is the father but Denise admits that Phil is the father. Unbeknownst to Denise and Shirley, Phil's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), overhears this. Denise is later taken to hospital to be induced. Kim and their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), also go to the hospital. Kim and Emerald are angry when they learn that Denise is putting her son up for adoption but Denise refuses to change her mind and says an emotional farewell to her son alone. Sharon tells Phil the truth about his son and he goes to the hospital, demanding to see him but then agrees to the adoption. Libby, Emerald and Carmel come to accept Denise's decision but Kim is against it, calling her selfish and saying Denise is dead to her. Denise is injured in a bus crash, but rejects Kim when she tries to support her.

Emerald then leaves and Kim and Denise hug. Denise confronts schoolboy [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]) after he vandalises the garden in the square. After continuously insulting Denise, she hits him in the face. Using witnesses to his advantage, Keegan reports Denise to the police and she is consequently fined \u00a3250.\n\nDenise later learns that her son's potential adoptive parents have named him Raymond and she signs the adoption forms. While she is adamant that she will not change her mind after that, she continues to struggle with her decision and angrily tears up a newly arrived letter from Raymond's adoptive parents without reading it. Kim then wrongly believes that Ian is Raymond's biological father and confronts him, causing Denise to break down and admit to her that Phil is the father, shocking Kim, and she begs Kim not to tell anyone. With Kim's help, Denise finds the letter from Raymond's parents in the recycling bin, informing her that he is happy with them, which comforts and reassures her. Denise and Kush start a relationship, but when Denise talks to a reporter, criticising the community and the Minute Mart, she quits her job after they decide to send her on a course. Denise struggles financially and is unable to buy food, taking food from bins. She ends her relationship with Kush because she does not want to admit her problems. Carmel later confronts her over this, but Denise slaps her when she makes a remark about Raymond, ending their friendship. Denise eventually claims for [[Universal Credit]], but is stunned that she will not receive money for ten weeks as she left her job voluntarily, but is given a referral to a food bank. Denise leaves the food bank when she sees Cora, who works there. Cora persuades Denise to get some food and explains that when she first used the food bank, she was abusive, but it saved her life. Denise gives her food to the children of a young mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Candice|Candice]] (Maia Watkins), who has no voucher. On the day of her final exam, Denise faints, but she is delighted later in the year when she passes her GCSE exam with high marks. Kush and Denise decide to try dating again, but when Kush asks Denise to move in with him, she declines, feeling that things are moving too fast for them. When Kush suffers a heart attack shortly afterwards, Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Denise discovers that Kim is pregnant, but Kim suffers a miscarriage and continues to lie that about her \"pregnancy\". Kim later cracks up and tells Denise and Carmel that she is not pregnant and is lying and they support her. For her birthday, Kim asks Denise to do a DNA test and she agrees. When the results come, Denise finds a card for her by Kim, which says they are not sisters, but Kim explains she has not seen the results and got cards for both outcomes. Denise and Kim agree not to find out, but Kim gives in and fools Denise that the results say they are not sisters, but is delighted when Kim says they are.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nOn 7 November 2005, the BBC announced that [[Diane Parish]] had been cast in ''EastEnders'' as a \"sassy, strong\" character with links to the established Wicks family, who would be \"a force to be reckoned with.\"<ref name=\"PR\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/07/eastenders.shtml |title=Kellie Shirley and Diane Parish to join EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Parish had previously appeared in the serial as singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.<ref name=\"PR\"/> In January 2006, Parish's character was revealed to be Denise Fox, who would embark on a romance with fellow newcomer [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]).

She made her first appearance on 11 May 2006 and temporarily left ''EastEnders'' in early 2008 to give birth to her second child. Her exit coincided with the departure of [[Matt Di Angelo]] ([[Dean Wicks]]) and permanent departures of cast members [[Phil Daniels]] ([[Kevin Wicks]]), [[Kellie Shirley]] ([[Carly Wicks]]). She returned to Walford on 6 June 2008. This is Parish's second role in ''EastEnders'', as she previously played singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.\n\nIntroduced as a single mother to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) who has come from an abusive marriage, Denise has gone on to marry two additional times. Firstly, to Kevin in 2007, who dies months later, and then to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) in 2009, with them divorcing two years later after he is imprisoned for murder. She also embarks on a loveless engagement to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), flings with younger men [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) and a drunken one-night stand with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) which results in a [[Advanced maternal age|late in life pregnancy]]. Denise's third child, a son, is born in 2017, but she gives him up for adoption, shortly before her mother tells her she is adopted herself (although this was later proved untrue). Other storylines involving Denise include surviving a bus crash, losing her job, descending into poverty and a relationship with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]).\n\n==Storylines==\nMoving to Walford, Denise has a tempestuous encounter with [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]); however, an attraction develops and they begin dating. Denise's former husband, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), an alcoholic, tries to reunite with their daughter, [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) and he later kidnaps her. He tries to drown himself and Libby but she recovers and Owen is arrested. Denise, who never knew her father but knows he played in a band called \"The Five Hectors\", thinks that [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) may be her father as he was in the band but a DNA test proves that he is not. The band also consisted of [[Aubrey Valentine]] ([[Joseph Marcell]]), [[Cedric Lucas]] ([[Ram John Holder]]), Dwight and Earl. The identity of Denise's father is never discovered, but Aubrey also eliminates himself.\n\nWhen Kevin's former wife, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), arrives in Walford, she causes problems for Denise and Kevin. Shirley reveals Kevin's secret, that he is not [[Dean Wicks|Deano]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and [[Carly Wicks|Carly]]'s ([[Kellie Shirley]]) biological father. After Shirley tells everyone this, Kevin flees. Upset, Denise threatens to move away but stays when Kevin returns and proposes marriage. Shirley unsuccessfully tries to ruin the wedding and Denise deals with various problems, including Chelsea and Dean's imprisonment for framing [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), Kevin's attempts to conceal the crime, and a feud with her boss at the post office, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). Kevin starts selling cars for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), but discovers they are [[Lemon (automobile)|cut-and-shut]]s; he tries to destroy the cars but dies in an accident. Denise and Carly leave Walford after the funeral, seeking the right place to scatter Kevin's ashes.\n\nDenise returns, but is angry to discover her daughter [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) is using drugs and in contact with her father, former drug addict [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Denise is initially hostile but she warms to him when she sees he has changed and they eventually reunite. Denise proposes to Lucas but he is married to [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]). Trina attempts to seduce Lucas but he accidentally kills her. Denise helps Jordan come to terms with his mother's death, with them believing it to be an overdose. With Trina dead, Denise and Lucas are able to marry, though further complications arise when Owen is released from prison. He desperately tries to show Denise that she cannot trust Lucas but they marry regardless. Lucas kills Owen on their wedding day and his body is discovered eight months later. Lucas confesses to Denise, claiming self-defence. At first, she agrees to protect him but convinces him to go to the police. However, he instead drives her to a canal. When she refuses to submit to God, he strangles her. He murders a prostitute, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Gemma|Gemma]] (Rita Balogun), and identifies her as Denise, her family believing she committed suicide. Lucas keeps Denise prisoner in the house next door but she escapes after a few weeks and Lucas is arrested, later sentenced to life imprisonment. Chelsea, needing a fresh start, moves to Spain with Owen's mother, [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]) and Libby joins them for a holiday before returning to university. Denise is heartbroken to see her girls leave but is distracted by her sister, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]), arriving and saying that she has left her boyfriend, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), and asks to move in with them.\n\nKim and Denise later buy the house next door and open a [[bed and breakfast]]. Denise talks to Zainab, who helps her move on by destroying memories of Lucas. Denise starts dating [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), Zainab's former husband, but ends it after realising he is still in love with Zainab. On Christmas Day 2011, Denise opens a present containing a broken toy car and a USB stick with a recording of Phil talking about his part in Kevin's death. Horrified, Denise calls Phil a murderer and tries to get him arrested but fails to do so.\n\nYusef starts a fire at the bed and breakfast, damaging it so badly that Denise, Kim and Patrick are forced to move out. The insurance company refuse to pay out as it was arson so Patrick gives Denise and Kim the Minute Mart but Zainab gives them Yusef's money so they can rebuild the bed and breakfast. When the B&B opens, Denise is angry that Kim simply flirts with the customers, leaving all the work to her. They have an argument and Denise quits but returns on the condition that Kim puts in more effort. When Zainab's brother-in-law. [[AJ Ahmed]] ([[Phaldut Sharma]]), arrives in Walford, he attempts to con Denise but fails. The two later have drinks but AJ leaves. Denise attends [[Christian Clarke]]'s ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) stag party where a man gives her unwanted attention. She has sex with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) when he defends her from an overly-persistent interest and allows him to walk her home. The next day, Denise is embarrassed and tells Fatboy it was a mistake. However, it is revealed she has feelings for Fatboy and after she welcomes him into her home, they have sex again. Denise agrees to pursue a secret relationship with Fatboy. When Fatboy tries to encourage her to make their relationship public, Denise calls it off, telling Fatboy she will treasure the memory of their time together. After a lonely Christmas, Kim and Zainab decide to set up a date for her. However, this fails and when Kim's boyfriend [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) comforts her, they share a kiss. Ray tells Kim about it but says Denise made the first move, so Kim slaps Denise and says she is dead to her. Denise and Kim reconcile until Ray ends his relationship with Kim. Kim blames Denise so Denise stays with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). When Ray tells Kim the truth, Denise and Kim reconcile and Denise moves back in with Kim.\n\nWhen Denise and Ian get locked in the Minute Mart's storage cupboard and share a kiss, it leads to a relationship. This becomes public, thanks to Ian's daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Denise helps Ian open a restaurant and supports him when [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) threatens and blackmails him. Denise moves in with Ian and his children and are joined by [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]), daughter of Ian's dead former wife. Denise begins to feel part of the family and supports Ian when he intends to testify that he saw [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. However, Ian fails to do this and Denise is devastated to learn that Ian was intending to lie to frame Max on Carl's orders. The return of Ian's former wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), causes Denise to have doubts about their relationship. She accepts Ian's marriage proposal and during their engagement party, she shares a kiss with Fatboy. They come to their senses when they are caught by [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]). Fatboy's girlfriend, [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), learns of the kiss and posts a letter to Ian, before leaving Walford but Lucy reads it and challenges Denise. For the sake of her father's mental health, Lucy agrees to keep it a secret. Denise and Ian drift apart due to his busy lifestyle. After visiting Libby in Oxford, she plans to leave Ian. However, when Lucy is murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), Denise feels forced to stay and support him. Denise is sidelined by Ian and decides to leave, confiding in Patrick that she feels trapped. However, worried that she will look like a bad person, Denise changes her mind and returns but still feels ostracised. She does not attend Lucy's funeral after seeing Ian and Jane comforting one another. Under advice from Libby, Denise tells Ian she can no longer be with him but he begs her to stay. Denise agrees to stay when Ian admits he has taken her for granted and encourages her to go with Libby to Spain to celebrate Chelsea's birthday.\n\nOn Denise's return, things are much better between her and Ian and he arranges for them to visit Libby in Oxford for a weekend. As she is about to leave, Patrick tries to stop her, but fails and leaves a message, asking her to call him as soon as possible. However, she learns that Patrick has had a stroke and they return to Walford. When he leaves hospital, he stays with Ian and Denise. Denise learns that Ian had sex with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) on the night Lucy died. Feeling betrayed, Denise locks herself in the Minute Mart. On returning home, she discovers that Cindy has returned and that Ian has delivered her newborn daughter, Beth. She tells Ian that she forgives him but leaves him the next day, taking Patrick back to live in his own house, declaring that Ian isn't the man she loved. Going into Patrick's house, Denise is devastated to find that the house has been broken into. Denise struggles to care for Patrick alone, despite support from [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). She finds that Denise has been stealing alcohol from the shop but does not report it if Denise returns the value. Patrick is devastated to learn that he may lose his allotment so Denise goes there, intending to maintain it, only to dig up Lucy's phone and purse. Although hesitant, she returns them to the Beales.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, a pregnant Kim surprises Denise and accuses Ian of ruining Denise's life. The next day, Kim finds bruises on Patrick's arms and realises Denise had beaten him and confronts her. At the pub, Denise gets drunk, and after hearing of [[Emma Summerhayes]]' ([[Anna Acton]]) death, drunkenly slurs that Lucy's killer would be jailed if Emma had done her job properly. In anger of Denise's disrespectfulness, Ian says that despite what Kim said, Denise has been ruining her own life. On arriving home, she tells Kim she cannot be Patrick's carer any more. After an argument with Denise in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Kim goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter named [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]]. Although she disowns Denise, they eventually reconcile the next day. After Pearl's christening, she tells Denise that her husband doesn't exist and she made him up because of fear of being alone. However, Kim's confessions to Shirley, [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) and Patrick reveal that her husband does exist but she left him when she found out that he was a criminal. Eventually, when her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) tracks her down in Walford, Kim works up the courage to tell Denise the truth about him and explains her experience when she went to tell him she was pregnant. Denise and Patrick soon become wary of Vincent's intentions.\n\nDenise is visited by the police, saying someone in their custody has given her address as theirs. Eventually she realises that it is Jordan (now played by [[Joivan Wade]]). She discovers that Jordan stole from Chelsea and Libby advises Denise to stay away from him. Denise visits Lucas in prison and he tells her that he thinks about her, asking her to find Jordan. Despite her family begging her not to, Denise sends Jordan a message online. He does not reply but visits and tells her to leave him alone. However, when Kim hits Jordan, he allows Denise to clean the wound. Jordan is received badly by the rest of the family but Denise defends him after he pushes her in frustration, he leaves when Patrick says he is just like Lucas. The police visit Denise and tell her that Jordan was attacked by a gang but discharged himself from hospital. She tracks him down and learns that Jordan's girlfriend died from a drug overdose. Denise brings Jordan and his son, [[JJ Johnson (EastEnders)|JJ Johnson]] (Zayden Kareem), home and although Patrick comes around to the idea, Kim believes it will bring Lucas back into Denise's life. Denise visits Lucas again and he wants Jordan to visit too. He does and Denise agrees to help Lucas get a job in the prison kitchens, but Lucas asks Jordan to help him in his plan for him to escape from prison. When Jordan tells Denise, she refuses to help and alerts Libby to call the police, after which Jordan reveals to them the truth about Lucas' plan before he is arrested. Denise vows to look after JJ until Jordan is released but Patrick secretly calls social services.<ref name=\"10mar16b\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/03/2016 (part 2)|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073c5pj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Writer: Jaden Clark |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 10 March 2016}}</ref> Denise is told by social worker [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hilary Taylor|Hilary Taylor]] (Sadie Shimmin) that JJ's mother, Amelle, is alive.<ref name=\"31mar16\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 31/03/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075vwvg |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Michael Owen Morris; Writer: Carey Andrews |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 31 March 2016}}</ref> Amelle visits Denise and JJ, but he refuses to come out from under the table.

Denise tells Carmel that she has decided to have the baby and put it up for adoption. Kim finds out about Denise's plans and tries to talk her out of it whilst Patrick agrees to support her. Kim tells Denise that she and Vincent will adopt her baby, but Denise declines their offer. Shirley suspects that her former boyfriend, [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]), is the father but Denise admits that Phil is the father. Unbeknownst to Denise and Shirley, Phil's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), overhears this. Denise is later taken to hospital to be induced. Kim and their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Do\u00f1a Croll]]), also go to the hospital. Kim and Emerald are angry when they learn that Denise is putting her son up for adoption but Denise refuses to change her mind and says an emotional farewell to her son alone. Sharon tells Phil the truth about his son and he goes to the hospital, demanding to see him but then agrees to the adoption. Libby, Emerald and Carmel come to accept Denise's decision but Kim is against it, calling her selfish and saying Denise is dead to her.

After a check up at the hospital, Denise admits to [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) that Kim was right and that she should never have given up her son for adoption, though he reassures her that it is the best decision she has made for him.<ref name=\"26jan17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 26/01/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08cbhfj |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Toby Frow, Richard Lynn; Writer: Matt Evans |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 26 January 2017 }}</ref> Denise soon realises that Kim still sees her as a mother figure since Emerald abandoned them as children and thinks that if Denise can give up her son, then she can abandon Kim, so Denise tells to consider herself abandoned.<ref name=\"2feb17\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 02/02/2017 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08d6np0 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: Rick Platt; Writer: Jesse O'Mahoney |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 2 February 2017 }}</ref> Denise later goes to Emerald's farewell party where Emerald criticises Kim's parenting; Denise stands up for Kim and Kim admits that she is thankful for her sister, to which Emerald replies that they are not sisters and that Denise was brought to her as a baby. Emerald then leaves and Kim and Denise hug. Denise confronts schoolboy [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris (actor)|Zack Morris]]) after he vandalises the garden in the square. After continuously insulting Denise, she hits him in the face. Using witnesses to his advantage, Keegan reports Denise to the police and she is consequently fined \u00a3250.\n\nDenise later learns that her son's potential adoptive parents have named him Raymond and she signs the adoption forms. While she is adamant that she will not change her mind after that, she continues to struggle with her decision and angrily tears up a newly arrived letter from Raymond's adoptive parents without reading it. Kim then wrongly believes that Ian is Raymond's biological father and confronts him, causing Denise to break down and admit to her that Phil is the father, shocking Kim, and she begs Kim not to tell anyone. With Kim's help, Denise finds the letter from Raymond's parents in the recycling bin, informing her that he is happy with them, which comforts and reassures her. Denise and Kush start a relationship, but when Denise talks to a reporter, criticising the community and the Minute Mart, she quits her job after they decide to send her on a course. Denise struggles financially and is unable to buy food, taking food from bins. She ends her relationship with Kush because she does not want to admit her problems. Carmel later confronts her over this, but Denise slaps her when she makes a remark about Raymond, ending their friendship. Denise eventually claims for [[Universal Credit]], but is stunned that she will not receive money for ten weeks as she left her job voluntarily, but is given a referral to a food bank. Denise leaves the food bank when she sees Cora, who works there. Cora persuades Denise to get some food and explains that when she first used the food bank, she was abusive, but it saved her life. Denise gives her food to the children of a young mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Candice|Candice]] (Maia Watkins), who has no voucher. On the day of her final exam, Denise faints, but she is delighted later in the year when she passes her GCSE exam with high marks. Kush and Denise decide to try dating again, but when Kush asks Denise to move in with him, she declines, feeling that things are moving too fast for them. When Kush suffers a heart attack shortly afterwards, Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Denise discovers that Kim is pregnant, but Kim suffers a miscarriage and continues to lie that about her \"pregnancy\". Kim later cracks up and tells Denise and Carmel that she is not pregnant and is lying and they support her. For her birthday, Kim asks Denise to do a DNA test and she agrees. When the results come, Denise finds a card for her by Kim, which says they are not sisters, but Kim explains she has not seen the results and got cards for both outcomes. Denise and Kim agree not to find out, but Kim gives in and fools Denise that the results say they are not sisters, but is delighted when Kim says they are.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting and introduction===\nOn 7 November 2005, the BBC announced that [[Diane Parish]] had been cast in ''EastEnders'' as a \"sassy, strong\" character with links to the established Wicks family, who would be \"a force to be reckoned with.\"<ref name=\"PR\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/07/eastenders.shtml |title=Kellie Shirley and Diane Parish to join EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Parish had previously appeared in the serial as singer [[Lola Christie]] in 1998.<ref name=\"PR\"/> In January 2006, Parish's character was revealed to be Denise Fox, who would embark on a romance with fellow newcomer [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]).

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying \"We don't know precisely when and we don't know precisely where.\"<ref name = Shifting /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/trump-suleimani-explanations.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114031550/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/trump-suleimani-explanations.html |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/pompeo-barr-soleimani-strike-iran-rationale/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114031550/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/pompeo-barr-soleimani-strike-iran-rationale/index.html |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The legality of the attack was subsequently brought into question in respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying \"We don't know precisely when and we don't know precisely where.\"<ref name = Shifting /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/trump-suleimani-explanations.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114031550/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/trump-suleimani-explanations.html |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/pompeo-barr-soleimani-strike-iran-rationale/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114031550/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/pompeo-barr-soleimani-strike-iran-rationale/index.html |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The legality of the attack was subsequently brought into question in respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

Later in the article, in the 'Legality' section, the strike is clearly described to be illegal. Thus, the airstrike should be considered the assassination of a foreign government official. It is hard to argue that if the circumstances were reversed, and a U.S. general was killed by airstrike on U.S. soil, such an act wouldn't be considered an assassination.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US. It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> At midnight, she released the album's lead single, \"[[Me!]]\" featuring [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], along with its accompanying music video.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> Swift encouraged fans to find hints about the album title in the video and many fans pointed out that at one point in the video, the word \"Lover\" appeared on a neon light up sign at the top of a building in the background.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Savannah |title=Taylor Swift's New Album Title Hint Suggests That Apparently Fans May Already Know It |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |website=Bustle |accessdate=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621150341/https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2019, she confirmed the album title in a live stream on Instagram, and that the album would be released on August 23, 2019.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|first=Raisa|last=Bruner|title=Taylor Swift Just Announced the Summer Release Date for Her New Album Lover and Next Song|date=June 13, 2019|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235726/https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift also announced that the album's second single, \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\", would be released the next day on June 14, followed by its music video three days later.<ref name=\"billboardpop\">{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Katie |title=Taylor Swift Announces New Song 'You Need to Calm Down' & 'Lover' Album Release Date |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |website=Billboard |date=June 13, 2019 |accessdate=June 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614004337/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |archive-date=June 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> She described the album as a romantic one, stating that it was \"not just simply thematically, like it's all love songs or something.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK.

It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively.

Horse-drawn buses were introduced in 1841.\nServices were run by the ''Societ\u00e0 Anonima degli Omnibus'' (SAO), \"Omnibus Anonymous Company\". The company was responsible for 11 bus lines between 1861 and 1865.\n\nFew years later the first horse-drawn trams were introduced: 3 lines were opened in 1881 followed in 1893 by the first electric tramway, built by [[Edison (company)|Edison]] company. Two years later the same company opened 18 more lines, all ruled by municipality offices. Edison's concession on new lines expired in 1917, leaving all the operations to the municipality. Few years later the public offices responsible for public transport operations were made independent, becoming the ''Azienda Tranviaria Municipale'' (ATM) in 1931.\n\nIn the meantime, the first petrol powered bus lines were introduced in 1905, operated by SITA (''Societ\u00e0 Italiana Trasporto con Automobili'') and then moved under control of ATM along with the first [[trolleybus]] line (1933).\n\nAfter [[World War II]] resources were focused on bus lines and, since the mid-1950s, on the new [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]]. [[Milan Metro]] construction began in 1957 and in 1964 the [[Milan Metro Line 1|first line]] was opened. Five years later the [[Milan Metro Line 2|Line 2]] was inaugurated.\n\nOn 1 January 1965, ATM changed its name to \"Azienda Trasporti Municipali\" (''Municipal Transport Company''). In these years a new generation of longer tram (jumbotram) were introduced. In the 1960s Italy and Milan saw a strong increase in car owners, and the increasing importance of private over public transport.\n\nSeveral new stations of the two metro lines are opened in the following years. The new [[Milan Metro Line 3|Line 3]] was inaugurated in 1990.\n<!-- Nel 1990 la terza linea metropolitana (la linea gialla) viene aperta e le altre due vengono prolungate, mentre ATM si dota di vetture meno inquinanti e potenzia il trasporto ad alimentazione elettrica. -->\nTram line 15 to [[Rozzano]] was the first to go beyond the city border in 1992.\n\nATM changed its name again in 1999 to adopt the current one, \"Azienda Trasporti Milanesi\", and it became a [[Societ\u00e0 per Azioni|S.p.a.]] in 2001.  In these years, the first on-demand service, the Radiobus, was introduced to operate during the night.\n\nThe first [[fast tram]] line (Line 7) was introduced on 7 December 2002. This was followed by other 2 on 8 December 2003: Line 4 on the north and Line 15 on the south.\n\nNew magnetic tickets and electronic pass cards were introduced in 2004.

Horse-drawn buses were introduced in 1841.\nServices were run by the ''Societ\u00e0 Anonima degli Omnibus'' (SAO), \"Omnibus Anonymous Company\". The company was responsible for 11 bus lines between 1861 and 1865.\n\nFew years later the first horse-drawn trams were introduced: 3 lines were opened in 1881 followed in 1893 by the first electric tramway, built by [[Edison (company)|Edison]] company. Two years later the same company opened 18 more lines, all ruled by municipality offices. Edison's concession on new lines expired in 1917, leaving all the operations to the municipality. Few years later the public offices responsible for public transport operations were made independent, becoming the ''Azienda Tranviaria Municipale'' (ATM) in 1931.\n\nIn the meantime, the first petrol powered bus lines were introduced in 1905, operated by SITA (''Societ\u00e0 Italiana Trasporto con Automobili'') and then moved under control of ATM along with the first [[trolleybus]] line (1933).\n\nAfter [[World War II]] resources were focused on bus lines and, since the mid-1950s, on the new [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]]. [[Milan Metro]] construction began in 1957 and in 1964 the [[Milan Metro Line 1|first line]] was opened. Five years later the [[Milan Metro Line 2|Line 2]] was inaugurated.\n\nOn 1 January 1965, ATM changed its name to \"Azienda Trasporti Municipali\" (''Municipal Transport Company''). In these years a new generation of longer tram (jumbotram) were introduced. In the 1960s Italy and Milan saw a strong increase in car owners, and the increasing importance of private over public transport.\n\nSeveral new stations of the two metro lines are opened in the following years. The new [[Milan Metro Line 3|Line 3]] was inaugurated in 1990.\n<!-- Nel 1990 la terza linea metropolitana (la linea gialla) viene aperta e le altre due vengono prolungate, mentre ATM si dota di vetture meno inquinanti e potenzia il trasporto ad alimentazione elettrica. -->\nTram line 15 to [[Rozzano]] was the first to go beyond the city border in 1992.\n\nATM changed its name again in 1999 to adopt the current one, \"Azienda Trasporti Milanesi\", and it became a [[Societ\u00e0 per Azioni|S.p.a.]] in 2001.  In these years, the first on-demand service, the Radiobus, was introduced to operate during the night.\n\nThe first [[fast tram]] line (Line 7) was introduced on 7 December 2002. This was followed by other 2 on 8 December 2003: Line 4 on the north and Line 15 on the south.\n\nNew magnetic tickets and electronic pass cards were introduced in 2004. The complete upgrade process took 3 years.\n\n[[File:ATM 7021.jpg|thumb|A ''7000'' series low-floor articulated streetcar (''[[Eurotram]]''), on line 15.]]\n[[File:ATM 961.jpg|thumb|An [[IVECO]] trolleybus on line 92 at the [[Bovisa]], near the [[Milano Bovisa-Politecnico railway station|railway station]].]]\n[[File:ATMbus 2941.JPG|thumb|A [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] on line 70, in via Carlo Farini.]]\n[[File:Milano - Metropolitana Duomo - Linea gialla - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 3-jan-2007 - 03.jpg|thumb|A train of underground line M3 bound for piazzale Maciachini (now extended to Comasina) entering the Duomo station.]]\n\n==Network==\n\n===Rapid transit===\n{{main|Milan Metro}}\nThe Milan [[rapid transit]] network consists of 4 lines:\n* '''[[Milan Metro Line 1|M1]]''' Sesto I Maggio - [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]] Fiera / Bisceglie\n* '''[[Milan Metro Line 2|M2]]''' Assago Milanofiori Forum / Abbiategrasso - [[Cologno Monzese|Cologno]] Nord / [[Gessate]]\n* '''[[Milan Metro Line 3|M3]]''' San Donato - Comasina\n* '''[[Milan Metro Line 5|M5]]''' San Siro Stadio - Bignami\nThe network is more than {{convert|100|km|abbr=on|0}} long and serves 113 stations, mainly underground.
