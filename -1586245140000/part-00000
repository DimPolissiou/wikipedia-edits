With the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin (Malkovich), Chenery navigates the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner [[Citation (horse)|in 25 years]] and one of the greatest racehorses of all time.\n\n===Long version===\nPenny learns of her mother's death and returns to her childhood home.  She reunites with Mrs. Ham, her father's secretary, and comforts her confused and elderly father. At her mother's funeral, Penny meets [[Arthur B. Hancock, Jr.|Arthur \"Bull\" Hancock]] and his son, Seth Hancock, of [[Claiborne Farm]] in Kentucky. The Hancocks offer any help she may need during her efforts to bring Meadow Stables back to profitability. Penny's brother Hollis informs her of a dishonest sale that was about to be made by the trainer until their mother stopped him. Penny fires the trainer and asks Bull Hancock to help her find a new trainer. He recommends Lucien Laurin, an aging [[French Canadian]], who initially turns down Penny's offer.\n\nPenny's father had made a deal with leading owner [[Ogden Phipps]] that if Phipps breeds his best stallion ([[Bold Ruler]]) to Chenery's two best mares ([[Somethingroyal]] and Hasty Matelda), the two owners would flip a coin to see who receives which foal. Bold Ruler, the stallion, was fast but couldn't last over distances. Hasty Matelda is the obvious choice for her young age, but Somethingroyal's bloodline is made up of many horses with good stamina. Penny hopes to choose Somethingroyal's foal for the interesting mix of speed and stamina. Phipps wins the toss and chooses Hasty Matelda's foal, leaving Penny with Somethingroyal's foal, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].\n\nWhen Secretariat enters his first race at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] race track in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], everyone has high expectations. The jockey, Paul Feliciano, is very young with little experience, which worries Penny, but Lucien reassures her. During the race, Secretariat is repeatedly hit by other horses and comes in fourth. Penny and Lucien fight, and Lucien blames Paul for the loss. Penny realizes the only way Secretariat will ever win is if he has an experienced jockey. Penny's flight back home is canceled on the day of the race, and she misses her daughter Kate's solo in a play. Her son holds up the pay phone so Penny can hear Kate sing.\n\nPenny gets experienced jockey [[Ron Turcotte]] to ride Secretariat to many victories. Secretariat is named horse of the year after a successful two-year-old season. Penny's father suffers a stroke and dies, leaving Penny and her brother Hollis to inherit the estate. Although she needs six million dollars to pay [[estate tax]]es, Penny refuses to sell Secretariat.\n\nInstead she [[syndicate]]s the horse, selling 32 shares worth more than six million dollars, as long as he can win a three-year-old distance race. She tries to sell a share to Ogden Phipps, who instead offers to buy the horse for seven million dollars. Penny refuses to sell him. When Phipps demands to know why, she tells him Secretariat's value will triple when he wins the Triple Crown \u2013 a feat no horse has accomplished in twenty-five years. During this time, [[Frank \"Pancho\" Martin]], trainer of rival horse [[Sham (horse)|Sham]], tries to provoke a match race with Secretariat.\n\nSecretariat is taken to the [[Wood Memorial]] three weeks before the first of the Triple Crown races to take on [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] and attempt to earn Penny her syndication money. Turcotte notices that the horse's breathing is heavy, he refuses to eat, and he is reluctant to allow the bit into his mouth. After Secretariat loses the race, an [[abscess]] in his mouth is discovered that may have caused the poor performance.\n\nSecretariat recovers and wins both the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes|Preakness]] in record time.  Sham comes in second place in both races and Pancho Martin tells Sham's jockey, Laffit Pincay, to stay with Secretariat through the [[Belmont Stakes|Belmont]] in an attempt to tire him early and win.  However, Secretariat runs [[1973 Belmont Stakes|an unbelievable race]], finishing 31 [[Horse length|lengths]] (over {{convert|82|yd|m}}) ahead of the next horse to secure the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].  An exhausted Sham ends up in last place, having failed to keep up with Secretariat's record-breaking pace.  Penny and her family receive the Triple Crown trophy at the end of the race.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Diane Lane]] as [[Penny Chenery]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Lucien Laurin]]\n* Otto Thorwarth as [[Ron Turcotte]]\n* Esteemed character actress [[Margo Martindale]] as Elizabeth Hamm\n* [[AJ Michalka|Amanda Michalka]] as Kate Tweedy\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Earl Jansen\n* [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]] as [[William Nack|Bill Nack]]\n* [[Carissa Capobianco]] as Sarah Tweedy\n* [[Drew Roy]] as Seth Hancock\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Christopher Chenery]]\n* [[James Cromwell]] as [[Ogden Phipps]]\n* [[Nelsan Ellis]] as [[Eddie Sweat]]\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as John Tweedy\n* [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]] as [[Arthur B.

These include:\n*The film makes no mention of [[Riva Ridge]], a Chenery-owned horse that had won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and Belmont, and helped keep Meadow Stable afloat. According to Christine, but for Riva Ridge's career, Chenery might not have even owned Secretariat by the time he turned three. \n*The portrayal of several people, including Pancho Martin and Ogden Phipps, is \"cartoonish\". \n*The film leads viewers to believe that [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] won the [[Wood Memorial Stakes|Wood Memorial]], a major prep race then held two weeks before the Derby. In reality, that race was won by [[Angle Light]]. Chenery's most significant conflict in the run-up to the Derby was not with Phipps, but instead with Edwin Whittaker, the owner of Angle Light (a horse also trained by Laurin).<ref name=\"Christine tales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.horseraceinsider.com/west-coast-wash/comments/10052010-the-tales-the-secretariat-movie-forgot/#comments |title=The Tales the Secretariat Movie Forgot |first=Bill |last=Christine |publisher=Horserace Insider |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSteve Haskin, a sportswriter for ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'', had some of the same issues, particularly the omission of Riva Ridge and the staging of the Wood Memorial. He also added: \"Although the horses who played Secretariat did not capture the majesty and physical presence of Big Red, the equine stars did well enough, considering there isn't a horse alive who could have done justice to him.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Haskin|first1=Steve|title=Big Red on the Big Screen|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/horse-racing-steve-haskin/archive/2010/09/19/big-red-on-the-big-screen.aspx|website=cs.bloodhorse.com|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nA more thorough comparison between the film and history can be drawn from comparing the plot summary to the narrative of events in the actual life of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in third place at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $4 million on opening day and $12,694,770 over the three-day weekend, just falling behind ''[[The Social Network]]'' and ''[[Life as We Know It (film)|Life as We Know It]]''.

These include:\n*The film makes no mention of [[Riva Ridge]], a Chenery-owned horse that had won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and Belmont, and helped keep Meadow Stable afloat. According to Christine, but for Riva Ridge's career, Chenery might not have even owned Secretariat by the time he turned three. \n*The portrayal of several people, including Pancho Martin and Ogden Phipps, is \"cartoonish\". \n*The film leads viewers to believe that [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] won the [[Wood Memorial Stakes|Wood Memorial]], a major prep race then held two weeks before the Derby. In reality, that race was won by [[Angle Light]]. Chenery's most significant conflict in the run-up to the Derby was not with Phipps, but instead with Edwin Whittaker, the owner of Angle Light (a horse also trained by Laurin).<ref name=\"Christine tales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.horseraceinsider.com/west-coast-wash/comments/10052010-the-tales-the-secretariat-movie-forgot/#comments |title=The Tales the Secretariat Movie Forgot |first=Bill |last=Christine |publisher=Horserace Insider |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSteve Haskin, a sportswriter for ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'', had some of the same issues, particularly the omission of Riva Ridge and the staging of the Wood Memorial. He also added: \"Although the horses who played Secretariat did not capture the majesty and physical presence of Big Red, the equine stars did well enough, considering there isn't a horse alive who could have done justice to him.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Haskin|first1=Steve|title=Big Red on the Big Screen|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/horse-racing-steve-haskin/archive/2010/09/19/big-red-on-the-big-screen.aspx|website=cs.bloodhorse.com|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nA more thorough comparison between the film and history can be drawn from comparing the plot summary to the narrative of events in the actual life of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in third place at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $4 million on opening day and $12,694,770 over the three-day weekend, just falling behind ''[[The Social Network]]'' and ''[[Life as We Know It (film)|Life as We Know It]]''.

The Loyola Heights segment of [[Circumferential Road 5]], in [[Quezon City]]. It traverses the Marikina Valley and passes through [[Antipolo]], where it intersects the [[Sumulong Highway]] (at Masinag). After Masinag the road starts its ascent towards the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] passing through [[Tanay, Rizal]], [[Santa Maria, Laguna]], finally to [[Infanta, Quezon]].\n\n==Route description==\n===Greater Manila Area Segment (Until Rizal Province, Sta. Maria, Laguna to Infanta, Quezon)=== \n\nThe Marcos highway starts as a physical continuation of Aurora Boulevard under Katipunan Flyover. The highway slightly curves at the intersection with Andres Bonifacio Avenue connecting the Marikina city proper, then crosses the [[Marikina River]]. The Diosdado B. Macapagal Bridge that connects with [[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]] merges in front of [[SM City Marikina]]. The [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Manila Line 2]] and the Cainta - Marikina subtransmission line of [[Meralco]] parallel the highway. The highway makes another slight curve at  the approach to Cainta. It soon runs over the Cainta-Marikina boundary, and then goes straight towards the Cainta-Antipolo boundary towards the Masinag Junction with [[Sumulong Highway]] wherein it continues on to Cogeo towards the rest of the [[Rizal Province]], [[Sta. Maria, Laguna]] to [[Infanta, Quezon]]\n\nThis highway, also commonly called '''Marcos Highway''' is a divided road featuring U-turn slots, and bike lanes. Several establishments, like the [[Riverbanks Center]], [[SM City Marikina]], [[Ayala Malls Feliz]], [[Robinsons Metro East]], [[Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall]], and [[SM City Masinag]] are primary landmarks accessible through the road. Meralco subtransmission lines line the Cainta-Masinag segment of the highway up to [[Santa Maria, Laguna]] until the [[Infanta, Quezon]] Junction\n\n===Rizal-Laguna-Quezon Segment===\nThis stretch of the highway is a standard 2-6 lane road divided by lane markings typical of national highways located in the provinces. Road size varies depending on the density of the location as well as the engineering district wherein numerous road widening may occur as determined by the DPWH. The road ends and merges with Famy\u2013Real\u2013Infanta Road (Route 601).\n\n===Route numbers===\nSince 2014 with the implementation of the new route numbering system by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH), it is the component of '''National Route 59''' ('''N59''') of the highway in the [[Philippine highway network]] in the Greater Manila Area. From Rizal to Quezon, the road remains unnumbered and identified as a tertiary national road.\n\n==History==\n{{emdash}}  The High\n\nhway existed far back to the American colonial era as '''Highway 55''' which included present-day [[Recto Avenue]], [[Legarda Street]], [[Magsaysay Boulevard]] and [[Aurora Boulevard]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Intersections==\n{{PHLinttop|km_ref=<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Manila|url=http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|work=2016 DPWH data|publisher=[[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]|accessdate=August 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813151232/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n{{PHLint\n|hucicc=Marikina\n|lspan=3\n|km=\n|km2=\n|road={{Jct|country=PHL|N|11|name1=[[Circumferential Road 5|C.P.

The Loyola Heights segment of [[Circumferential Road 5]], in [[Quezon City]]. It traverses the Marikina Valley and passes through [[Antipolo]], where it intersects the [[Sumulong Highway]] (at Masinag). After Masinag the road starts its ascent towards the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] passing through [[Tanay, Rizal]], [[Santa Maria, Laguna]], finally to [[Infanta, Quezon]].\n\n==Route description==\n===Greater Manila Area Segment (Until Rizal Province, Sta. Maria, Laguna to Infanta, Quezon)=== \n\nThe Marcos highway starts as a physical continuation of Aurora Boulevard under Katipunan Flyover. The highway slightly curves at the intersection with Andres Bonifacio Avenue connecting the Marikina city proper, then crosses the [[Marikina River]]. The Diosdado B. Macapagal Bridge that connects with [[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]] merges in front of [[SM City Marikina]]. The [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Manila Line 2]] and the Cainta - Marikina subtransmission line of [[Meralco]] parallel the highway. The highway makes another slight curve at  the approach to Cainta. It soon runs over the Cainta-Marikina boundary, and then goes straight towards the Cainta-Antipolo boundary towards the Masinag Junction with [[Sumulong Highway]] wherein it continues on to Cogeo towards the rest of the [[Rizal Province]], [[Sta. Maria, Laguna]] to [[Infanta, Quezon]]\n\nThis highway, also commonly called '''Marcos Highway''' is a divided road featuring U-turn slots, and bike lanes. Several establishments, like the [[Riverbanks Center]], [[SM City Marikina]], [[Ayala Malls Feliz]], [[Robinsons Metro East]], [[Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall]], and [[SM City Masinag]] are primary landmarks accessible through the road. Meralco subtransmission lines line the Cainta-Masinag segment of the highway up to [[Santa Maria, Laguna]] until the [[Infanta, Quezon]] Junction\n\n===Rizal-Laguna-Quezon Segment===\nThis stretch of the highway is a standard 2-6 lane road divided by lane markings typical of national highways located in the provinces. Road size varies depending on the density of the location as well as the engineering district wherein numerous road widening may occur as determined by the DPWH. The road ends and merges with Famy\u2013Real\u2013Infanta Road (Route 601).\n\n===Route numbers===\nSince 2014 with the implementation of the new route numbering system by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH), it is the component of '''National Route 59''' ('''N59''') of the highway in the [[Philippine highway network]] in the Greater Manila Area. From Rizal to Quezon, the road remains unnumbered and identified as a tertiary national road.\n\n==History==\n{{emdash}} The High\n\nhway existed far back to the American colonial era as '''Highway 55''' which included present-day [[Recto Avenue]], [[Legarda Street]], [[Magsaysay Boulevard]] and [[Aurora Boulevard]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Intersections==\n{{PHLinttop|km_ref=<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Manila|url=http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|work=2016 DPWH data|publisher=[[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]|accessdate=August 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813151232/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/2016%20DPWH%20Road%20and%20Bridge%20Inventory%20v.2/Road%20Data%202016/north_manila.htm|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n{{PHLint\n|hucicc=Marikina\n|lspan=3\n|km=\n|km2=\n|road={{Jct|country=PHL|N|11|name1=[[Circumferential Road 5|C.P.

After Andrew and his family left for America, George stayed in Scotland where he would go on to graduate from Glasgow University with a degree in mechanical engineering while studying under [[Lord Kelvin]].<ref name=Carnegie1920 />\n\n== Business life ==\n[[File:George Lauder, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Miller.png|left|thumb|Andrew Carnegie, George Lauder, and Thomas Miller]]\nIn 1873, Carnegie wrote to Lauder, who, despite still living in Scotland, had never ceased to be his closest confidant and advisor, to inquire about a term used in a new contract for the steel for use in the new [[Eads Bridge]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The term unknown to Carnegie was 'the modulus of elasticity' of [[Elastic modulus]]. Lauder, an academic, answered swiftly and capably which provoked Carnegie to ask Lauder to join him in America as a partner in the Carnegie Steel Corporation.<ref name=\"Casson 1907 147\">{{cite book|last=Casson|first=Herbert Newton|title=The romance of steel: the story of a thousand millionaires |date=1907 |publisher=Harvard University|location=Cambridge, MA|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXPw70C8l8cC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=%22george+lauder%22+%22the+modulus+of+elasticity%22&source=bl&ots=LoB0kuJYjG&sig=ACfU3U0naux_SsnoV9H0lYJOlqAZzy3-FA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibq9rHyKHlAhVFqp4KHTvEC9MQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22george%20lauder%22%20%22the%20modulus%20of%20elasticity%22&f=false}}</ref> Lauder accepted, and joined Carnegie and the other partners in Pittsburgh.\n\nLauder brought a new dynamic to the business with his formal education, and expertise in, [[mechanical engineering]]. Surprisingly, this was both rare and unique among the partners of the business, which included Carnegie, Carnegie's brother (and also Lauder's cousin) [[Thomas M. Carnegie]], [[Henry Phipps, Jr.]], and [[Henry Clay Frick]]\u2014most of whom had learned business as they went and none of whom had technical training of any kind.\n\nAfter joining the syndicate, Lauder brought several new developments to the steel industry in America. Included was the process for washing and coking dross from coal mines, which resulted in a significant increase to the overall value of the business and became industry-standard world-wide in the production of steel.<ref name=Carnegie1920 />\n\nLauder would also go on to lead the development of the use of steel in armor and armaments, which had been a business Carnegie balked at entering until President [[Benjamin Harrison]] personally appealed to him by provoking patriotism. Lauder and [[Charles M.

Black Jack has also been animated into an [[OVA]], two television series (directed by Tezuka's son [[Makoto Tezuka]]) and two films. ''Black Jack'' is Tezuka's third most famous manga, after ''[[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]]'' and ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''. In 1977, it won the 1st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] for [[sh\u014dnen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |author=Joel Hahn |title=Kodansha Manga Awards |work=Comic Book Awards Almanac |accessdate=21 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816031310/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |archivedate=16 August 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[About.com]]'s Deb Aoki lists ''Black Jack'' as the best \"re-issue of previously released material\" of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/2008BestNewManga.htm|title=2008 Best New Manga|last=Aoki|first=Deb|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DtJu9fgL?url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/2008BestNewManga.htm|archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref> Osamu Dezaki's anime film adaptation, ''Black Jack The Movie'', won [[Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film|Best Animation Film]] at the 1996 [[Mainichi Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nMost of the stories involve Black Jack doing some good deed, for which he rarely gets recognition\u2014often curing the poor and destitute for free, or teaching the arrogant a lesson in humility. They sometimes end with a good, humane person enduring hardship, often unavoidable death, to save others.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n; Black Jack ''aka'' Kur\u014d Hazama\n{{main|Black Jack (manga character)}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 1: \"Is there a Doctor?\"\n\n; {{nihongo|Pinoko|\u30d4\u30ce\u30b3}}\n* Voiced by: [[Y\u016bko Mizutani]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratogenous Cystoma\"\n* '''Pinoko''' is Black Jack's loyal assistant/adopted daughter, who was actually a Teratogenous Cystoma (a growth more commonly known as a [[Teratoma#Fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma|teratoma]]). As seen in Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratogenous Cystoma\", she was a rare type of [[parasitic twin]], living as part of a patients' body for eighteen years.  When the presence of the twin was evidenced from a grotesque distortion in the host's body, Black Jack was contracted to extract and dispose of the growth.  In the end, he found the cystoma, although a collection of uncontained organs and muscles, was complete in design if not form.  Using life support to maintain them, Black Jack encased the assembly in an artificially constructed exoskeleton sized and shaped in the form of a female human child (around 7 or 8 years); miraculously, the homunculus survived with all sensory reception intact.  Her body is fully capable of walking, running, breathing and consuming and digesting food.  Only her [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and [[internal organ]]s are real; her face and body though artificial are remarkably human in design. Developing into a sentient though permanently child-sized life form, she was adopted by Black Jack as his informal ward.\n* She always helps the doctor by doing household chores and by even being his assistant in some of his operations. She often acts as [[comic relief]] in ''Black Jack'', claiming to be a girl of eighteen years of age and married to Black Jack, despite her childlike appearance and personality.  Her main value is companionship and source of affection for the ordinarily cold-natured doctor.\n* When she started living with Black Jack, she couldn't cook, clean, or take care of the house; she couldn't even walk, let alone move. Eventually, she learned them and could take care of the house when he is out. But sometimes she is able to mix ingredients around in her cooking, like using salt instead of sugar.\n* Black Jack thinks of her as his daughter while she thinks of herself as his wife.\n* Black Jack modeled her face after a cute girl he had seen in a medical journal who suffers from a lung ailment of unknown origin (from Volume 7 Chapter 4: \"The Two Pinokos\").\n* Pinoko's life was put in danger a few times; she was kidnapped (Volume 2 Chapter 8: \"Kidnapping\", Volume 14 Chapter 2: \"The Third Call\", Volume 15 Chapter 1: \"Treasure Island\"), swallowed a [[potassium cyanide]] pill (Volume 4 Chapter 12: \"Gas\"), shot from a bullet (Volume 7 Chapter 10: \"Black and White\"), crashed a car (Volume 8 Chapter 8: \"A Visit from a Killer\"), and caught an aggressive form of [[leukemia]] (Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\").\n* Pinoko says she is 18 years old because that is how long she was in her sister's body, but Black Jack says she is 0-years-old when he built her. Because of that, she sometimes acts like an adult while other times as a 7-year-old. She cries when she is injured or throws things when she is mad. She is sometimes seen drawing pictures, playing games, or reading children's stories.\n* Throughout the whole manga series, she is never seen going to [[kindergarten]], although she nearly did take the [[National Center Test for University Admissions|high school entrance exam]].\n* Black Jack never tries to give Pinoko an 18-year-old body even though she wants to be bigger. She almost received one when she nearly died in Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\".\n* If she was an adult, she may have looked like the Pinoko in Black Jack's dream in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\".\n* She sometimes talks in third-person, using \"Pinoko\" instead of \"I\", \"me\", or \"my\".\n* Some of the stories take place when she is 18, other times 19, other times 20, and sometimes 21.\n* Pinoko got drunk from alcohol a few times.\n* She was temporarily adopted by a couple in Volume 17 Chapter 1: \"Pinoko is Adopted\".\n* Before Black Jack extracted her from her twin, she [[telepathic]]ally talked to him. That is why, in Volume 13 Chapter 4: \"Teratoid Cystoma, Part 2\", she was able to talk to a teratoid cystoma in a patient in her sleep.\n* Pinoko's main form of comic relief is yelling \u30a2\u30c3\u30c1\u30e7\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30b1(''Acchonburike'')\u2014a phrase that has no real meaning but taken as a rough equivalent to \"Oh my goodness!\" (often spelled \"Omigewdness\" in [[fansub]]s) or \"I don't believe it!\" (as translated when she appeared in an episode of the Astro Boy 80s series), in English\u2014while pressing her cheeks together with her hands when something surprising happens. In the 2004 English dub of the anime, she shouts \"Allamoby!\" Also, she says Aramanchu!, which has no real meaning, but can be roughly translated as \"okey dokey!\". Her name is derived from [[Pinocchio]].\n\n===Supporting characters===\n; Pinoko's Twin Sister\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratoid Cystoma\"\n* '''Pinoko's twin sister''''s name is never revealed in the manga. She doesn't like the fact that her teratoid cystoma is actually her twin sister. She would always look away and say that that ''thing'' isn't her sister. Her face and background is never revealed until Volume 17 Chapter 10: \"A Visiting Memory\".\n* Her second appearance is in Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\" where she donates some of her blood to Pinoko. She expresses hope that this would be the last time she would have to be involved with her, as she is engaged to be married.\n* Her third appearance is in Volume 17 Chapter 10: \"A Visiting Memory\" where her face and background are finally revealed. Dr. Crab tells Black Jack that she is actually the daughter of an important Buddhist line. She was constrained by pedigree and form. The family is always churning in drama, and she ended up deeply depressed. Then she tries to commit suicide by jumping from the third floor of her house. She survived and, with a huge amount of cash and amnesia, ended up at Black Jack's house. Pinoko and her had a sisterly bond despite neither knowing the identity of th eother. When she saw Dr. Crab, her memories returned and she quickly departed, having remembered the nature of her relationship to Pinoko. Pinoko didn't know who she really was, Black Jack did.\n\n; {{nihongo|Dr. Jotaro Honma|\u672c\u9593 \u4e08\u592a\u90ce|Honma J\u014dtar\u014d}}\n* Voiced by: [[Osamu Saka]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 5: \"Sometimes like Pearls\"\n* The reason why Black Jack pursued a career in medicine is because of '''Dr. Honma''', his mentor and life-saver, who acted as the young boy's father-figure. Kagemitsu Hazama, Black Jack's real father, left his wife and son to live in [[Macau]] with his new wife Renka. (The reasons for Kagemitsu's behavior are later explained in the Black Jack 21 series). As a child, Black Jack suffered from [[paralysis]] in all four limbs and spent many lonely years in a wheelchair until he regained the use of them. Dr. Honma wrote a book about this miracle, as depicted in Volume 1 Chapter 11: \"The Legs of an Ant\".\n* The medical community accused him of conducting a live experiment on a patient with a rare \"Honma's [[Hematoma]]\" and killed the patient. He was then forced to retire. When he died, Black Jack went through Dr. Honma's old files and found a letter addressed to him. Dr. Honma wanted Black Jack to find out the mystery of \"Honma's Hematoma\", but until he solve the mystery, to not operate on any patients who have it. Lumps of blood in the heart will form, even after many surgeries to get rid of them, they will come back. Because of that, many patients die of weak hearts. In Volume 13 Chapter 9: \"Honma's Hematoma\", Black Jack found the cure. The patient's heart will be replaced with an [[artificial heart]]. But it turns out that \"Honma's Hematoma\" is a [[disease]] caused by patients who already have artificial hearts.\n* Dr. Honma dies of old age in the episode four of Black Jack 4 Miracles of Life \"Just like a Pearl\" after a failed surgical attempt to revive him. However, he plays an important role in Black Jack 21, since he had once worked at the \"Noir Project\". In the manga, he dies in Volume 1 Chapter 5: \"Sometimes like Pearls.\"\n* He is seen in a dream in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\".\n* Dr. Honma is \"played\" by Saruta, a member of Tezuka's \"[[Osamu Tezuka's Star System|star system]]\" who appears in multiple volumes of Tezuka's ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' and other manga stories by Tezuka.\n\n; {{nihongo|Megumi Kisaragi|\u5982\u6708\u3081\u3050\u307f|Kisaragi Megumi}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 6: \"Confluence\"\n* '''Megumi Kisaragi''' is Black Jack's tragic love, whom he met and courted during their internship. Her first appearance was in Volume 1 Chapter 6: \"Confluence\" in the manga. She stayed up late at work and cared more about the patients than everyone else. She discovered that Kuroo Hazama had been the one looking after her whenever she walked alone at night. Later, she is revealed to have [[ovarian cancer]], and is afraid to tell Black Jack because of her fear that having these parts removed will interfere with their relationship. Nevertheless, the couple confesses their love before the operation while Megumi is \"still a woman\" (in reality, a [[hysterectomy]] or [[oophorectomy]] can affect sexual function, but the side effects associated with these procedures are not as extreme as those depicted in this story).\n* Afterwards, Megumi changed her name to Kei, a male name, and started living her life as a man, treating sick patients as a ship's doctor.\n* She is seen again in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\" on the same train as Black Jack.\n\n;  {{nihongo|Konomi Kuwata aka Black Queen|\u6851\u7530\u3053\u306e\u307f|Kuwata Konomi}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 9: \"Black Queen\"\n* First making her appearance in Volume 1 Chapter 9: \"Black Queen\", '''Kuwata Konomi''' was a doctor specializing in amputations, thought to be heartless by many, earning her the nickname 'Black Queen' in the medical world. She is engaged to Rock (referred to as Makube Rokuro in the TV series, probably to make up for the lack of \"Carved Seal\" episode), but her being infamous causes troubles for the couple. She met Black Jack, drunk, in a bar, naming herself as the Black Queen. The former is impressed by their similarities and falls in love with her, but he would eventually discover that Rock was her fianc\u00e9.\n* She is seen again two years after her first appearance, now in Volume 5 Chapter 5: \"The Last Train\". Her name is now Konomi Suzuki, after she married Rock. Half a year after Rock's surgery, they got married. She got fired and left for a plane to meet her husband.\n\n; Takashi\n* Voiced by: [[Kazuki Yao]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 7: \"Where Art Thou, Friend?\"\n* '''Takashi''' [[skin graft|grafted some of his skin]] to Black Jack when they were younger because Black Jack would always lend him his notes and help him with his homework. He donated 20&nbsp;cm x 20&nbsp;cm skin from his right buttock. Because he was of a mixed blood, half-African and half-Japanese, the skin that was surgically sewn onto Black Jack's face is tan. By the time Black Jack could remove the bandages from his body, Takashi had moved away. Years past and Black Jack started searching for Takashi. Takashi gave an unknown man a letter to deliver to Black Jack in [[Algiers]]. The letter explains that Takashi wanted to become a doctor who heals the earth but couldn't when he was slain in Algiers. He was a member of an environmentalist group which strongly opposed plans to build nuclear power plants in Africa. Now the skin on Black Jack's left side of his face became a memento. Black Jack considers him a friend.\n\n; Maestro Morozoff\n* Voiced by [[Kaneta Kimotsuki]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 11: \"Stradivarius\"\n* '''Maestro Morozoff''' is a world-famous violinist who sat beside Black Jack on a plane ride from Tokyo, using a route through the [[North Pole]]. The passengers on board stayed in an [[Eskimo]] village until the blizzard died down and a rescue team could come. He considers his violin to be his son. When he went out to search for his violin, he caught a severe case of frostbite. Because Black Jack left his medical equipments in the plane and the blizzard snowed in the door, Black Jack couldn't do anything. Realizing he couldn't play anymore when he saw his dead fingers on a tray, Morozoff decided to retire. When the blizzard came to an end, they buried his fingers near the village. When they left, the couple that let the passengers stay, found the violin. They decided to bury it with Morozoff's fingers.\n\n; {{nihongo|Biwamaru|\u7435\u7436\u4e38}}\n* Voiced by: [[Nachi Nozawa]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 14: \"The Blind [[Acupuncturist]]\"\n* '''Biwamaru''' is a wandering doctor who specializes in [[acupuncture]]. He made his first appearance in Volume 2 Chapter 14: \"The Blind [[Acupuncturist]]\" in the manga and episode 51 in the anime. He is blind, but he can walk on his own to many places, and goes wandering everywhere where his sensitive nose takes him, since he is able to smell out the whereabouts of people who are sick. He cures his patients without accepting any money in return, making him homeless. Biwamaru carries a walking stick and a huge purse-like bag with his medical equipment. He dislikes operations, saying that humans are not supposed to be operated on too many times and should depend on the healing power of their own bodies.\n* Biwamaru believes that his needle techniques are the solution to any medical problem. He often cures Black Jack's patients, causing Black Jack to feel unhappy and annoyed. One day he treated a patient of Black Jack's, a child; but he made a terrible mistake. He had thought that his needle techniques were perfect, but what he didn't know was that the small child had a [[fear of needles]], worsening her condition. Black Jack was furious and intended to show the proud Biwamaru his mistake. Later, Biwamaru cured Black Jack's large intestine, which Black Jack has attempted to treat through surgery, by piercing a needle into his foot in return for Black Jack's kindness in helping him fix his error with the patient.\n* He is seen again in Volume 5 Chapter 7: \"Two at the Baths\" in the Pitbottom Hot Springs. When he accompanied Black Jack to a skilled [[Bladesmith|swordsmith]] by the name of Hyo Jisai, the swordsmith knew that he needled 10,000 people, 200 of which are injured.\n\n; {{nihongo|Dr. Kiriko|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ad\u30ea\u30b3|''Dokut\u0101 Kiriko''}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 3 Chapter 9: \"Two Dark Doctors\"\n* '''Dr. Kiriko''', the \"death doctor\" (\"Reaper's Avatar\" in the manga), is another shadowy doctor, traveling the world like Black Jack. He wears an eye patch covering his left eye. When Kiriko was a [[military doctor]], he saw many patients in great pain, and came to practice [[euthanasia]]. He often appears in the manga, attempting to put down terminally ill patients whom Black Jack wants to save. He is so dedicated to euthanasia that he once attempted to commit suicide when he contracted a rare, infectious disease. Though arch-rivals, Kiriko and Black Jack have been in situations where they had to cooperate in order to survive or to accomplish a task, and manage to do so with good results. Whenever he is confronted by Black Jack after a successful operation which avoided the death alternative, Kiriko simply replies with something along the lines of \"I'm a doctor as well, you know.\" He only gives people death if they ask for it or the chances of survival is 0%, no suicide.\n* He is seen a second time in Volume 5 Chapter 6: \"There was a Valve!\", when he tries to kill yet another patient, which is his father who has [[pneumothorax]] for five years. Dr. Kiriko couldn't find the hole until Black Jack pumped oxygen into his [[trachea]] but it was hopeless. Dr. Kiriko injected poison into his system. He died in the operating room.\n* He is seen yet again in Volume 5 Chapter 10: \"99% Water\" on an uninhabited island; he has [[Gumma (pathology)|gumma]]. Yuri brought Black Jack to the island to find out how to cure him. Black Jack found out that gumma was caused by an amoeba, similar to a jellyfish, which consists of 99.9% water. You have to freeze it to see it.\n* He made another appearance in Volume 6 Chapter 14: \"Terror Virus\" in the manga.\n* He is seen a fifth time in Volume 8 Chapter 10:\"One Hour to Death\" when he bought a new drug called [[cardiotoxin]]. Anyone who drinks it will fall asleep, then their heartbeat will slow down and, in one hour, die.\n* He is seen for the sixth time in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\" on the same train as Black Jack.\n* 7th time in Volume 13 Chapter 6: \"A Fussy Suicide\"\n* 8th time in Volume 14 Chapter 6: \"Urashima\"\n* In the ''Clinical Chart'' OVA series, Dr. Kiriko is introduced only as [[Mozart]], in homage to his affinity for classical music. In this OVA, it is also shown that Kiriko does not charge immense amounts of money like Black Jack, nor did he consider his style of treatment as a 'solution to all sicknesses,' as demonstrated by his act of charity when he provided basic nutrients and some food to a patient suffering from what appeared to be severe [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] at one point.\n* In the same series of OVA, it is shown that he travels by motorcycle and has proficiency in mechanics and music.\n\n; {{nihongo|Tetsu (in the manga) aka Master|\u54f2\uff08\u3066\u3064\uff09|Tetsu}}\n* Voiced by: [[K\u014dsei Tomita]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 4 Chapter 7: \"Tetsu of the Yamanote Line\"\n* '''Tetsu''' is a [[pickpocket]]. He could pickpocket anyone on the [[Yamanote Line]] and they wouldn't know it. He can tell how much money people are holding from the nervous look in their eyes. The inspector in charge of him kept an eye on him, to catch him in action, and [[arrest]] him. When Tetsu followed a man, who he thinks have a lot of money, through the line, he ended up being surround by his [[gang]]. They took him to a back [[Alley#Japan|alley]] and cut off four of his fingers. The inspector, who was following him, found him in the alley. He took him to the hospital and had Black Jack operate on Tetsu. The inspector wanted Tetsu's fingers to be restored to before the accident, to how nimble they were. His fingers were fully restored when he showed the inspector his stole badge, pen, and wallet. Then they went out to drink.\n* His second appearance is in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\" when he is the [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] of an SL train.\n* In the anime, he has a steady role as the owner of Tom's, a coffee shop that Black Jack frequents. Owing his gratitude to Jotaro Honma, he fosters Kumiko and treats her as his daughter. In the past, he was a nameless magician who took up pickpocketing.\n* Tetsu is \"played\" by [[Shunsaku Ban]], a member of Tezuka's \"[[Osamu Tezuka's Star System|star system]]\" who appears in several manga stories by Tezuka.\n\n; {{nihongo|Largo|\u30e9\u30eb\u30b4|Rarugo}}\n* Voiced by: [[Makoto Ishii]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 4 Chapter 14: \"Thieving Dog\"\n* '''Largo''' was a stray dog found by Pinoko, Wato, and Sharaku during a car accident, in \"Thieving Dog\". Contrary to the manga, she is saved after an earthquake caused Black Jack's house to collapse on top of her, and she becomes his pet dog. She is named Largo for her lethargic nature, but she compensates with her sharp senses in detecting danger.\n* In the manga, she stole an umbrella from a stranger, causing her to get run over by a truck. Black Jack and Pinoko found her lying on the road. Black Jack refused to treat her but with Pinoko's screams, he treated her. Now she lives in a box, decorated by Pinoko, on the porch. She is an extremely lazy dog who uses a straw to drink water and takes two days to fetch the newspaper. It was her instinct as a dog, when she stole a necklace given to Black Jack by the President of Republic of [[Cainan]], to force Black Jack to chase her with the necklace out of the house.

Episode 27 of ''[[Astro Boy (1980 TV series)|Astro Boy]]'' brought together three separate Tezuka creations, as Astro, Uran, Doctor Roget (Black Jack) and Penny (Pinoko) travel back through time to 15th Century Molavia (Silverland). In this storyline, Black Jack performs a life-saving operation on a critically injured Princess Sapphire (from ''[[Ribbon no Kishi]]''), while Astro and Uran fend off Gor, a malevolent magician bent on usurping the throne. Characteristically, Roget/Black Jack refuses to operate until he is offered the key to the treasury vault, but later takes only one commemorative coin from the grateful court (which turns out to be worth $200,000,000 when he returns to Astro's time).\n\nBlack Jack also made a cameo appearance in the theatrical film ''[[Phoenix 2772]]'' as an interstellar prison warden, and is one of the main characters of the TV movie ''One Million-Year Trip: Bandar Book'', in which he plays the role of a space pirate, somehow similar in concept to [[Leiji Matsumoto]]'s [[Captain Harlock]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431960/ One Million-Year Trip: Bandar Book on the Internet Movie Database]</ref>\n\n===OVA===\nIn 1992, Tezuka's protege [[Osamu Dezaki]] directed a theatrical film and a ten [[OVA]] series which were released between 1993 and 2000.

Adapted from standalone manga chapters, ''Black Jack 21'' features an all-new overarching story line involving Jack's father and a powerful mysterious organization who try to assassinate Jack. Though the ''Black Jack 21'' series has never been licensed in the U.S., there are several subtitled versions available on the internet.\n\nThe previous two anime, ''Black Jack'' and ''Black Jack 21'', depart somewhat from the manga by changing the setting to the early 2000s, allowing for flat-screen LCD computer displays and other items not present in the 1973\u201383 manga. The episodes are based on chapters from the Black Jack manga, either in part or full, sometimes combining two stories in one episode, and also slightly modified to lighten stories' serious issues and overtones. Background and supporting characters such as Largo the dog, Wato, Sharaku and Hige were added and used for comic relief or to support Pinoko when the doctor was not present.\n\nOn 1 October 2015, a twelve episode anime entitled ''[[Young Black Jack]]'' began to air, about Black Jack's adventures as a medical student.  It is based on the November 2011 and ongoing spin-off manga of the same title written by Yoshiaki Tabata and illustrated by Y\u016bgo \u014ckuma. More closely following the timeline of the original 1973\u201383 manga by [[Osamu Tezuka]], the new anime is however somewhat discontinuous with the 2004 anime.\n\n<!-- There is an inherent contradiction in the following statement to the one above which needs correction. -->\nWhile ''Young Black Jack'' is set in the late 1960s against the backdrop of activism against the [[Vietnam War]], the 2004 anime is set in the early 2000s, representing nearly a 40-year time difference, even though Black Jack appears to have aged less than 10 years between them.\n\n===ONA===\nAn [[Original net animation|ONA]] adaptation of comprising 12 episodes also known as ''Black Jack Internet'' or ''Black Jack Flash'' was released in 2001\u20132002 and only available via a subscription online download.

Black Jack has also been animated into an [[OVA]], two television series (directed by Tezuka's son [[Makoto Tezuka]]) and two films. ''Black Jack'' is Tezuka's third most famous manga, after ''[[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]]'' and ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''. In 1977, it won the 1st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] for [[sh\u014dnen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |author=Joel Hahn |title=Kodansha Manga Awards |work=Comic Book Awards Almanac |accessdate=21 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816031310/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |archivedate=16 August 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[About.com]]'s Deb Aoki lists ''Black Jack'' as the best \"re-issue of previously released material\" of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/2008BestNewManga.htm|title=2008 Best New Manga|last=Aoki|first=Deb|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DtJu9fgL?url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/2008BestNewManga.htm|archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref> Osamu Dezaki's anime film adaptation, ''Black Jack The Movie'', won [[Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film|Best Animation Film]] at the 1996 [[Mainichi Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nMost of the stories involve Black Jack doing some good deed, for which he rarely gets recognition\u2014often curing the poor and destitute for free, or teaching the arrogant a lesson in humility. They sometimes end with a good, humane person enduring hardship, often unavoidable death, to save others.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n; Black Jack ''aka'' Kur\u014d Hazama\n{{main|Black Jack (manga character)}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 1: \"Is there a Doctor?\"\n\n; {{nihongo|Pinoko|\u30d4\u30ce\u30b3}}\n* Voiced by: [[Y\u016bko Mizutani]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratogenous Cystoma\"\n* '''Pinoko''' is Black Jack's loyal assistant/adopted daughter, who was actually a Teratogenous Cystoma (a growth more commonly known as a [[Teratoma#Fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma|teratoma]]). As seen in Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratogenous Cystoma\", she was a rare type of [[parasitic twin]], living as part of a patients' body for eighteen years.  When the presence of the twin was evidenced from a grotesque distortion in the host's body, Black Jack was contracted to extract and dispose of the growth.  In the end, he found the cystoma, although a collection of uncontained organs and muscles, was complete in design if not form.  Using life support to maintain them, Black Jack encased the assembly in an artificially constructed exoskeleton sized and shaped in the form of a female human child (around 7 or 8 years); miraculously, the homunculus survived with all sensory reception intact.  Her body is fully capable of walking, running, breathing and consuming and digesting food.  Only her [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and [[internal organ]]s are real; her face and body though artificial are remarkably human in design. Developing into a sentient though permanently child-sized life form, she was adopted by Black Jack as his informal ward.\n* She always helps the doctor by doing household chores and by even being his assistant in some of his operations. She often acts as [[comic relief]] in ''Black Jack'', claiming to be a girl of eighteen years of age and married to Black Jack, despite her childlike appearance and personality.  Her main value is companionship and source of affection for the ordinarily cold-natured doctor.\n* When she started living with Black Jack, she couldn't cook, clean, or take care of the house; she couldn't even walk, let alone move. Eventually, she learned them and could take care of the house when he is out. But sometimes she is able to mix ingredients around in her cooking, like using salt instead of sugar.\n* Black Jack thinks of her as his daughter while she thinks of herself as his wife.\n* Black Jack modeled her face after a cute girl he had seen in a medical journal who suffers from a lung ailment of unknown origin (from Volume 7 Chapter 4: \"The Two Pinokos\").\n* Pinoko's life was put in danger a few times; she was kidnapped (Volume 2 Chapter 8: \"Kidnapping\", Volume 14 Chapter 2: \"The Third Call\", Volume 15 Chapter 1: \"Treasure Island\"), swallowed a [[potassium cyanide]] pill (Volume 4 Chapter 12: \"Gas\"), shot from a bullet (Volume 7 Chapter 10: \"Black and White\"), crashed a car (Volume 8 Chapter 8: \"A Visit from a Killer\"), and caught an aggressive form of [[leukemia]] (Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\").\n* Pinoko says she is 18 years old because that is how long she was in her sister's body, but Black Jack says she is 0-years-old when he built her. Because of that, she sometimes acts like an adult while other times as a 7-year-old. She cries when she is injured or throws things when she is mad. She is sometimes seen drawing pictures, playing games, or reading children's stories.\n* Throughout the whole manga series, she is never seen going to [[kindergarten]], although she nearly did take the [[National Center Test for University Admissions|high school entrance exam]].\n* Black Jack never tries to give Pinoko an 18-year-old body even though she wants to be bigger. She almost received one when she nearly died in Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\".\n* If she was an adult, she may have looked like the Pinoko in Black Jack's dream in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\".\n* She sometimes talks in third-person, using \"Pinoko\" instead of \"I\", \"me\", or \"my\".\n* Some of the stories take place when she is 18, other times 19, other times 20, and sometimes 21.\n* Pinoko got drunk from alcohol a few times.\n* She was temporarily adopted by a couple in Volume 17 Chapter 1: \"Pinoko is Adopted\".\n* Before Black Jack extracted her from her twin, she [[telepathic]]ally talked to him. That is why, in Volume 13 Chapter 4: \"Teratoid Cystoma, Part 2\", she was able to talk to a teratoid cystoma in a patient in her sleep.\n* Pinoko's main form of comic relief is yelling \u30a2\u30c3\u30c1\u30e7\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30b1(''Acchonburike'')\u2014a phrase that has no real meaning but taken as a rough equivalent to \"Oh my goodness!\" (often spelled \"Omigewdness\" in [[fansub]]s) or \"I don't believe it!\" (as translated when she appeared in an episode of the Astro Boy 80s series), in English\u2014while pressing her cheeks together with her hands when something surprising happens. In the 2004 English dub of the anime, she shouts \"Allamoby!\" Also, she says Aramanchu!, which has no real meaning, but can be roughly translated as \"okey dokey!\". Her name is derived from [[Pinocchio]].\n\n===Supporting characters===\n; Pinoko's Twin Sister\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: \"Teratoid Cystoma\"\n* '''Pinoko's twin sister''''s name is never revealed in the manga. She doesn't like the fact that her teratoid cystoma is actually her twin sister. She would always look away and say that that ''thing'' isn't her sister. Her face and background is never revealed until Volume 17 Chapter 10: \"A Visiting Memory\".\n* Her second appearance is in Volume 9 Chapter 2: \"Pinoko Lives\" where she donates some of her blood to Pinoko. She expresses hope that this would be the last time she would have to be involved with her, as she is engaged to be married.\n* Her third appearance is in Volume 17 Chapter 10: \"A Visiting Memory\" where her face and background are finally revealed. Dr. Crab tells Black Jack that she is actually the daughter of an important Buddhist line. She was constrained by pedigree and form. The family is always churning in drama, and she ended up deeply depressed. Then she tries to commit suicide by jumping from the third floor of her house. She survived and, with a huge amount of cash and amnesia, ended up at Black Jack's house. Pinoko and her had a sisterly bond despite neither knowing the identity of th eother. When she saw Dr. Crab, her memories returned and she quickly departed, having remembered the nature of her relationship to Pinoko. Pinoko didn't know who she really was, Black Jack did.\n\n; {{nihongo|Dr. Jotaro Honma|\u672c\u9593 \u4e08\u592a\u90ce|Honma J\u014dtar\u014d}}\n* Voiced by: [[Osamu Saka]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 5: \"Sometimes like Pearls\"\n* The reason why Black Jack pursued a career in medicine is because of '''Dr. Honma''', his mentor and life-saver, who acted as the young boy's father-figure. Kagemitsu Hazama, Black Jack's real father, left his wife and son to live in [[Macau]] with his new wife Renka. (The reasons for Kagemitsu's behavior are later explained in the Black Jack 21 series). As a child, Black Jack suffered from [[paralysis]] in all four limbs and spent many lonely years in a wheelchair until he regained the use of them. Dr. Honma wrote a book about this miracle, as depicted in Volume 1 Chapter 11: \"The Legs of an Ant\".\n* The medical community accused him of conducting a live experiment on a patient with a rare \"Honma's [[Hematoma]]\" and killed the patient. He was then forced to retire. When he died, Black Jack went through Dr. Honma's old files and found a letter addressed to him. Dr. Honma wanted Black Jack to find out the mystery of \"Honma's Hematoma\", but until he solve the mystery, to not operate on any patients who have it. Lumps of blood in the heart will form, even after many surgeries to get rid of them, they will come back. Because of that, many patients die of weak hearts. In Volume 13 Chapter 9: \"Honma's Hematoma\", Black Jack found the cure. The patient's heart will be replaced with an [[artificial heart]]. But it turns out that \"Honma's Hematoma\" is a [[disease]] caused by patients who already have artificial hearts.\n* Dr. Honma dies of old age in the episode four of Black Jack 4 Miracles of Life \"Just like a Pearl\" after a failed surgical attempt to revive him. However, he plays an important role in Black Jack 21, since he had once worked at the \"Noir Project\". In the manga, he dies in Volume 1 Chapter 5: \"Sometimes like Pearls.\"\n* He is seen in a dream in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\".\n* Dr. Honma is \"played\" by Saruta, a member of Tezuka's \"[[Osamu Tezuka's Star System|star system]]\" who appears in multiple volumes of Tezuka's ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' and other manga stories by Tezuka.\n\n; {{nihongo|Megumi Kisaragi|\u5982\u6708\u3081\u3050\u307f|Kisaragi Megumi}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 6: \"Confluence\"\n* '''Megumi Kisaragi''' is Black Jack's tragic love, whom he met and courted during their internship. Her first appearance was in Volume 1 Chapter 6: \"Confluence\" in the manga. She stayed up late at work and cared more about the patients than everyone else. She discovered that Kuroo Hazama had been the one looking after her whenever she walked alone at night. Later, she is revealed to have [[ovarian cancer]], and is afraid to tell Black Jack because of her fear that having these parts removed will interfere with their relationship. Nevertheless, the couple confesses their love before the operation while Megumi is \"still a woman\" (in reality, a [[hysterectomy]] or [[oophorectomy]] can affect sexual function, but the side effects associated with these procedures are not as extreme as those depicted in this story).\n* Afterwards, Megumi changed her name to Kei, a male name, and started living her life as a man, treating sick patients as a ship's doctor.\n* She is seen again in Volume 11 Chapter 14: \"The SL Called Life\" on the same train as Black Jack.\n\n;  {{nihongo|Konomi Kuwata aka Black Queen|\u6851\u7530\u3053\u306e\u307f|Kuwata Konomi}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 9: \"Black Queen\"\n* First making her appearance in Volume 1 Chapter 9: \"Black Queen\", '''Kuwata Konomi''' was a doctor specializing in amputations, thought to be heartless by many, earning her the nickname 'Black Queen' in the medical world. She is engaged to Rock (referred to as Makube Rokuro in the TV series, probably to make up for the lack of \"Carved Seal\" episode), but her being infamous causes troubles for the couple. She met Black Jack, drunk, in a bar, naming herself as the Black Queen. The former is impressed by their similarities and falls in love with her, but he would eventually discover that Rock was her fianc\u00e9.\n* She is seen again two years after her first appearance, now in Volume 5 Chapter 5: \"The Last Train\". Her name is now Konomi Suzuki, after she married Rock. Half a year after Rock's surgery, they got married. She got fired and left for a plane to meet her husband.\n\n; Takashi\n* Voiced by: [[Kazuki Yao]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 7: \"Where Art Thou, Friend?\"\n* '''Takashi''' [[skin graft|grafted some of his skin]] to Black Jack when they were younger because Black Jack would always lend him his notes and help him with his homework. He donated 20&nbsp;cm x 20&nbsp;cm skin from his right buttock. Because he was of a mixed blood, half-African and half-Japanese, the skin that was surgically sewn onto Black Jack's face is tan. By the time Black Jack could remove the bandages from his body, Takashi had moved away. Years past and Black Jack started searching for Takashi. Takashi gave an unknown man a letter to deliver to Black Jack in [[Algiers]]. The letter explains that Takashi wanted to become a doctor who heals the earth but couldn't when he was slain in Algiers. He was a member of an environmentalist group which strongly opposed plans to build nuclear power plants in Africa. Now the skin on Black Jack's left side of his face became a memento. Black Jack considers him a friend.\n\n; Maestro Morozoff\n* Voiced by [[Kaneta Kimotsuki]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 11: \"Stradivarius\"\n* '''Maestro Morozoff''' is a world-famous violinist who sat beside Black Jack on a plane ride from Tokyo, using a route through the [[North Pole]]. The passengers on board stayed in an [[Eskimo]] village until the blizzard died down and a rescue team could come. He considers his violin to be his son. When he went out to search for his violin, he caught a severe case of frostbite. Because Black Jack left his medical equipments in the plane and the blizzard snowed in the door, Black Jack couldn't do anything. Realizing he couldn't play anymore when he saw his dead fingers on a tray, Morozoff decided to retire. When the blizzard came to an end, they buried his fingers near the village. When they left, the couple that let the passengers stay, found the violin. They decided to bury it with Morozoff's fingers.\n\n; {{nihongo|Biwamaru|\u7435\u7436\u4e38}}\n* Voiced by: [[Nachi Nozawa]]\n* First Appearance: Volume 2 Chapter 14: \"The Blind [[Acupuncturist]]\"\n* '''Biwamaru''' is a wandering doctor who specializes in [[acupuncture]]. He made his first appearance in Volume 2 Chapter 14: \"The Blind [[Acupuncturist]]\" in the manga and episode 51 in the anime. He is blind, but he can walk on his own to many places, and goes wandering everywhere where his sensitive nose takes him, since he is able to smell out the whereabouts of people who are sick. He cures his patients without accepting any money in return, making him homeless. Biwamaru carries a walking stick and a huge purse-like bag with his medical equipment. He dislikes operations, saying that humans are not supposed to be operated on too many times and should depend on the healing power of their own bodies.\n* Biwamaru believes that his needle techniques are the solution to any medical problem. He often cures Black Jack's patients, causing Black Jack to feel unhappy and annoyed. One day he treated a patient of Black Jack's, a child; but he made a terrible mistake. He had thought that his needle techniques were perfect, but what he didn't know was that the small child had a [[fear of needles]], worsening her condition. Black Jack was furious and intended to show the proud Biwamaru his mistake. Later, Biwamaru cured Black Jack's large intestine, which Black Jack has attempted to treat through surgery, by piercing a needle into his foot in return for Black Jack's kindness in helping him fix his error with the patient.\n* He is seen again in Volume 5 Chapter 7: \"Two at the Baths\" in the Pitbottom Hot Springs. When he accompanied Black Jack to a skilled [[Bladesmith|swordsmith]] by the name of Hyo Jisai, the swordsmith knew that he needled 10,000 people, 200 of which are injured.\n\n; {{nihongo|Dr. Kiriko|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ad\u30ea\u30b3|''Dokut\u0101 Kiriko''}}\n* First Appearance: Volume 3 Chapter 9: \"Two Dark Doctors\"\n* '''Dr. Kiriko''', the \"death doctor\" (\"Reaper's Avatar\" in the manga), is another shadowy doctor, traveling the world like Black Jack. He wears an eye patch covering his left eye. When Kiriko was a [[military doctor]], he saw many patients in great pain, and came to practice [[euthanasia]].

Episode 27 of ''[[Astro Boy (1980 TV series)|Astro Boy]]'' brought together three separate Tezuka creations, as Astro, Uran, Doctor Roget (Black Jack) and Penny (Pinoko) travel back through time to 15th Century Molavia (Silverland). In this storyline, Black Jack performs a life-saving operation on a critically injured Princess Sapphire (from ''[[Ribbon no Kishi]]''), while Astro and Uran fend off Gor, a malevolent magician bent on usurping the throne. Characteristically, Roget/Black Jack refuses to operate until he is offered the key to the treasury vault, but later takes only one commemorative coin from the grateful court (which turns out to be worth $200,000,000 when he returns to Astro's time).\n\nBlack Jack also made a cameo appearance in the theatrical film ''[[Phoenix 2772]]'' as an interstellar prison warden, and is one of the main characters of the TV movie ''One Million-Year Trip: Bandar Book'', in which he plays the role of a space pirate, somehow similar in concept to [[Leiji Matsumoto]]'s [[Captain Harlock]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431960/ One Million-Year Trip: Bandar Book on the Internet Movie Database]</ref>\n\n===OVA===\nIn 1992, Tezuka's protege [[Osamu Dezaki]] directed a theatrical film and a ten [[OVA]] series which were released between 1993 and 2000.

Adapted from standalone manga chapters, ''Black Jack 21'' features an all-new overarching story line involving Jack's father and a powerful mysterious organization who try to assassinate Jack. Though the ''Black Jack 21'' series has never been licensed in the U.S., there are several subtitled versions available on the internet.\n\nThe previous two anime, ''Black Jack'' and ''Black Jack 21'', depart somewhat from the manga by changing the setting to the early 2000s, allowing for flat-screen LCD computer displays and other items not present in the 1973\u201383 manga. The episodes are based on chapters from the Black Jack manga, either in part or full, sometimes combining two stories in one episode, and also slightly modified to lighten stories' serious issues and overtones. Background and supporting characters such as Largo the dog, Wato, Sharaku and Hige were added and used for comic relief or to support Pinoko when the doctor was not present.\n\nOn 1 October 2015, a twelve episode anime entitled ''[[Young Black Jack]]'' began to air, about Black Jack's adventures as a medical student.  It is based on the November 2011 and ongoing spin-off manga of the same title written by Yoshiaki Tabata and illustrated by Y\u016bgo \u014ckuma. More closely following the timeline of the original 1973\u201383 manga by [[Osamu Tezuka]], the new anime is however somewhat discontinuous with the 2004 anime.\n\n<!-- There is an inherent contradiction in the following statement to the one above which needs correction. -->\nWhile ''Young Black Jack'' is set in the late 1960s against the backdrop of activism against the [[Vietnam War]], the 2004 anime is set in the early 2000s, representing nearly a 40-year time difference, even though Black Jack appears to have aged less than 10 years between them.\n\n===ONA===\nAn [[Original net animation|ONA]] adaptation of comprising 12 episodes also known as ''Black Jack Internet'' or ''Black Jack Flash'' was released in 2001\u20132002 and only available via a subscription online download.
