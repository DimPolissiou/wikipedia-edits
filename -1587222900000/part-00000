Records]]. Produced by the band and [[Scott Litt]] and recorded at four studios, the album was an intentional stylistic shift from R.E.M.'s previous two albums ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), with loud, distorted guitar tones and simple arrangements. [[Michael Stipe]]'s lyrics at times deal with the nature of celebrity, and some are sung from the viewpoint of a character.\n\nLed by the successful single \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\", ''Monster'' debuted at number one in the United States and at least seven other countries, and received generally positive reviews. Four more singles were released from the album, including the UK top-20 hits \"[[Bang and Blame]]\", \"[[Strange Currencies]]\", and \"[[Tongue (song)|Tongue]]\". That year, the band promoted the album with their first concert tour since 1989; although the tour was commercially successful, band members suffered several health problems. The album's follow-up ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) was primarily recorded during the tour.\n\n==Recording==\nEarly in 1993, R.E.M. convened a four-day meeting in [[Acapulco]] to plan their next two years. The group agreed on a plan for 1994 through 1996, which included recording a new album and touring to promote it.<ref name=\"cavanagh\">Cavanagh, David. \"Tune In, Cheer Up, Rock Out\". ''Q''. October 1994.</ref> Drummer [[Bill Berry]] was particularly eager to tour (which the band had not done since 1989), and insisted that the album \"rock\". The band agreed that after ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'', they did not want to record another slow-paced album.<ref name=\"buckley236\">Buckley, p. 236</ref>\n\nLater that year, R.E.M. began recording their ninth album.<ref name=\"buckley236\" /> Pre-production took place at Kingsway Studio in [[New Orleans]] under the supervision of Mark Howard, who had worked on ''Automatic for the People''.<ref name=\"Buckley, p. 237\">Buckley, p. 237</ref> Guitarist [[Peter Buck]] said that the band wrote 45 songs, including \"a whole album's worth of acoustic stuff\" which they demoed.<ref name=\"cavanagh\" /> According to Howard, the sessions were experimental: \"The bass had a tremolo sound on it. It was a more inventive session for them.\" The studio did not have a control room, so Howard recorded Michael Stipe singing lyrical ideas while lying on a couch: \"Being able to put those vocals down helped him write the lyrics to a lot of songs on ''Monster''.\"<ref name=\"buckley238\">Buckley, p. 238</ref> When the sessions were finished Howard played the recordings to co-producer Scott Litt, who had worked with the band since their fifth album (''[[Document (album)|Document]]'', 1987).<ref name=\"Buckley, p. 237\"/>\n\n[[File:North Miami FL Criteria Studios01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=White building with a hedge and palm trees in front|Part of ''Monster'' was recorded at [[Criteria Studios]].]]\nIn February 1994, the band moved to Crossover Soundstage in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. At Crossover, most of the album's basic tracks were recorded live as if the band were playing in concert. Litt said, \"I thought since they hadn't toured in a while, it would be good for them to get into that mind-set\u2014you know, monitors, PA, standing up\".<ref name=\"monster madness\">DeCurtis, Anthony. {{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/monster-madness-19941020|title=\"Monster Madness\" |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}. ''Rolling Stone''. October 20, 1994. Retrieved on May 6, 2010.</ref> The sessions were hampered by several events, including Berry and bassist [[Mike Mills]] falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members and the deaths of Stipe's friends, actor [[River Phoenix]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] lead singer [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref name=\"buckley238\" /> The band wrote and recorded \"Let Me In\" in tribute to Cobain and dedicated the album to Phoenix,<ref name=\"monster madness\" /> whose sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] provided background vocals on \"[[Bang and Blame]]\".\n\nIn late April 1994 the band relocated to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami, Florida]], but recording was interrupted because Stipe had an abscessed tooth.<ref>Black, p. 204</ref> Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production moved to [[Ocean Way Recording]] in [[Los Angeles]] the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"We're trying to figure out how raw to leave it and how much to studiofy it.\" Stipe was still writing songs when the band was supposed to be mixing the album. Tensions arose among the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time.<ref name=\"monster madness\" /> The situation came to a head when the group was recording at Louie's Clubhouse (Litt's home studio in Los Angeles); years later, Stipe recalled, \"We broke up ... We reached the point where none of us could speak to each other, and we were in a small room, and we just said 'Fuck off' and that was it.\"<ref>Black, p. 205</ref> The group met to resolve their issues; Mills told ''Rolling Stone'', \"We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven't been doing very well lately.\"<ref name=\"monster madness\" />\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen|filename=R.E.M. - What's the Frequency, Kenneth?.ogg|title=\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" |description=Sample of \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\", the first single from ''Monster''. The song's loud, distorted guitars were an intentional departure from R.E.M.'s previous two albums.}}\n\nUnlike R.E.M.'s previous two albums, ''Monster'' incorporated distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s [[glam rock]]. Peter Buck described the album as \"a 'rock' record, with the 'rock' in quotation marks.\" He explained, \"That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a [[Nudge Nudge|nudge, nudge, wink, wink]] feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?\"<ref name=\"buckley236\" /> Mike Mills told ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', \"On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be.\"<ref>Farley, Christopher John. \"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981499,00.html Monster Music R.E.M., One Of]\".

The band has called it a \"foxy, in-your-face, [[punk rock]], trashed and stupid\" record.<ref name=\"punkrock\" /> \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\", \"[[Crush with Eyeliner]]\" and \"Circus Envy\" have been described as glam rock.<ref name=\"punkrock\" />\n\nStipe wrote ''Monster''{{'s}} lyrics in character; this, according to biographer Dan Buckley, \"set the real Stipe at a distance from the mask adopted for each song.\" The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and \"the creepiness of fandom as pathology\".<ref>Buckley, p. 241</ref> Buck called the album a reaction to the band's popularity: \"When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't know who they are, because they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him.\"<ref>Buckley, p. 243-44</ref> The band noted that at the end of certain songs, they left blank choruses (where Mills and Berry would usually sing harmony) so fans could sing along.<ref name=\"cavanagh\" />\n\n\"The song 'Let Me In' is me on the phone to [[Kurt Cobain|Kurt]], trying to get him out of the frame of mind he was in,\" said Stipe. \"I wanted him to know he didn't need to pay attention to all this; that he was going to make it through. I know what the next [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] record was going to sound like. It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little angry at him for [[Death of Kurt Cobain|killing himself]]. He and I were going to make a trial run of the album. It was set up. He had a plane ticket. At the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.{{'\"}}<ref>quoted in ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', issue date unknown; original source unknown</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe [[cover art]] features a blurred drawing of a bear's head against an orange background. The concept originated when Stipe showed cover artist Chris Bilheimer a balloon he wanted to use as the [[album cover]] and told him to \"play around with\". Bilheimer changed the color of the balloon (which was originally green), and re-photographed the bear head. When he was down to the last few frames on a roll of film, he took a few photos without bothering to focus the shots (which he and Stipe ended up liking the best).<ref>Buckley, p. 247</ref> The jewel case of the original CD release of ''Monster'' also featured an orange polystyrene media tray, akin to the yellow one used for the ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' CD.\n\nThe back cover has the body of the bear next to the track listing, and the inside sleeve features images of the cartoon character [[Migraine Boy]]. \"I lifted Migraine Boy from the ''[[Flagpole Magazine|Flagpole]]'',\" Stipe told Molly McCommons, his 12-year-old interviewer and daughter of ''Flagpole'' editor Pete McCommons. \"I'd like to officially thank ''Flagpole'' for introducing me to Greg Fiering and Migraine Boy. I haven't met Greg, but I've talked to him a lot on the phone. We were actually in [[San Francisco]] at the same time, but I was working on another project and we had a television visit for about two hours. This is an exclusive. I don't think anybody else knows about Migraine Boy yet.\"<ref>''[[Flagpole Magazine|Flagpole]]'', September 1994</ref>\n\nThe booklet contains several alternate names and working titles of songs recorded for the album. In interviews, the band has described its process of naming albums: they tape a large sheet of paper on the studio wall, and then write down random ideas as they occur. One song mentioned on the list is \"Revolution\", an outtake which later appeared on the ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' soundtrack and the bonus disc of ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988\u20132003]]''. \"Yes, I Am Fucking with You\" was the working title of \"King of Comedy\".<ref name=\"monster madness\" />\n\nThe limited-edition deluxe CD was packaged with a 52-page hardcover book of photographs and artwork (including Migraine Boy), similar to the visual extras in other 1980s and 1990s limited-edition R.E.M. albums (which were usually overseen and directed by Stipe). The ''Monster'' book also included an [[obi strip]] and a different design printed on the disc itself, which fitted into a die-cut, star-shaped opening inside the book's cover.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 83/100<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/monster-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/rem|title=Monster [25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition] by R.E.M.|website=[[Metacritic]]|date=November 1, 2019|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/monster-mw0000119158 |title=''Monster''&nbsp;\u2013 R.E.M. |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2score = {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Back Catalogue: R.E.M. |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |issue=67 |date=March 2008 |page=106}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3score = {{rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-27/entertainment/9411270042_1_star-band-uber |title=R.E.M.'s Best Album Side?

The tour, which played arenas and amphitheaters, began in January 1995 with shows in Australia and Japan and continued throughout Europe and the United States for the rest of the year. Support acts included [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Radiohead]]. Although the tour was a commercial success, it was difficult for the group.<ref>Buckley, p. 248</ref> On March 1, Berry collapsed onstage during a performance in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]] due to a [[brain aneurysm]]. He had surgery immediately, and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was the beginning of a series of health problems for the band; Mills had surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July, and a month later Stipe had emergency surgery to repair a [[hernia]].<ref>Buckley, p. 251\u201355</ref> However, the group composed and debuted a number of new songs on the tour and recorded most of ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (their next album) on the road.

The edition contains remastered, live and demo versions of the songs from the album, as well as, unusually, a CD containing a fully remixed version of the album. The remix was the brainchild of original producer Scott Litt, who had long regretted the original mixing job he had done on ''Monster'', which involved distortion and vocals low in the mix, in keeping with the [[grunge]] style popular at the time.<ref name=\"revisiting monster\">{{cite web |title=R.E.M.

Records]]. Produced by the band and [[Scott Litt]] and recorded at four studios, the album was an intentional stylistic shift from R.E.M.'s previous two albums ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), with loud, distorted guitar tones and simple arrangements. [[Michael Stipe]]'s lyrics at times deal with the nature of celebrity, and some are sung from the viewpoint of a character.\n\nLed by the successful single \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\", ''Monster'' debuted at number one in the United States and at least seven other countries, and received generally positive reviews. Four more singles were released from the album, including the UK top-20 hits \"[[Bang and Blame]]\", \"[[Strange Currencies]]\", and \"[[Tongue (song)|Tongue]]\". That year, the band promoted the album with their first concert tour since 1989; although the tour was commercially successful, band members suffered several health problems. The album's follow-up ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) was primarily recorded during the tour.\n\n==Recording==\nEarly in 1993, R.E.M. convened a four-day meeting in [[Acapulco]] to plan their next two years. The group agreed on a plan for 1994 through 1996, which included recording a new album and touring to promote it.<ref name=\"cavanagh\">Cavanagh, David. \"Tune In, Cheer Up, Rock Out\". ''Q''. October 1994.</ref> Drummer [[Bill Berry]] was particularly eager to tour (which the band had not done since 1989), and insisted that the album \"rock\". The band agreed that after ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'', they did not want to record another slow-paced album.<ref name=\"buckley236\">Buckley, p. 236</ref>\n\nLater that year, R.E.M. began recording their ninth album.<ref name=\"buckley236\" /> Pre-production took place at Kingsway Studio in [[New Orleans]] under the supervision of Mark Howard, who had worked on ''Automatic for the People''.<ref name=\"Buckley, p. 237\">Buckley, p. 237</ref> Guitarist [[Peter Buck]] said that the band wrote 45 songs, including \"a whole album's worth of acoustic stuff\" which they demoed.<ref name=\"cavanagh\" /> According to Howard, the sessions were experimental: \"The bass had a tremolo sound on it. It was a more inventive session for them.\" The studio did not have a control room, so Howard recorded Michael Stipe singing lyrical ideas while lying on a couch: \"Being able to put those vocals down helped him write the lyrics to a lot of songs on ''Monster''.\"<ref name=\"buckley238\">Buckley, p. 238</ref> When the sessions were finished Howard played the recordings to co-producer Scott Litt, who had worked with the band since their fifth album (''[[Document (album)|Document]]'', 1987).<ref name=\"Buckley, p. 237\"/>\n\n[[File:North Miami FL Criteria Studios01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=White building with a hedge and palm trees in front|Part of ''Monster'' was recorded at [[Criteria Studios]].]]\nIn February 1994, the band moved to Crossover Soundstage in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. At Crossover, most of the album's basic tracks were recorded live as if the band were playing in concert. Litt said, \"I thought since they hadn't toured in a while, it would be good for them to get into that mind-set\u2014you know, monitors, PA, standing up\".<ref name=\"monster madness\">DeCurtis, Anthony. {{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/monster-madness-19941020|title=\"Monster Madness\" |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}. ''Rolling Stone''. October 20, 1994. Retrieved on May 6, 2010.</ref> The sessions were hampered by several events, including Berry and bassist [[Mike Mills]] falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members and the deaths of Stipe's friends, actor [[River Phoenix]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] lead singer [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref name=\"buckley238\" /> The band wrote and recorded \"Let Me In\" in tribute to Cobain and dedicated the album to Phoenix,<ref name=\"monster madness\" /> whose sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] provided background vocals on \"[[Bang and Blame]]\".\n\nIn late April 1994 the band relocated to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami, Florida]], but recording was interrupted because Stipe had an abscessed tooth.<ref>Black, p. 204</ref> Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production moved to [[Ocean Way Recording]] in [[Los Angeles]] the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"We're trying to figure out how raw to leave it and how much to studiofy it.\" Stipe was still writing songs when the band was supposed to be mixing the album. Tensions arose among the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time.<ref name=\"monster madness\" /> The situation came to a head when the group was recording at Louie's Clubhouse (Litt's home studio in Los Angeles); years later, Stipe recalled, \"We broke up ... We reached the point where none of us could speak to each other, and we were in a small room, and we just said 'Fuck off' and that was it.\"<ref>Black, p. 205</ref> The group met to resolve their issues; Mills told ''Rolling Stone'', \"We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven't been doing very well lately.\"<ref name=\"monster madness\" />\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen|filename=R.E.M. - What's the Frequency, Kenneth?.ogg|title=\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" |description=Sample of \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\", the first single from ''Monster''. The song's loud, distorted guitars were an intentional departure from R.E.M.'s previous two albums.}}\n\nUnlike R.E.M.'s previous two albums, ''Monster'' incorporated distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s [[glam rock]]. Peter Buck described the album as \"a 'rock' record, with the 'rock' in quotation marks.\" He explained, \"That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a [[Nudge Nudge|nudge, nudge, wink, wink]] feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?\"<ref name=\"buckley236\" /> Mike Mills told ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', \"On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it.

The band has called it a \"foxy, in-your-face, [[punk rock]], trashed and stupid\" record.<ref name=\"punkrock\" /> \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\", \"[[Crush with Eyeliner]]\" and \"Circus Envy\" have been described as glam rock.<ref name=\"punkrock\" />\n\nStipe wrote ''Monster''{{'s}} lyrics in character; this, according to biographer Dan Buckley, \"set the real Stipe at a distance from the mask adopted for each song.\" The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and \"the creepiness of fandom as pathology\".<ref>Buckley, p. 241</ref> Buck called the album a reaction to the band's popularity: \"When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't know who they are, because they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him.\"<ref>Buckley, p. 243-44</ref> The band noted that at the end of certain songs, they left blank choruses (where Mills and Berry would usually sing harmony) so fans could sing along.<ref name=\"cavanagh\" />\n\n\"The song 'Let Me In' is me on the phone to [[Kurt Cobain|Kurt]], trying to get him out of the frame of mind he was in,\" said Stipe. \"I wanted him to know he didn't need to pay attention to all this; that he was going to make it through. I know what the next [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] record was going to sound like. It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little angry at him for [[Death of Kurt Cobain|killing himself]]. He and I were going to make a trial run of the album. It was set up. He had a plane ticket. At the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.{{'\"}}<ref>quoted in ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', issue date unknown; original source unknown</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe [[cover art]] features a blurred drawing of a bear's head against an orange background. The concept originated when Stipe showed cover artist Chris Bilheimer a balloon he wanted to use as the [[album cover]] and told him to \"play around with\". Bilheimer changed the color of the balloon (which was originally green), and re-photographed the bear head. When he was down to the last few frames on a roll of film, he took a few photos without bothering to focus the shots (which he and Stipe ended up liking the best).<ref>Buckley, p. 247</ref> The jewel case of the original CD release of ''Monster'' also featured an orange polystyrene media tray, akin to the yellow one used for the ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' CD.\n\nThe back cover has the body of the bear next to the track listing, and the inside sleeve features images of the cartoon character [[Migraine Boy]]. \"I lifted Migraine Boy from the ''[[Flagpole Magazine|Flagpole]]'',\" Stipe told Molly McCommons, his 12-year-old interviewer and daughter of ''Flagpole'' editor Pete McCommons. \"I'd like to officially thank ''Flagpole'' for introducing me to Greg Fiering and Migraine Boy. I haven't met Greg, but I've talked to him a lot on the phone. We were actually in [[San Francisco]] at the same time, but I was working on another project and we had a television visit for about two hours. This is an exclusive. I don't think anybody else knows about Migraine Boy yet.\"<ref>''[[Flagpole Magazine|Flagpole]]'', September 1994</ref>\n\nThe booklet contains several alternate names and working titles of songs recorded for the album. In interviews, the band has described its process of naming albums: they tape a large sheet of paper on the studio wall, and then write down random ideas as they occur. One song mentioned on the list is \"Revolution\", an outtake which later appeared on the ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' soundtrack and the bonus disc of ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988\u20132003]]''. \"Yes, I Am Fucking with You\" was the working title of \"King of Comedy\".<ref name=\"monster madness\" />\n\nThe limited-edition deluxe CD was packaged with a 52-page hardcover book of photographs and artwork (including Migraine Boy), similar to the visual extras in other 1980s and 1990s limited-edition R.E.M. albums (which were usually overseen and directed by Stipe). The ''Monster'' book also included an [[obi strip]] and a different design printed on the disc itself, which fitted into a die-cut, star-shaped opening inside the book's cover.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 83/100<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/monster-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/rem|title=Monster [25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition] by R.E.M.|website=[[Metacritic]]|date=November 1, 2019|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/monster-mw0000119158 |title=''Monster''&nbsp;\u2013 R.E.M. |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2score = {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Back Catalogue: R.E.M. |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |issue=67 |date=March 2008 |page=106}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3score = {{rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-27/entertainment/9411270042_1_star-band-uber |title=R.E.M.'s Best Album Side?

For the U.S. side, the battle proved the deadliest entanglement of [[Operation Anaconda]], an effort early in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] to rout al-Qaeda forces from the [[Shahi-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]]. The battle saw three helicopter landings by the U.S. on the mountain top, each greeted by direct assault from al-Qaeda forces. Although Takur Ghar was eventually taken, seven U.S. service members were killed and many wounded. The battle is also known as the '''Battle of Roberts Ridge''', after the first casualty of the battle, [[Navy SEAL]] Neil C. Roberts.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn the evening of 3 March 2002, the Task Force 11 leadership essentially ordered the Delta Force AFO commander to pass control of the [[Advanced Force Operations|AFO]] teams involved in the Operation Anaconda to the SEALs of Task Force Blue-who were moving teams in from Bagram to [[Gardez]] for this purpose. The SEALs were not heavily involved in the Operation up to this point but the TF11 commander bluntly ordered their deployment as well as changing the immediate command in an ongoing operation, possibly so that the SEALs could gain combat experience.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.57</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nIn the late evening of March 3, two SEAL teams from [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]], MAKO 30 & MAKO 21, were to arrive in Gardez for immediate insertion into the Shahi-Kot Valley. MAKO 21 planned to link up with AFO team Juliet at the northern end of the valley, resupply it and then establish a hide site/observation post on the eastern ridge above Task Force Rakkasan's blocking position; whilst  MAKO 30 planned to establish an observation point on the peak of [[Takur Ghar]], which commanded a view of the Shahi-Kot valley. Due to time constraints, a helicopter insertion would be needed for the team to reach the peak before dawn. The AFO suggested insertion at a point 1,400&nbsp;meters (4,300&nbsp;ft) east of the peak, but due to a delayed B-52 bomber sortie in the area, the team was told to turn back and land at the airstrip near Gardez. Further complications arose during the second lift off as they were delayed due to an air assault in proximity of the LZ. With the threat of daylight getting near, the SEALs chose the peak itself as the insertion point.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.58</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Roberts Ridge: A Story of Courage and Sacrifice on Takur Ghar Mountain, Afghanistan|last = MacPherson|first = Malcolm|publisher = Dell|date = July 25, 2006|isbn = 978-0553586800|location = New York|pages = [https://archive.org/details/robertsridgestor0000macp/page/4 4\u201312]|url = https://archive.org/details/robertsridgestor0000macp/page/4}}</ref>\n\nThe two teams were picked up by two [[CH-47 Chinook#MH-47E|MH-47 Chinook]] helicopters of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]], Razor 03 and Razor 04, at 11:23 PM on March 3. However, Razor 03 experienced engine difficulties, and two new MH-47s were dispatched to replace the original helicopters. This delay meant that the SEALs could not be inserted into the landing zone east of the peak until 2:30 AM on March 4, with not enough time to reach the peak before daylight.\n\nAn [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130H Spectre]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Nail 22, flew a reconnaissance mission over the peak prior to the landing and saw no enemy activity, but it was called away to support other troops before Razor 03 and 04 arrived at the landing zone; MAKO 30 team leader was uneasy at the speed with which the sweep was conducted and wondered whether they had the right mountain but he dismissed his doubts and trusted the Spectre's technology.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> At around 0245 hours, as Razor 03 flared to land at the LZ and was immediately fired upon by machinegun and RPGs, an RPG struck just behind the cockpit, starting a fire in the cabin. As machinegun rounds penetrated the unarmored Chinook, another [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], seconds after the first, hit the Chinooks right-side radar pod, which blew out all electrical power to the helicopter, particularly its miniguns and navigational systems. The Chinook was hit by a further 2 RPGs and more heavy automatic weapons fire from at least three distinct firing points (particularly from a supposedly abandoned DShK position). The Chinook set down at a slight depression, shielding the pilots from the DShK's fire. The pilot made the call to take the stricken helicopter off; as he brought the Chinook back into the air, PO1 Neil C. Roberts fell out of the open ramp. One SOAR crewman grabbed hold of his pack but lost his grip. Razor 03 attempted to return and retrieve him, but the damage prevented proper control and the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing in the valley<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.58-64</ref> about 11&nbsp;kilometers (7&nbsp;mi) away. Roberts fell 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) into the snow covering Takur Ghar and activated his infrared strobe to mark his position.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.59-64</ref> Razor 04 returned to the peak to attempt to rescue Roberts, as the Chinook offloaded MAKO 30, they came under immediate fire from the DShK, though it was relatively unscathed and left the AO after MAKO 30 successfully disembarked. At first, the insurgents didn't spot MAKO 30 in the early morning darkness, MAKO 30 split up into two-man pairs to conduct [[bounding overwatch|bounding movements]], making good ground until the enemy spotted them. One team ran across a concealed al-Qaeda bunker and killed 3 fighters before the SEALs were suppressed by other fighters with PKM machine gun. The firefight lasted 20 minutes before the team leader decided to order his team to break contact,<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.64</ref> USAF [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|combat controller]] Master Sergeant [[John A. Chapman]] (then Technical Sergeant) and two SEALs were wounded. Mako 30 was forced off the peak due to its losses and requested the assistance of the quick-reaction force mainly made up of Rangers from the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st Battalion]] [[75th Ranger Regiment|Ranger]] located at [[Bagram Air Base]], led by Captain [[Nate Self]]. Master Sergeant Chapman was mistakenly believed to have been killed prior to Mako 30 withdrawing from the peak. Alone and wounded, facing superior numbers of enemy insurgents, drone footage showed Sergeant Chapman killing at least two of the insurgents, one in hand-to-hand combat, before being killed himself.\n\nThe [[quick reaction force]] (QRF) consisted of 19 Rangers, a [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP), and a three-man USAF [[Air Force Special Tactics|special tactics team]] ([[Pararescue|PJs]] and [[Combat Controllers]]) carried by two Chinooks, Razor 01 and Razor 02. Due to satellite communications difficulties,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Progress toward forecasting of space weather effects on UHF SATCOM after Operation Anaconda|first1=Michael A.|last1=Kelly|first2=Joseph M.|last2=Comberiate|first3=Ethan S.|last3=Miller|first4=Larry J.|last4=Paxton|date=1 October 2014|journal=Space Weather|volume=12|issue=10|pages=2014SW001081|doi=10.1002/2014SW001081}}</ref><ref>\"[http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/SpaceBubblesmayhaveaidedenemyinfatalAfghanbattle 'Space Bubbles' may have aided enemy in fatal Afghan battle]\" ''[[American Geophysical Union]]'', 25 September 2014. Accessed: 2 October 2014.</ref> Razor 01 was mistakenly directed to the \"hot\" LZ on the peak at {{Coord|33|20|34|N|69|12|49|E|type:mountain_region:AF}}. As Air Force rules prohibited AC-130 aircraft from remaining in hostile airspace in daylight after the crash of an AC-130 during the [[Battle of Khafji]] in the [[Gulf War]], the AC-130 support protecting Mako 30 was forced to leave before Razor 01 reached the LZ. During the flight, the Ranger commander was informed that his team was to land and extract a \"SEAL sniper team\" that was in contact with the enemy, which was false.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.65</ref> Further communications difficulties meant that the pilot of the AC-130 was unaware that Razor 01 was incoming. At approximately 0610 hours, Razor 01, under the command of Captain Nate Self, reached the landing zone. The aircraft immediately began taking fire from RPG, DShK and small arms fire, and the right door [[minigun]]ner, Sergeant Philip Svitak, was killed by the small arms fire. An RPG then hit the helicopter, destroying the right engine and forcing it to crash land. As the Rangers and special tactics team exited the aircraft, Private First Class Matt Commons, posthumously promoted to Corporal, Sergeant Brad Crose, and Specialist Marc Anderson were killed. The surviving crew and quick-reaction force took cover in a hillock and a fierce firefight began. CPT Self decided to suppress the enemy firing points and launch a counterattack against the peak, bounding forward in subteams (one team firing while the other moved forward). They advanced about 20m before the weight of enemy fire forced them into cover.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nRazor 02, which had been diverted to Gardez as Razor 01 was landing on Takur Ghar, returned with the rest of the quick-reaction force at 0625 hours. Razor 02 inserted the other half of the QRF with its force of 10 Rangers at an \"offset\" landing zone, down the mountain some 800&nbsp;meters (2,600&nbsp;ft)  east and over 610&nbsp;meters (2,000&nbsp;ft) below the mountaintop.  The Rangers' movement up the hill was a physically demanding 2-hour effort under heavy mortar fire and in thin mountain air. They climbed the 45-70 degree slope, most of it covered in a meter (3&nbsp;ft) of snow, weighted down by their weapons, body armor and equipment. By 1030 am local time, the men covered half of the 50m distance to the enemy positions when they were engaged by PKM fire. They were exhausted and the enemy at the top of the hill a mere 50&nbsp;meters (160&nbsp;ft) from their position. Meanwhile, the Rangers on the peak called in several Danger Close gun runs from orbiting F-15E and F-16C aircraft to suppress the enemy before again attempting another ground assault. However the Ranger commander realized that what they had assumed was fallen logs foliage was actually a fortified bunker. He ordered his Rangers to withdraw as they did not have enough men to start clearing them and other prepared positions. The attached USAF CCT vectored in airstrikes to keep the al-Qaeda forces at bay until the rest of the Rangers arrived; the CCT directed a number of strikes on the peak, which were well within the normal safety limits and he also called in a strike from a MQ-1 Predator UAV (which was the first recorded use of the vehicle), one of the two hellfire missiles it fired collapsed the bunker. As the ten men of Razor 02 arrived, the Rangers prepared to assault the enemy positions.  As the Air Force CCT called in a last airstrike on the enemy bunkers and with two machine guns providing suppression fire, seven Rangers stormed the hill as quickly as they could in the knee-deep snow - shooting and throwing grenades. Within minutes, the Rangers took the hill, killing several al Qaeda fighters.\n\nThe force was able to consolidate its position on the peak. An enemy counterattack midday mortally wounded Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham, a pararescueman.  The wounded were refused [[medical evacuation]] during the daylight hours, due to risk of another downed helicopter. However, [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|Australian SASR]] soldiers, along with U.S. Air Force Combat Controller Jim Hotaling, had infiltrated nearby prior to the first helicopter crash as part of a long range reconnaissance mission. They remained undetected in an [[observation post]] through the firefight and CCT Jim Hotaling proved critical in co-ordinating multiple Coalition air strikes to prevent the al Qaeda fighters from overrunning the downed aircraft. This, plus the actions of the two SASR operators working with the 10th Mountain, earned the commander of the Australian SASR force in Afghanistan the U.S. Bronze Star for his unit's outstanding contribution to the war on terrorism.\n\nAt around 20:00 hours, the quick-reaction force and Mako 30/21 were exfiltrated from the Takur Ghar peak. \n\nFor actions on Takur Ghar, both Master Sergeant Chapman and Senior Airman Cunningham were awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], the second highest award for bravery. Master Sergeant Chapman was, in 2018, posthumously awarded the highest and most prestigious personal military decoration in the USA, the [[Medal of Honor]]. <ref>[[John A.

For the U.S. side, the battle proved the deadliest entanglement of [[Operation Anaconda]], an effort early in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] to rout al-Qaeda forces from the [[Shahi-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]]. The battle saw three helicopter landings by the U.S. on the mountain top, each greeted by direct assault from al-Qaeda forces. Although Takur Ghar was eventually taken, seven U.S. service members were killed and many wounded. The battle is also known as the '''Battle of Roberts Ridge''', after the first casualty of the battle, [[Navy SEAL]] Neil C. Roberts.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn the evening of 3 March 2002, the Task Force 11 leadership essentially ordered the Delta Force AFO commander to pass control of the [[Advanced Force Operations|AFO]] teams involved in the Operation Anaconda to the SEALs of Task Force Blue-who were moving teams in from Bagram to [[Gardez]] for this purpose. The SEALs were not heavily involved in the Operation up to this point but the TF11 commander bluntly ordered their deployment as well as changing the immediate command in an ongoing operation, possibly so that the SEALs could gain combat experience.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.57</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nIn the late evening of March 3, two SEAL teams from [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]], MAKO 30 & MAKO 21, were to arrive in Gardez for immediate insertion into the Shahi-Kot Valley. MAKO 21 planned to link up with AFO team Juliet at the northern end of the valley, resupply it and then establish a hide site/observation post on the eastern ridge above Task Force Rakkasan's blocking position; whilst  MAKO 30 planned to establish an observation point on the peak of [[Takur Ghar]], which commanded a view of the Shahi-Kot valley. Due to time constraints, a helicopter insertion would be needed for the team to reach the peak before dawn. The AFO suggested insertion at a point 1,400&nbsp;meters (4,300&nbsp;ft) east of the peak, but due to a delayed B-52 bomber sortie in the area, the team was told to turn back and land at the airstrip near Gardez. Further complications arose during the second lift off as they were delayed due to an air assault in proximity of the LZ. With the threat of daylight getting near, the SEALs chose the peak itself as the insertion point.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.58</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Roberts Ridge: A Story of Courage and Sacrifice on Takur Ghar Mountain, Afghanistan|last = MacPherson|first = Malcolm|publisher = Dell|date = July 25, 2006|isbn = 978-0553586800|location = New York|pages = [https://archive.org/details/robertsridgestor0000macp/page/4 4\u201312]|url = https://archive.org/details/robertsridgestor0000macp/page/4}}</ref>\n\nThe two teams were picked up by two [[CH-47 Chinook#MH-47E|MH-47 Chinook]] helicopters of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]], Razor 03 and Razor 04, at 11:23 PM on March 3. However, Razor 03 experienced engine difficulties, and two new MH-47s were dispatched to replace the original helicopters. This delay meant that the SEALs could not be inserted into the landing zone east of the peak until 2:30 AM on March 4, with not enough time to reach the peak before daylight.\n\nAn [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130H Spectre]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Nail 22, flew a reconnaissance mission over the peak prior to the landing and saw no enemy activity, but it was called away to support other troops before Razor 03 and 04 arrived at the landing zone; MAKO 30 team leader was uneasy at the speed with which the sweep was conducted and wondered whether they had the right mountain but he dismissed his doubts and trusted the Spectre's technology.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> At around 0245 hours, as Razor 03 flared to land at the LZ and was immediately fired upon by machinegun and RPGs, an RPG struck just behind the cockpit, starting a fire in the cabin. As machinegun rounds penetrated the unarmored Chinook, another [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], seconds after the first, hit the Chinooks right-side radar pod, which blew out all electrical power to the helicopter, particularly its miniguns and navigational systems. The Chinook was hit by a further 2 RPGs and more heavy automatic weapons fire from at least three distinct firing points (particularly from a supposedly abandoned DShK position). The Chinook set down at a slight depression, shielding the pilots from the DShK's fire. The pilot made the call to take the stricken helicopter off; as he brought the Chinook back into the air, PO1 Neil C. Roberts fell out of the open ramp. One SOAR crewman grabbed hold of his pack but lost his grip. Razor 03 attempted to return and retrieve him, but the damage prevented proper control and the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing in the valley<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.58-64</ref> about 11&nbsp;kilometers (7&nbsp;mi) away. Roberts fell 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) into the snow covering Takur Ghar and activated his infrared strobe to mark his position.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.59-64</ref> Razor 04 returned to the peak to attempt to rescue Roberts, as the Chinook offloaded MAKO 30, they came under immediate fire from the DShK, though it was relatively unscathed and left the AO after MAKO 30 successfully disembarked. At first, the insurgents didn't spot MAKO 30 in the early morning darkness, MAKO 30 split up into two-man pairs to conduct [[bounding overwatch|bounding movements]], making good ground until the enemy spotted them. One team ran across a concealed al-Qaeda bunker and killed 3 fighters before the SEALs were suppressed by other fighters with PKM machine gun. The firefight lasted 20 minutes before the team leader decided to order his team to break contact,<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.64</ref> USAF [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|combat controller]] Master Sergeant [[John A. Chapman]] (then Technical Sergeant) and two SEALs were wounded. Mako 30 was forced off the peak due to its losses and requested the assistance of the quick-reaction force mainly made up of Rangers from the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st Battalion]] [[75th Ranger Regiment|Ranger]] located at [[Bagram Air Base]], led by Captain [[Nate Self]]. Master Sergeant Chapman was mistakenly believed to have been killed prior to Mako 30 withdrawing from the peak. Alone and wounded, facing superior numbers of enemy insurgents, drone footage showed Sergeant Chapman killing at least two of the insurgents, one in hand-to-hand combat, before being killed himself.\n\nThe [[quick reaction force]] (QRF) consisted of 19 Rangers, a [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP), and a three-man USAF [[Air Force Special Tactics|special tactics team]] ([[Pararescue|PJs]] and [[Combat Controllers]]) carried by two Chinooks, Razor 01 and Razor 02.

As Air Force rules prohibited AC-130 aircraft from remaining in hostile airspace in daylight after the crash of an AC-130 during the [[Battle of Khafji]] in the [[Gulf War]], the AC-130 support protecting Mako 30 was forced to leave before Razor 01 reached the LZ. During the flight, the Ranger commander was informed that his team was to land and extract a \"SEAL sniper team\" that was in contact with the enemy, which was false.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.65</ref> Further communications difficulties meant that the pilot of the AC-130 was unaware that Razor 01 was incoming. At approximately 0610 hours, Razor 01, under the command of Captain Nate Self, reached the landing zone. The aircraft immediately began taking fire from RPG, DShK and small arms fire, and the right door [[minigun]]ner, Sergeant Philip Svitak, was killed by the small arms fire. An RPG then hit the helicopter, destroying the right engine and forcing it to crash land. As the Rangers and special tactics team exited the aircraft, Private First Class Matt Commons, posthumously promoted to Corporal, Sergeant Brad Crose, and Specialist Marc Anderson were killed. The surviving crew and quick-reaction force took cover in a hillock and a fierce firefight began. CPT Self decided to suppress the enemy firing points and launch a counterattack against the peak, bounding forward in subteams (one team firing while the other moved forward). They advanced about 20m before the weight of enemy fire forced them into cover.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nRazor 02, which had been diverted to Gardez as Razor 01 was landing on Takur Ghar, returned with the rest of the quick-reaction force at 0625 hours. Razor 02 inserted the other half of the QRF with its force of 10 Rangers at an \"offset\" landing zone, down the mountain some 800&nbsp;meters (2,600&nbsp;ft)  east and over 610&nbsp;meters (2,000&nbsp;ft) below the mountaintop.  The Rangers' movement up the hill was a physically demanding 2-hour effort under heavy mortar fire and in thin mountain air. They climbed the 45-70 degree slope, most of it covered in a meter (3&nbsp;ft) of snow, weighted down by their weapons, body armor and equipment. By 1030 am local time, the men covered half of the 50m distance to the enemy positions when they were engaged by PKM fire. They were exhausted and the enemy at the top of the hill a mere 50&nbsp;meters (160&nbsp;ft) from their position. Meanwhile, the Rangers on the peak called in several Danger Close gun runs from orbiting F-15E and F-16C aircraft to suppress the enemy before again attempting another ground assault. However the Ranger commander realized that what they had assumed was fallen logs foliage was actually a fortified bunker. He ordered his Rangers to withdraw as they did not have enough men to start clearing them and other prepared positions. The attached USAF CCT vectored in airstrikes to keep the al-Qaeda forces at bay until the rest of the Rangers arrived; the CCT directed a number of strikes on the peak, which were well within the normal safety limits and he also called in a strike from a MQ-1 Predator UAV (which was the first recorded use of the vehicle), one of the two hellfire missiles it fired collapsed the bunker. As the ten men of Razor 02 arrived, the Rangers prepared to assault the enemy positions.  As the Air Force CCT called in a last airstrike on the enemy bunkers and with two machine guns providing suppression fire, seven Rangers stormed the hill as quickly as they could in the knee-deep snow - shooting and throwing grenades. Within minutes, the Rangers took the hill, killing several al Qaeda fighters.\n\nThe force was able to consolidate its position on the peak. An enemy counterattack midday mortally wounded Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham, a pararescueman.  The wounded were refused [[medical evacuation]] during the daylight hours, due to risk of another downed helicopter. However, [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|Australian SASR]] soldiers, along with U.S. Air Force Combat Controller Jim Hotaling, had infiltrated nearby prior to the first helicopter crash as part of a long range reconnaissance mission. They remained undetected in an [[observation post]] through the firefight and CCT Jim Hotaling proved critical in co-ordinating multiple Coalition air strikes to prevent the al Qaeda fighters from overrunning the downed aircraft. This, plus the actions of the two SASR operators working with the 10th Mountain, earned the commander of the Australian SASR force in Afghanistan the U.S. Bronze Star for his unit's outstanding contribution to the war on terrorism.\n\nAt around 20:00 hours, the quick-reaction force and Mako 30/21 were exfiltrated from the Takur Ghar peak. \n\nFor actions on Takur Ghar, both Master Sergeant Chapman and Senior Airman Cunningham were awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], the second highest award for bravery.

In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State included [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. They assembled at the courthouse on Market Street and ratified the [[United States Constitution]], and New York State entered the new union as the eleventh of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] to become the United States. In 1799, a new seal was created for the city.\n\nPoughkeepsie was a major center for whale rendering, and the industry flourished during the 19th century through shipping, millineries, paper mills, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including some owned by [[Matthew Vassar]], founder of [[Vassar College]]. Families built palatial weekend homes nearby, such as the [[Astor family|Astors]], Rogers, and [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], due to the area's natural beauty and proximity to New York City. The [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site|Vanderbilt Mansion]] is located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie in the town of [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] and is registered as a national historic site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century. The city is home to the [[Bardavon 1869 Opera House]], the oldest continuously operating entertainment venue in the state.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Poughkeepsie is located on the western edge of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], in [[Downstate New York]]'s [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley Area]].\n\nIt is bordered by the town of [[Lloyd, New York|Lloyd]] across the [[Hudson River]] to the west and by the [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]] on the north, east and south.

The [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site|Vanderbilt Mansion]] is located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie in the town of [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] and is registered as a national historic site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century.

Poughkeepsie is the northern terminus of Metro-North's [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]. [[Amtrak]] also serves the station, along the Hudson River south to New York City's [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] and north along the river to [[Albany\u2013Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer]] station and points further north and west. Amtrak trains serving Poughkeepsie are the ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'', ''[[Empire Service (train)|Empire Service]]'', ''[[Ethan Allen Express]]'', ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]'', and ''[[Lake Shore Limited]].''\n\nThe [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]], opened in 1930, carries US 44 and NY 55 across the Hudson River from Poughkeepsie to [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]]. The [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] opened in 1888 to carry railroad traffic across the Hudson, but all usage of the bridge came to an end when a 1974 fire damaged its decking. A local group (Walkway over the Hudson) raised the funds to convert the bridge into a unique linear park connecting rail trails on both sides of the Hudson River. The Walkway Over The Hudson opened on October 3, 2009, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s first exploration of the river named for him.<ref>[http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/pbpj743.Html Poughkeepsie Bridge - 'The bridge was Moving'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128224227/http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/pbpj743.Html |date=November 28, 2005 }}.

The nearest major airport to Poughkeepsie is [[Stewart International Airport]] about {{convert|25|mi}} south in [[Newburgh (town), New York|Newburgh]]. Other nearby airports include [[Westchester County Airport]] approximately 58.1 miles (93&nbsp;km) south, [[Albany International Airport]] approximately {{convert|85|mi}} north and the three major metropolitan airports for New York City: [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] approximately {{convert|88|mi}} south, [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] approximately {{convert|88|mi}} south, and [[LaGuardia Airport]] approximately {{convert|80|mi}} south.\n\nBus transit service is provided by [[Dutchess County Public Transit]], operated by Dutchess County, which travels throughout Dutchess County and also serves as the main link to the Route 9 corridor including [[Poughkeepsie Galleria]] and [[South Hills Mall]].\n\nBoth services have a quasi-hub at the intersection of Main and Market streets, adjacent to the Mid-Hudson Civic Center and at the west end of the former pedestrian-only [[Main Mall]] (the mall was removed in 2001, with those blocks being restored back to traffic and to the name Main Street). Other buses serving this area include [[Trailways of New York|Adirondack Trailways]], [[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line]], commuter runs to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], and a shuttle to [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]].\n\n*\n\n==Culture==\n===Sports===\nThe [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team is a member of the [[New York\u2013Penn League]], and play at [[Dutchess Stadium]] in the nearby town of [[Fishkill (town), New York|Fishkill]].\n\nThe Hudson Valley Hawks were a team in the [[National Professional Basketball League (2007\u201308)|National Professional Basketball League]] until 2009 when the league disbanded. The team's home court was at [[Beacon City Schools|Beacon High School]], located approximately 16 miles south in the city of [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]].\n\nThe Hudson Valley Highlanders of the North American Football League played their home games at [[Dietz Stadium]] in nearby [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]].\n\nPoughkeepsie hosted a founding member of the [[North Eastern Hockey League]] with the formation of the [[Connecticut Cougars|Poughkeepsie Panthers]] in 2003. However, due to financial problems, the team only played for one season, and became the Connecticut Cougars the following year. The league folded due financial problems in January 2008. Subsequently, the city was home to the [[Hudson Valley Bears]], one of four founding members of the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (2008\u201309)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]], for one season. Both teams played their home games at the McCann Ice Arena in the [[Mid-Hudson Civic Center]].\n\n[[File:1907 Poughkeepsie Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1907 [[Poughkeepsie Regatta]]]]\nOne of Poughkeepsie's most notable sports events was the annual [[Poughkeepsie Regatta]] of the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which was held on the [[Hudson River]] from 1895 to 1949. The top college teams would attend along with tens of thousands of spectators. Poughkeepsie was known as the rowing capital of the world. Spectators watched from the hills and bluffs overlooking the river and from chartered boats and trains that followed the races along the entire length of the course; which were longer than present-day races, with varsity eights rowing a {{Convert|4|mi|adj=on}} race. When the rowing association moved the regatta to other venues, the Mid-Hudson Rowing Association was formed to preserve rowing in the area. It successfully lobbied to preserve the regatta's facilities for use by area high schools and club rowing programs.

This publication was essential to the development of the [[classical electromagnetism|theory of electromagnetism]].<ref name=\"1785a\"/> He used a [[torsion balance]] to study the repulsion and attraction forces of [[charged particle]]s, and determined that the magnitude of the electric force between two [[point charge]]s is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nThe torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak [[torsion spring]]. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] rod with a [[metal]]-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a [[silk]] thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of [[static electricity]], and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the [[scientific instrument|instrument]]. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== The law ==\n\nCoulomb's law states that:\n\n{{quote|The magnitude of the electrostatic [[force]] of attraction or repulsion between two point [[electric charge|charges]] is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.<ref name=\"1785a\">Coulomb (1785a) [https://books.google.com/books?id=by5EAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA569#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Premier m\u00e9moire sur l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et le magn\u00e9tisme,\"] ''Histoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'', pp. 569\u2013577 \u2014 Coulomb studied the repulsive force between bodies having electrical charges of the same sign:\n{{quote|''Il r\u00e9sulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action r\u00e9pulsive que les deux balles \u00e9lectrif\u00e9es de la m\u00eame nature d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison inverse du carr\u00e9 des distances.''\n\nTranslation: It follows therefore from these three tests, that the repulsive force that the two balls \u2014 [that were] electrified with the same kind of electricity \u2014 exert on each other, follows the inverse proportion of the square of the distance.|author=Coulomb (1785b) [https://books.google.com/books?id=by5EAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA578#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Second m\u00e9moire sur l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et le magn\u00e9tisme,\"] ''Histoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'', pages 578\u2013611}} Coulomb also showed that oppositely charged bodies obey an inverse-square law of attraction.</ref>\n\nThe force is along the straight line joining them.

Coulomb's constant is given by {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|4\u03c0''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}}}}. The constant {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}} is the [[vacuum permittivity|vacuum electric permittivity]] (also known as \"electric constant\") <ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 15</ref> in C<sup>2</sup>\u22c5m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5N<sup>\u22121</sup>. It should not be confused with {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|''r''}}}}, which is the dimensionless [[relative permittivity]] of the material in which the charges are immersed, or with their product {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|''a''}} {{=}} ''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}''\u03b5''{{sub|''r''}} }}, which is called \"[[absolute permittivity]] of the material\" and is still used in [[electrical engineering]].\n\nThe [[SI derived units]] for the electric field are [[volt]]s per meter, newtons per coulomb, or [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] meters per second.\n\nCoulomb's law and [[Coulomb's constant]] can also be interpreted in various terms:\n* [[Atomic units]]. In atomic units the force is expressed in [[hartree]]s per [[Bohr radius]], the charge in terms of the [[elementary charge]], and the distances in terms of the ''Bohr radius''.\n* [[Electrostatic units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. In electrostatic units and Gaussian units, the unit charge (''esu'' or [[statcoulomb]]) is defined in such a way that the Coulomb constant {{math|''k''}} disappears because it has the value of one and becomes [[dimensionless]].\n* [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (also called ''rationalized'').

In the simplest case, the field is considered to be generated solely by a single source [[point charge]]. The strength and direction of the Coulomb force {{math|'''F'''}} on a test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} depends on the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} that it finds itself in, such that {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''q''{{sub|t}}'''E'''}}. If the field is generated by a positive source point charge {{math|''q''}}, the direction of the electric field points along lines directed radially outwards from it, i.e. in the direction that a positive point test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} would move if placed in the field. For a negative point source charge, the direction is radially inwards.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} can be derived from [[Coulomb's law#The law|Coulomb's law]]. By choosing one of the point charges to be the source, and the other to be the test charge, it follows from Coulomb's law that the magnitude of the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} created by a single source [[point charge]] {{math|''q''}} at a certain distance from it {{math|''r''}} in vacuum is given by:\n\n:<math>|\\boldsymbol{E}|={1\\over4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}{|q|\\over r^2}</math>\n\n=== Coulomb's constant ===\n{{main|Coulomb's constant}}\n\nCoulomb's constant is a proportionality factor that appears in Coulomb's law as well as in other electric-related formulas.

When movement takes place, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] must be taken into consideration, and a result, an extra factor is introduced, which alters the force produced on the two objects. This extra part of the force is called the [[magnetic]] force, and is described by [[magnetic field]]s. For slow movement, the magnetic force is minimal and Coulomb's law can still be considered approximately correct, but when the charges are moving more quickly in relation to each other, the full [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] rules (incorporating the magnetic force) must be considered.\n\n=== Quantum field theory origin ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Feynman diagram - Moller scattering 1.svg|thumb|The most basic Feynman diagram for QED interaction between two fermions]]\nIn simple terms, the [[Coulomb potential]] derives from the [[Quantum Electrodynamics|QED]] Lagrangian as follows. The [[Lagrangian (field theory)#Quantum electrodynamic Lagrangian|Lagrangian]] of quantum electrodynamics is normally written in [[natural units]], but in SI units, it is:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{QED} = \\bar{\\psi} ( i\\hbar c \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m c^2) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4 \\hbar c}F_{\\mu \\nu} F^{\\mu \\nu}</math>\n\nwhere the covariant derivative (in SI units) is:\n\n:<math>{D}_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + \\frac{i g}{\\hbar c} A_\\mu</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is the [[coupling constant#gauge coupling|gauge coupling parameter]]. By putting the covariant derivative into the lagrangian explicitly, the interaction term (the term involving both <math>A</math> and <math>\\psi</math>) is seen to be:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{int} = i g \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu A_\\mu \\psi</math>\n\nThe most basic [[Feynman diagram]] for a QED interaction between two [[fermion]]s is the exchange of a single photon, with no loops. Following the [[Feynman rules]], this therefore contributes two QED vertex factors (<math>i g Q \\gamma_\\mu</math>) to the potential, where Q is the QED-[[Charge (physics)#abstract definition|charge operator]] (Q gives the charge in terms of the electron charge, and hence is exactly \u22121 for electrons, etc.). For the photon in the diagram, the Feynman rules demand the contribution of one bosonic massless [[propagator]] <math>\\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{k^2}\\right)</math>. Ignoring the momentum on the external legs (the fermions), the potential is therefore:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int e^{\\frac {i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}}{\\hbar}}\n(i Q_1 g^2 \\gamma_\\mu)(i Q_2 g^2 \\gamma_\\nu) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{k^2}\\right) \\;d^3k</math>\n\nwhich can be more usefully written as\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- g^2 \\hbar c Q_1 Q_2}{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int e^{\\frac {i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}}{\\hbar}} \\frac {4\\pi \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} }{k^2} \\;d^3k</math>\n\nwhere <math>Q_i</math> is the QED-charge on the ''i''th particle. Recognising the integral as just being a [[Fourier transform]] enables the equation to be simplified:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- g^2 \\hbar c Q_1 Q_2 }{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{r}.</math>\n\nFor various reasons, it is more convenient to define the [[fine-structure constant]] <math>\\alpha = \\frac{g^2}{4 \\pi}</math>, and then define <math>e = \\sqrt{4 \\pi \\alpha \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar c }</math>. Rearranging these definitions gives:\n\n:<math>g^2 \\hbar c = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0}</math>\n\nIn natural units (<math>\\hbar = 1</math>, <math>c = 1</math>, and <math>\\varepsilon_0 = 1</math>), <math>g = e</math>. Continuing in SI units, the potential is therefore\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- e^2 }{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r}</math>\n\nDefining <math>q_i = e Q_i</math>, as the macroscopic 'electric charge', makes e the macroscopic 'electric charge' for an electron, and enables the formula to be put into the familiar form of the Coulomb potential:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{-1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}</math>\n\nThe force (<math>\\frac{dV(\\mathbf{r})}{dr}</math>) is therefore :\n\n:<math>F(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}</math>\n\nThe derivation makes clear that the force law is only an approximation \u2014 it ignores the momentum of the input and output fermion lines, and ignores all quantum corrections (i.e. the myriad possible diagrams with internal loops).\n\nThe Coulomb potential, and its derivation, can be seen as a special case of the [[Yukawa potential]] (specifically, the case where the exchanged boson \u2013 the photon \u2013 has no rest mass).\n\n== Scalar form ==\n[[Image:CoulombsLaw.svg|thumb|right|The absolute value of the force {{math|'''F'''}} between two [[point charge]]s {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''Q''}} relates to the distance between the point charges and to the simple product of their charges.

Consider two small spheres of mass {{math|''m''}} and same-sign charge {{math|''q''}}, hanging from two ropes of negligible mass of length {{math|''l''}}. The forces acting on each sphere are three: the weight {{math|''mg''}}, the rope tension {{math|''T''}} and the electric force {{math|''F''}}.\n\nIn the equilibrium state:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>T \\ \\sin \\theta_1 =F_1 \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nand:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>T \\ \\cos \\theta_1 =mg \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nDividing ({{EquationNote|1}}) by ({{EquationNote|2}}):\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac {\\sin \\theta_1}{\\cos \\theta_1 }=\n\\frac {F_1}{mg}\\Rightarrow F_1= mg \\tan \\theta_1 </math>\n|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nLet {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} be the distance between the charged spheres; the repulsion force between them {{math|''F''{{sub|1}}}}, assuming Coulomb's law is correct, is equal to\n\n{{NumBlk||\n: <math> F_1 = \\frac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Coulomb's law}}}}\n\nso:\n{{NumBlk||\n: <math>\\frac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2}=mg \\tan \\theta_1 \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nIf we now discharge one of the spheres, and we put it in contact with the charged sphere, each one of them acquires a charge {{math|{{sfrac|''q''|2}}}}. In the equilibrium state, the distance between the charges will be {{math|''L''{{sub|2}} < ''L''{{sub|1}}}} and the repulsion force between them will be:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>F_2 = \\frac{{(\\frac{q}{2})}^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}=\\frac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2} \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nWe know that {{math|''F''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''mg'' tan ''\u03b8''{{sub|2}}}}. And:\n:<math>\\frac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}=mg \\tan \\theta_2</math>\n\nDividing ({{EquationNote|4}}) by ({{EquationNote|5}}), we get: \n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac{\\left( \\cfrac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2} \\right)}{\\left(\\cfrac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}\\right)} = \\frac{mg \\tan \\theta_1}{mg \\tan \\theta_2} \\Rightarrow 4 {\\left( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 =  \\frac{ \\tan \\theta_1}{ \\tan \\theta_2}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nMeasuring the angles {{math|''\u03b8''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''\u03b8''{{sub|2}}}} and the distance between the charges {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''L''{{sub|2}}}} is sufficient to verify that the equality is true taking into account the experimental error. In practice, angles can be difficult to measure, so if the length of the ropes is sufficiently great, the angles will be small enough to make the following approximation:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\tan \\theta \\approx \\sin \\theta= \\frac{\\frac{L}{2}}{\\ell}=\\frac{L}{2\\ell} \\Rightarrow \\frac{ \\tan \\theta_1}{ \\tan \\theta_2} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{L_1}{2\\ell}}{\\frac{L_2}{2\\ell}}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nUsing this approximation, the relationship ({{EquationNote|6}}) becomes the much simpler expression:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac{\\frac{L_1}{2\\ell}}{\\frac{L_2}{2\\ell}}\\approx 4 {\\left ( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 \\Rightarrow \\,\\!</math> <math>\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\approx 4 {\\left ( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\approx\\sqrt[3]{4} \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nIn this way, the verification is limited to measuring the distance between the charges and check that the division approximates the theoretical value.\n\n== Atomic forces ==\n{{see also|Coulomb explosion}}\nCoulomb's law holds even within [[atom]]s, correctly describing the [[force]] between the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]] and each of the negatively charged [[electron]]s. This simple law also correctly accounts for the forces that bind atoms together to form [[molecule]]s and for the forces that bind atoms and molecules together to form solids and liquids. Generally, as the distance between [[ion]]s increases, the force of attraction, and binding energy, approach zero and [[ionic bonding]] is less favorable. As the magnitude of opposing charges increases, energy increases and ionic bonding is more favorable.\n\n== Relation to Gauss's law ==\n=== Deriving Gauss's law from Coulomb's law ===\n\nStrictly speaking, [[Gauss's law]] cannot be derived from Coulomb's law alone, since Coulomb's law gives the electric field due to an individual [[point charge]] only. However, Gauss's law ''can'' be proven from Coulomb's law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field obeys the [[superposition principle]]. The superposition principle says that the resulting field is the vector sum of fields generated by each particle (or the integral, if the charges are distributed smoothly in space).\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Outline of proof\n|-\n|[[Coulomb's law]] states that the electric field due to a stationary [[point charge]] is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\mathbf{e}_r}{r^2}</math>\nwhere\n:{{math|'''e'''<sub>''r''</sub>}} is the radial [[unit vector]],\n:{{mvar|r}} is the radius, {{math|{{abs|'''r'''}}}},\n:{{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[electric constant]],\n:{{mvar|q}} is the charge of the particle, which is assumed to be located at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]].\n\nUsing the expression from Coulomb's law, we get the total field at {{math|'''r'''}} by using an integral to sum the field at {{math|'''r'''}} due to the infinitesimal charge at each other point {{math|'''s'''}} in space, to give\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{s})(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|^3} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{s}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the charge density. If we take the divergence of both sides of this equation with respect to '''r''', and use the known theorem<ref>See, for example, {{cite book | last=Griffiths | first=David J. | title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |edition=4th | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=2013 | page=50 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^3}\\right) = 4\\pi \\delta(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b4''('''r''')}} is the [[Dirac delta function]], the result is\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{s})\\, \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s})\\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{s}</math>\n\nUsing the \"[[Dirac delta function#Translation|sifting property]]\" of the Dirac delta function, we arrive at\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\varepsilon_0},</math>\n\nwhich is the differential form of Gauss' law, as desired.\n|}\n\nNote that since Coulomb's law only applies to stationary charges, there is no reason to expect Gauss's law to hold for moving charges based on this derivation alone. In fact, Gauss's law does hold for moving charges, and in this respect Gauss's law is more general than Coulomb's law.\n\n=== Deriving Coulomb's law from Gauss's law ===\nStrictly speaking, Coulomb's law cannot be derived from Gauss's law alone, since Gauss's law does not give any information regarding the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of {{math|'''E'''}} (see [[Helmholtz decomposition]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]). However, Coulomb's law ''can'' be proven from Gauss's law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field from a [[point charge]] is spherically symmetric (this assumption, like Coulomb's law itself, is exactly true if the charge is stationary, and approximately true if the charge is in motion).\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Outline of proof\n|-\n|Taking {{mvar|S}} in the integral form of Gauss' law to be a spherical surface of radius {{mvar|r}}, centered at the point charge {{mvar|Q}}, we have\n\n:<math>\\oint_S\\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} </math>\n\nBy the assumption of spherical symmetry, the integrand is a constant which can be taken out of the integral. The result is\n\n: <math>4\\pi r^2\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''r\u0302'''}} is a [[unit vector]] pointing radially away from the charge. Again by spherical symmetry, {{math|'''E'''}} points in the radial direction, and so we get\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}</math>\n\nwhich is essentially equivalent to Coulomb's law. Thus the [[inverse-square law]] dependence of the electric field in Coulomb's law follows from Gauss' law.\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Coulomb's law}}\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Biot\u2013Savart law]]\n* [[Darwin Lagrangian]]\n* [[Electromagnetic force]]\n* [[Gauss's law]]\n* [[Method of image charges]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which uses a similar structure, but for mass instead of charge\n* [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Huray |first1=Paul G. |title=Maxwell's equations |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ| isbn=0470542764 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jackson |first=J.

This publication was essential to the development of the [[classical electromagnetism|theory of electromagnetism]].<ref name=\"1785a\"/> He used a [[torsion balance]] to study the repulsion and attraction forces of [[charged particle]]s, and determined that the magnitude of the electric force between two [[point charge]]s is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nThe torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak [[torsion spring]]. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] rod with a [[metal]]-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a [[silk]] thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of [[static electricity]], and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the [[scientific instrument|instrument]]. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== The law ==\n\nCoulomb's law states that:\n\n{{quote|The magnitude of the electrostatic [[force]] of attraction or repulsion between two point [[electric charge|charges]] is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.<ref name=\"1785a\">Coulomb (1785a) [https://books.google.com/books?id=by5EAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA569#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Premier m\u00e9moire sur l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et le magn\u00e9tisme,\"] ''Histoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'', pp. 569\u2013577 \u2014 Coulomb studied the repulsive force between bodies having electrical charges of the same sign:\n{{quote|''Il r\u00e9sulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action r\u00e9pulsive que les deux balles \u00e9lectrif\u00e9es de la m\u00eame nature d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison inverse du carr\u00e9 des distances.''\n\nTranslation: It follows therefore from these three tests, that the repulsive force that the two balls \u2014 [that were] electrified with the same kind of electricity \u2014 exert on each other, follows the inverse proportion of the square of the distance.|author=Coulomb (1785b) [https://books.google.com/books?id=by5EAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA578#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Second m\u00e9moire sur l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et le magn\u00e9tisme,\"] ''Histoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences'', pages 578\u2013611}} Coulomb also showed that oppositely charged bodies obey an inverse-square law of attraction.</ref>\n\nThe force is along the straight line joining them.

Coulomb's constant is given by {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|4\u03c0''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}}}}. The constant {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}} is the [[vacuum permittivity|vacuum electric permittivity]] (also known as \"electric constant\") <ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 15</ref> in C<sup>2</sup>\u22c5m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5N<sup>\u22121</sup>. It should not be confused with {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|''r''}}}}, which is the dimensionless [[relative permittivity]] of the material in which the charges are immersed, or with their product {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|''a''}} {{=}} ''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}''\u03b5''{{sub|''r''}} }}, which is called \"[[absolute permittivity]] of the material\" and is still used in [[electrical engineering]].\n\nThe [[SI derived units]] for the electric field are [[volt]]s per meter, newtons per coulomb, or [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] meters per second.\n\nCoulomb's law and [[Coulomb's constant]] can also be interpreted in various terms:\n* [[Atomic units]]. In atomic units the force is expressed in [[hartree]]s per [[Bohr radius]], the charge in terms of the [[elementary charge]], and the distances in terms of the ''Bohr radius''.\n* [[Electrostatic units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. In electrostatic units and Gaussian units, the unit charge (''esu'' or [[statcoulomb]]) is defined in such a way that the Coulomb constant {{math|''k''}} disappears because it has the value of one and becomes [[dimensionless]].\n* [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (also called ''rationalized'').

In the simplest case, the field is considered to be generated solely by a single source [[point charge]]. The strength and direction of the Coulomb force {{math|'''F'''}} on a test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} depends on the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} that it finds itself in, such that {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''q''{{sub|t}}'''E'''}}. If the field is generated by a positive source point charge {{math|''q''}}, the direction of the electric field points along lines directed radially outwards from it, i.e. in the direction that a positive point test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} would move if placed in the field. For a negative point source charge, the direction is radially inwards.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} can be derived from [[Coulomb's law#The law|Coulomb's law]]. By choosing one of the point charges to be the source, and the other to be the test charge, it follows from Coulomb's law that the magnitude of the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} created by a single source [[point charge]] {{math|''q''}} at a certain distance from it {{math|''r''}} in vacuum is given by:\n\n:<math>|\\boldsymbol{E}|={1\\over4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}{|q|\\over r^2}</math>\n\n=== Coulomb's constant ===\n{{main|Coulomb's constant}}\n\nCoulomb's constant is a proportionality factor that appears in Coulomb's law as well as in other electric-related formulas.

When movement takes place, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] must be taken into consideration, and a result, an extra factor is introduced, which alters the force produced on the two objects. This extra part of the force is called the [[magnetic]] force, and is described by [[magnetic field]]s. For slow movement, the magnetic force is minimal and Coulomb's law can still be considered approximately correct, but when the charges are moving more quickly in relation to each other, the full [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] rules (incorporating the magnetic force) must be considered.\n\n=== Quantum field theory origin ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Feynman diagram - Moller scattering 1.svg|thumb|The most basic Feynman diagram for QED interaction between two fermions]]\nIn simple terms, the [[Coulomb potential]] derives from the [[Quantum Electrodynamics|QED]] Lagrangian as follows. The [[Lagrangian (field theory)#Quantum electrodynamic Lagrangian|Lagrangian]] of quantum electrodynamics is normally written in [[natural units]], but in SI units, it is:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{QED} = \\bar{\\psi} ( i\\hbar c \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m c^2) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4 \\hbar c}F_{\\mu \\nu} F^{\\mu \\nu}</math>\n\nwhere the covariant derivative (in SI units) is:\n\n:<math>{D}_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + \\frac{i g}{\\hbar c} A_\\mu</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is the [[coupling constant#gauge coupling|gauge coupling parameter]]. By putting the covariant derivative into the lagrangian explicitly, the interaction term (the term involving both <math>A</math> and <math>\\psi</math>) is seen to be:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{int} = i g \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu A_\\mu \\psi</math>\n\nThe most basic [[Feynman diagram]] for a QED interaction between two [[fermion]]s is the exchange of a single photon, with no loops. Following the [[Feynman rules]], this therefore contributes two QED vertex factors (<math>i g Q \\gamma_\\mu</math>) to the potential, where Q is the QED-[[Charge (physics)#abstract definition|charge operator]] (Q gives the charge in terms of the electron charge, and hence is exactly \u22121 for electrons, etc.). For the photon in the diagram, the Feynman rules demand the contribution of one bosonic massless [[propagator]] <math>\\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{k^2}\\right)</math>. Ignoring the momentum on the external legs (the fermions), the potential is therefore:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int e^{\\frac {i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}}{\\hbar}}\n(i Q_1 g^2 \\gamma_\\mu)(i Q_2 g^2 \\gamma_\\nu) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{k^2}\\right) \\;d^3k</math>\n\nwhich can be more usefully written as\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- g^2 \\hbar c Q_1 Q_2}{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int e^{\\frac {i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}}{\\hbar}} \\frac {4\\pi \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} }{k^2} \\;d^3k</math>\n\nwhere <math>Q_i</math> is the QED-charge on the ''i''th particle. Recognising the integral as just being a [[Fourier transform]] enables the equation to be simplified:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- g^2 \\hbar c Q_1 Q_2 }{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{r}.</math>\n\nFor various reasons, it is more convenient to define the [[fine-structure constant]] <math>\\alpha = \\frac{g^2}{4 \\pi}</math>, and then define <math>e = \\sqrt{4 \\pi \\alpha \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar c }</math>. Rearranging these definitions gives:\n\n:<math>g^2 \\hbar c = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0}</math>\n\nIn natural units (<math>\\hbar = 1</math>, <math>c = 1</math>, and <math>\\varepsilon_0 = 1</math>), <math>g = e</math>. Continuing in SI units, the potential is therefore\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{- e^2 }{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r}</math>\n\nDefining <math>q_i = e Q_i</math>, as the macroscopic 'electric charge', makes e the macroscopic 'electric charge' for an electron, and enables the formula to be put into the familiar form of the Coulomb potential:\n\n:<math>V(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{-1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}</math>\n\nThe force (<math>\\frac{dV(\\mathbf{r})}{dr}</math>) is therefore :\n\n:<math>F(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}</math>\n\nThe derivation makes clear that the force law is only an approximation \u2014 it ignores the momentum of the input and output fermion lines, and ignores all quantum corrections (i.e. the myriad possible diagrams with internal loops).\n\nThe Coulomb potential, and its derivation, can be seen as a special case of the [[Yukawa potential]] (specifically, the case where the exchanged boson \u2013 the photon \u2013 has no rest mass).\n\n== Scalar form ==\n[[Image:CoulombsLaw.svg|thumb|right|The absolute value of the force {{math|'''F'''}} between two [[point charge]]s {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''Q''}} relates to the distance between the point charges and to the simple product of their charges.

The force acting on a point charge due to a system of point charges is simply the [[vector addition]] of the individual forces acting alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges.

Consider two small spheres of mass {{math|''m''}} and same-sign charge {{math|''q''}}, hanging from two ropes of negligible mass of length {{math|''l''}}. The forces acting on each sphere are three: the weight {{math|''mg''}}, the rope tension {{math|''T''}} and the electric force {{math|''F''}}.\n\nIn the equilibrium state:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>T \\ \\sin \\theta_1 =F_1 \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nand:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>T \\ \\cos \\theta_1 =mg \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nDividing ({{EquationNote|1}}) by ({{EquationNote|2}}):\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac {\\sin \\theta_1}{\\cos \\theta_1 }=\n\\frac {F_1}{mg}\\Rightarrow F_1= mg \\tan \\theta_1 </math>\n|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nLet {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} be the distance between the charged spheres; the repulsion force between them {{math|''F''{{sub|1}}}}, assuming Coulomb's law is correct, is equal to\n\n{{NumBlk||\n: <math> F_1 = \\frac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Coulomb's law}}}}\n\nso:\n{{NumBlk||\n: <math>\\frac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2}=mg \\tan \\theta_1 \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nIf we now discharge one of the spheres, and we put it in contact with the charged sphere, each one of them acquires a charge {{math|{{sfrac|''q''|2}}}}. In the equilibrium state, the distance between the charges will be {{math|''L''{{sub|2}} < ''L''{{sub|1}}}} and the repulsion force between them will be:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>F_2 = \\frac{{(\\frac{q}{2})}^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}=\\frac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2} \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nWe know that {{math|''F''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''mg'' tan ''\u03b8''{{sub|2}}}}. And:\n:<math>\\frac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}=mg \\tan \\theta_2</math>\n\nDividing ({{EquationNote|4}}) by ({{EquationNote|5}}), we get: \n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac{\\left( \\cfrac{q^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_1^2} \\right)}{\\left(\\cfrac{\\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 L_2^2}\\right)} = \\frac{mg \\tan \\theta_1}{mg \\tan \\theta_2} \\Rightarrow 4 {\\left( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 =  \\frac{ \\tan \\theta_1}{ \\tan \\theta_2}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nMeasuring the angles {{math|''\u03b8''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''\u03b8''{{sub|2}}}} and the distance between the charges {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''L''{{sub|2}}}} is sufficient to verify that the equality is true taking into account the experimental error. In practice, angles can be difficult to measure, so if the length of the ropes is sufficiently great, the angles will be small enough to make the following approximation:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\tan \\theta \\approx \\sin \\theta= \\frac{\\frac{L}{2}}{\\ell}=\\frac{L}{2\\ell} \\Rightarrow \\frac{ \\tan \\theta_1}{ \\tan \\theta_2} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{L_1}{2\\ell}}{\\frac{L_2}{2\\ell}}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nUsing this approximation, the relationship ({{EquationNote|6}}) becomes the much simpler expression:\n{{NumBlk||\n:<math>\\frac{\\frac{L_1}{2\\ell}}{\\frac{L_2}{2\\ell}}\\approx 4 {\\left ( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 \\Rightarrow \\,\\!</math> <math>\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\approx 4 {\\left ( \\frac {L_2}{L_1} \\right ) }^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\approx\\sqrt[3]{4} \\,\\!</math>\n|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nIn this way, the verification is limited to measuring the distance between the charges and check that the division approximates the theoretical value.\n\n== Atomic forces ==\n{{see also|Coulomb explosion}}\nCoulomb's law holds even within [[atom]]s, correctly describing the [[force]] between the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]] and each of the negatively charged [[electron]]s. This simple law also correctly accounts for the forces that bind atoms together to form [[molecule]]s and for the forces that bind atoms and molecules together to form solids and liquids. Generally, as the distance between [[ion]]s increases, the force of attraction, and binding energy, approach zero and [[ionic bonding]] is less favorable. As the magnitude of opposing charges increases, energy increases and ionic bonding is more favorable.\n\n== Relation to Gauss's law ==\n=== Deriving Gauss's law from Coulomb's law ===\n\nStrictly speaking, [[Gauss's law]] cannot be derived from Coulomb's law alone, since Coulomb's law gives the electric field due to an individual [[point charge]] only. However, Gauss's law ''can'' be proven from Coulomb's law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field obeys the [[superposition principle]]. The superposition principle says that the resulting field is the vector sum of fields generated by each particle (or the integral, if the charges are distributed smoothly in space).\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Outline of proof\n|-\n|[[Coulomb's law]] states that the electric field due to a stationary [[point charge]] is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\mathbf{e}_r}{r^2}</math>\nwhere\n:{{math|'''e'''<sub>''r''</sub>}} is the radial [[unit vector]],\n:{{mvar|r}} is the radius, {{math|{{abs|'''r'''}}}},\n:{{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[electric constant]],\n:{{mvar|q}} is the charge of the particle, which is assumed to be located at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]].\n\nUsing the expression from Coulomb's law, we get the total field at {{math|'''r'''}} by using an integral to sum the field at {{math|'''r'''}} due to the infinitesimal charge at each other point {{math|'''s'''}} in space, to give\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{s})(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|^3} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{s}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the charge density. If we take the divergence of both sides of this equation with respect to '''r''', and use the known theorem<ref>See, for example, {{cite book | last=Griffiths | first=David J. | title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |edition=4th | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=2013 | page=50 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^3}\\right) = 4\\pi \\delta(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b4''('''r''')}} is the [[Dirac delta function]], the result is\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{s})\\, \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s})\\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{s}</math>\n\nUsing the \"[[Dirac delta function#Translation|sifting property]]\" of the Dirac delta function, we arrive at\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\varepsilon_0},</math>\n\nwhich is the differential form of Gauss' law, as desired.\n|}\n\nNote that since Coulomb's law only applies to stationary charges, there is no reason to expect Gauss's law to hold for moving charges based on this derivation alone. In fact, Gauss's law does hold for moving charges, and in this respect Gauss's law is more general than Coulomb's law.\n\n=== Deriving Coulomb's law from Gauss's law ===\nStrictly speaking, Coulomb's law cannot be derived from Gauss's law alone, since Gauss's law does not give any information regarding the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of {{math|'''E'''}} (see [[Helmholtz decomposition]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]). However, Coulomb's law ''can'' be proven from Gauss's law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field from a [[point charge]] is spherically symmetric (this assumption, like Coulomb's law itself, is exactly true if the charge is stationary, and approximately true if the charge is in motion).\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Outline of proof\n|-\n|Taking {{mvar|S}} in the integral form of Gauss' law to be a spherical surface of radius {{mvar|r}}, centered at the point charge {{mvar|Q}}, we have\n\n:<math>\\oint_S\\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} </math>\n\nBy the assumption of spherical symmetry, the integrand is a constant which can be taken out of the integral. The result is\n\n: <math>4\\pi r^2\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''r\u0302'''}} is a [[unit vector]] pointing radially away from the charge. Again by spherical symmetry, {{math|'''E'''}} points in the radial direction, and so we get\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}</math>\n\nwhich is essentially equivalent to Coulomb's law. Thus the [[inverse-square law]] dependence of the electric field in Coulomb's law follows from Gauss' law.\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Coulomb's law}}\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Biot\u2013Savart law]]\n* [[Darwin Lagrangian]]\n* [[Electromagnetic force]]\n* [[Gauss's law]]\n* [[Method of image charges]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which uses a similar structure, but for mass instead of charge\n* [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Huray |first1=Paul G. |title=Maxwell's equations |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ| isbn=0470542764 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jackson |first=J.

Humphrey''' (born June 29, 1944) is a former [[American football]] [[defensive end]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Humphrey was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2014.\n\n==Professional career==\nHumphrey was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] out of [[Tennessee State University]] in the first round of the [[1968 NFL Draft]] with the third overall choice by the Falcons. Humphrey was an [[1967 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in 1967.\n\nHumphrey's stellar career included being named First-team All-Pro five times (1971\u201374, and 1977), Second- Team All-Pro three times (1969, 1970, 1976), and All-NFC six times (1970\u201374, 1977).  He was second-team All-NFC in 1976 when Humphrey unofficially recorded a career high 15 quarterback sacks. In addition Humphrey was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] six times over the span of his career (1970\u201374 & 1977).\n\nHumphrey finished out his career with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1979\u201381. In 1980 Humphrey was a designated pass rusher, recording a team high 14\u00bd sacks helping the Eagles become NFC champions and earn a spot in [[Super Bowl XV]]. He finished his career with an unofficial 126\u00bd career sacks with the Falcons and Eagles. He retired in 1981, the season before sacks were recorded as an official NFL statistic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nDuring Super Bowl XV, Humphrey was called for roughing the passer against [[Oakland Raiders]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]]. Humphrey picked up the penalty flag and fired it back at referee [[Ben Dreith]].\n\nHumphrey is a member of the Georgia Hall of Fame and the Tennessee Hall of Fame.

Humphrey''' (born June 29, 1944) is a former [[American football]] [[defensive end]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Humphrey was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2014.\n\n==Professional career==\nHumphrey was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] out of [[Tennessee State University]] in the first round of the [[1968 NFL Draft]] with the third overall choice by the Falcons. Humphrey was an [[1967 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in 1967.\n\nHumphrey's stellar career included being named First-team All-Pro five times (1971\u201374, and 1977), Second- Team All-Pro three times (1969, 1970, 1976), and All-NFC six times (1970\u201374, 1977).  He was second-team All-NFC in 1976 when Humphrey unofficially recorded a career high 15 quarterback sacks. In addition Humphrey was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] six times over the span of his career (1970\u201374 & 1977).\n\nHumphrey finished out his career with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1979\u201381. In 1980 Humphrey was a designated pass rusher, recording a team high 14\u00bd sacks helping the Eagles become NFC champions and earn a spot in [[Super Bowl XV]]. He finished his career with an unofficial 126\u00bd career sacks with the Falcons and Eagles. He retired in 1981, the season before sacks were recorded as an official NFL statistic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nDuring Super Bowl XV, Humphrey was called for roughing the passer against [[Oakland Raiders]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]]. Humphrey picked up the penalty flag and fired it back at referee [[Ben Dreith]].\n\nHumphrey is a member of the Georgia Hall of Fame and the Tennessee Hall of Fame.

People of this ethnicity have, besides Portuguese, a strong [[Dutch people|Dutch]] heritage, as well as some [[British people|British]], [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]], [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] heritage due to intermarriages, which is common among the Kristang. In addition, due to perseccution by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in the region, a lot of the [[History of the Jews in Malaysia| Jews of Malacca]] assimilated into the Kristang community.<ref>Humanistic & Secular Jews Build Communities and Congregations Worldwide: Malaysia {{cite web |url=http://ifshj.net/id5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027214511/http://ifshj.net/id5.html |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The creole group arose in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] (part of present-day [[Malaysia]]) between the 16th and 17th centuries, when the city was a port and base of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Some descendants speak a distinctive [[Kristang language]] or Malacca Portuguese, a [[creole language|creole]] based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Today the government classifies them as Portuguese Eurasians.\n\nThe Kristang language is formally called Malacca-Melayu Portuguese Creole, made up of elements of each.<ref>[http://www.joanmarbeck.net/ ''Language Is the Soul of our Kristang Heritage''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528091418/http://www.joanmarbeck.net/ |date=28 May 2009 }}, Joan Marbeck Website, accessed 12 June 2009.</ref>  The Malay language, or ''Bahasa Melayu'', has changed to incorporate many Kristang words. For example, ''garfu'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''garfo'') is Kristang for \"fork\" and ''almari''  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''arm\u00e1rio'') is Kristang for \"cupboard\"; the Malay language incorporated these Kristang words whole.\n\nScholars believe the Kristang community originated in part from liaisons and marriages between Portuguese men (sailors, soldiers, traders, etc.) and local native women. The men came to Malacca during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|age of Portuguese explorations]], and in the early colonial years, Portuguese women did not settle in the colony. Nowadays intermarriage occurs more frequently between Kristang and people of Chinese and Indian ethnicity rather than Malay because of [[endogamous]] religious laws. These require non-Muslims intending to marry Malay-Muslims first to convert to Islam. Eurasians are not always willing to alter their religious and cultural identity in this way. In earlier centuries, Portuguese and local Malays were able to marry without such conversions, because such religious laws did not exist.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe name \"Kristang\" is sometimes incorrectly used for other [[Eurasian Singaporean|people of mixed European and Asian descent]] presently living in Malaysia and Singapore. This includes people of  Portuguese descent who were not part of the historical Kristang community, and people with other European ancestry, such as [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[British diaspora|British]].\n\nThe name comes from  the Portuguese creole ''Kristang'' (Christian), derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Crist\u00e3o''. A [[derogatory term]] for the Malacca Portuguese community was ''Grago'' or ''Gragok'' (slang term for Portuguese ''camar\u00e3o'' (shrimp), referring to the fact that the Portuguese Malaccans were traditionally shrimp fishermen).<ref>Julian Wong, \"When Exactly Can You Call an Eurasian a \u2018Grago\u2019?\" [https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-when-exactly-can-you-call-an-eurasian-a-grago]/</ref> In the native tongue, they also call themselves '''Gente Kristang''' (Christian people).\n\n==History==\n\n===Portuguese expeditions===\nMalacca was a major destination in the great wave of sea expeditions launched by [[Portugal]] around the turn of the 16th century. It eventually was controlled as part of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The first Portuguese expedition to reach Malacca landed in 1507. The ''Sejarah Melayu'' (''[[Malay Annals]]'') noted that the Malays first called them ''Bengali Puteh'' (White Bengalis), as the Portuguese brought to mind traders from Bengal but were more pale skinned. In the early years, the Malays called the Portuguese '''Serani''' (a Malay contraction of the Arabic ''[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]]'', meaning followers of [[Jesus]] the Nazarene).<ref>[http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/fernandis.pdf Gerard Fernandis, \"Paipia, Relijang e Tradisang\" (People, Religion and Tradition), The Portuguese Eurasians in Malayasia: 'Bumiquest', \"A Search for Self Identity\"], ''Lusotopie'', 2000, Sciences Politiques - Bordeaux, accessed 12 June 2009.</ref>  A story was recorded that the Portuguese landing party inadvertently insulted the Malaccan [[sultan]] by placing a [[garland]] of flowers on his head, and he had them detained. In 1511, a Portuguese fleet came from [[Portuguese India|India]] to free the landing party and [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquer Malacca]].\n\nAt that time, Portuguese women were barred from travelling overseas due to superstition about women on ships, as well as the substantial danger of the sea route around [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Following the Portuguese colonization of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) in 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local indigenous women, under a policy set by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], then [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India|India]]. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Albuquerque's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished and some 200 were recorded by 1604. By creating families, the Portuguese men would make more settled communities, with families whose children would be Catholic and loyal to the Crown.\n\n===The Dutch takeover===\nA powerful sea power, the rising [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] nation took Malacca from the Portuguese in 1641. This coincided with the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] in Portugal that ended the 60-year period known as the \"Union of the Crowns\" (1580\u20131640), when the crown of Portugal was joined with the crown of Spain by [[personal union]]. Almost all political contact between Portugal and Malacca ended, and a large number of people of Portuguese descent in the city were evacuated to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]](now Jakarta), the [[Dutch East India Company]] headquarters, as war captives, where they settled in an area called \"[[Koja, Jakarta|Kampung Tugu]]\".<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=East of Bali: From Lombok to Timor|author1=M\u00fcller, K.|author2=Pickell, D.|date=1997|publisher=Periplus|isbn=9789625931784|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSmqaNFttVkC|page=217|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>  Portuguese trade relations with the former colonial outpost of Macau have continued to this day.\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its traditions, practicing [[Catholicism]] and using the Portuguese language within the community. Some [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch crypto-Catholics]] were also absorbed into the community during this time.\n\n==Present status==\nThe Kristang community still has cultural and linguistic continuities with today's Portugal, especially with the [[Minho Province|Minho]] region, from where many early settlers emigrated. The Kristang continue to hold some church services in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Malaysians, including themselves, often refer to the community as \"Portuguese\". As the Kristang language is not taught in schools, it is nearing extinction, with the exception of within the [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] in ''[[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Ujong Pasir Malacca]]''.\n\nThe Kristang people in Malaysia do not have full ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputra]]'' status, a status which applies to [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic]] groups. However they have been given the privilege to apply to be members of a trust scheme known as ''Amanah Saham Bumiputra''. This is a privilege shared by Malaysians of [[Malaysian Siamese|Thai]] descent. The government sponsored this program to help the Malays increase their participation in the national economy. The Kristang community in Singapore is part of a larger umbrella group, known generically as the [[Eurasian Singaporean|Eurasian]] community. Some members have emigrated to [[Perth, Western Australia]] over the past three decades.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] is a thriving Kristang community in Malacca, established in 1933 with the goal of gathering the dispersed Kristang community and preserving their culture. A simple village of poor fishermen for many decades, it has recently become a major tourist attraction. This has helped to improve the income of the Kristang population.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fishing===\nSince Portuguese times, the Kristang have been living by the sea. It is still an important part of their culture. Even today, with only 10 percent of the community earning their living by fishing, many men go fishing to supplement their income or just to relax with their neighbours. Traditionally men fish from small wooden ''[[perahu]]s'', or by pushing the ''[[langgiang]]'', a traditional [[bamboo]]-poled shrimp net through the shallows.\n\n===Music and dance===\nKristang traditional music and dance, such as the ''[[Branyo]]'' and the ''Farrapeira'' are descendants of Portuguese folk dances. The [[Branyo]], descends from the southern Portuguese folk dance [[Corridinho]], and can be easily mistaken for the Malay ''[[Joget]]'' dance, which is believed to have developed from the Branyo. The adoption of western music instruments and musical scales by traditional Malay and Indian orchestras suggests a strong Portuguese influence. The most popular branyo tune, ''Jingkli Nona'', is regarded as the unofficial \"anthem\" for Portuguese Eurasians.\n\n===Cuisine===\nKristang or Malacca Portuguese cuisine consists of heavy local influence, with the additions of stews and the inclusion of pork and seafood in the diet, and rice is the staple food. Among the many dishes in Kristang cuisine, the most popular is [[Devil's curry|Cari Debal]]. Other popular delicacies include Portuguese grilled fish, pineapple prawn Curry, Cari Seccu (dry curry), Caldu Pescador (Fisherman's soup), Sambal Chili Bedri (green chilli [[sambal]]), Soy Limang, Porku Tambrinyu (pork tamarind stew), Achar Pesi (fish pickle), Pang Su Si (Su Si Bun), and Sugee Cake. As is the custom, Kristang people commonly eat using their hands instead of utensils. It is similar to the [[Eurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia]]\n\n===Names===\nThe Kristang people traditionally used [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] and Christian first names, while their surnames were Portuguese. Among the many common surnames are [[Fernandes]], [[Lopes]], [[Santamaria (disambiguation)|Santa Maria]], [[Siqueira]], [[Costa (surname)|De Costa]], [[Pereira (surname)|Pereira]], [[Teixeira]], [[Gomes]] and [[Pinto (disambiguation)|Pinto]].\n\n==Religion==\nIn general the Kristang practice [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. [[Christmas]] (''Natal'') is the most festive occasion of the year, when many Kristang families get together to celebrate by eating seasonal dishes, singing  [[Carol (music)|carols]] and ''branyok'', and revelling in ''[[saudade|saudadi]]''. Like many other Portuguese-speaking Catholic communities around the world, the Kristang also celebrate a string of major [[Calendar of saints|Saints' days]] at the end of June, beginning with [[John the Baptist|St. John]] (''San Juang'') on 24 June and closing with [[Peter the Apostle|St. Peter]] (''San Pedro''), the fishermen's [[patron saint]], on 29 June. The June festival of [[Saint John, Malacca|St. John's village]] is a major tourist attraction of Malacca. Tourists come to observe the festivities, which are religiously based. Besides that, there are also a minority of former Kristang Christians who had rediscovered their Sephardic Jewish roots and returned to Judaism. This led to the establishment of the Kristang Community for Cultural [[Judaism]] (KCCJ) in 2010 which is no longer in operation due to political reasons.\n\n==Portuguese influence on Malay language==\nThe Portuguese ruled Malacca from 1511 to 1641. About 300 Portuguese words were adopted in the Malay language. These include:\n* ''kereta'' (from ''carreta'', car);\n* ''sekolah'' (from ''escola'', school);\n* ''bendera'' (from ''bandeira'', flag);\n* ''mentega'' (from ''manteiga'', butter);\n* ''keju'' (from ''queijo'', cheese);\n* ''gereja'' (from ''igreja'', church);\n* ''meja'' (from ''mesa'', table); and\n* ''nenas'' (from ''anan\u00e1s'', pineapple).\n\n==Notable Kristang people==\n\n'''Malaysian'''\n*[[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] - a Malaysian scholar specializing in the study of the Malay-Portuguese Creole language [[Kristang language]]\nin Malaysia and other countries ([[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Macau]]).\n*[[Marion Caunter]] - TV personality\n*[[Bernard Sta Maria]] - Author of 'The Golden Son of Kadazan' and 'My People My Country' - Malacca Portuguese leader/politician\n*[[Joseph Sta Maria]] - Author of 'Undi Nos By Di Aki' (Where Do We Go From Here?) - Portuguese community advisor/social activist.\n* [[Peter van Huizen]] - Malaysian hockey goalkeeper (1956 Olympics).\n* [[Tan Sri Tony Fernandes]] - CEO of Air Asia (Maternal).\n* [[Dr. Siri Roland Xavier]] - Well known Malaysian International Professor of Entrepreneurship.\n* [[Datuk Eugene Campos]] - The Hon.

After the death of Jimmy Boyle, Larry led the band with Steve (Rozells) Ooi on piano, and continued performing at the Penang Club until he had a stroke while performing at the club in 1981. All through the years, Larry Rodrigues thrilled audiences in pubs, hotels and clubs with his style of playing and till today many guitarists still remember and marvel at the guitar playing style of Larry Rodrigues. Uncle Larry also made numerous recordings with Radio Malaysia where he played many of Jimmy Boyle\u2019s compositions. Larry\u2019s proudest musical moment was when the great American jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd performed in Penang in the 1970s and invited Larry to jam with him.\n*Tan Sri Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta.

People of this ethnicity have, besides Portuguese, a strong [[Dutch people|Dutch]] heritage, as well as some [[British people|British]], [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]], [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] heritage due to intermarriages, which is common among the Kristang. In addition, due to perseccution by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in the region, a lot of the [[History of the Jews in Malaysia| Jews of Malacca]] assimilated into the Kristang community.<ref>Humanistic & Secular Jews Build Communities and Congregations Worldwide: Malaysia {{cite web |url=http://ifshj.net/id5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027214511/http://ifshj.net/id5.html |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The creole group arose in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] (part of present-day [[Malaysia]]) between the 16th and 17th centuries, when the city was a port and base of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Some descendants speak a distinctive [[Kristang language]] or Malacca Portuguese, a [[creole language|creole]] based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Today the government classifies them as Portuguese Eurasians.\n\nThe Kristang language is formally called Malacca-Melayu Portuguese Creole, made up of elements of each.<ref>[http://www.joanmarbeck.net/ ''Language Is the Soul of our Kristang Heritage''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528091418/http://www.joanmarbeck.net/ |date=28 May 2009 }}, Joan Marbeck Website, accessed 12 June 2009.</ref>  The Malay language, or ''Bahasa Melayu'', has changed to incorporate many Kristang words. For example, ''garfu'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''garfo'') is Kristang for \"fork\" and ''almari''  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''arm\u00e1rio'') is Kristang for \"cupboard\"; the Malay language incorporated these Kristang words whole.\n\nScholars believe the Kristang community originated in part from liaisons and marriages between Portuguese men (sailors, soldiers, traders, etc.) and local native women. The men came to Malacca during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|age of Portuguese explorations]], and in the early colonial years, Portuguese women did not settle in the colony. Nowadays intermarriage occurs more frequently between Kristang and people of Chinese and Indian ethnicity rather than Malay because of [[endogamous]] religious laws. These require non-Muslims intending to marry Malay-Muslims first to convert to Islam. Eurasians are not always willing to alter their religious and cultural identity in this way. In earlier centuries, Portuguese and local Malays were able to marry without such conversions, because such religious laws did not exist.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe name \"Kristang\" is sometimes incorrectly used for other [[Eurasian Singaporean|people of mixed European and Asian descent]] presently living in Malaysia and Singapore. This includes people of  Portuguese descent who were not part of the historical Kristang community, and people with other European ancestry, such as [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[British diaspora|British]].\n\nThe name comes from  the Portuguese creole ''Kristang'' (Christian), derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Crist\u00e3o''. A [[derogatory term]] for the Malacca Portuguese community was ''Grago'' or ''Gragok'' (slang term for Portuguese ''camar\u00e3o'' (shrimp), referring to the fact that the Portuguese Malaccans were traditionally shrimp fishermen).<ref>Julian Wong, \"When Exactly Can You Call an Eurasian a \u2018Grago\u2019?\" [https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-when-exactly-can-you-call-an-eurasian-a-grago]/</ref> In the native tongue, they also call themselves '''Gente Kristang''' (Christian people).\n\n==History==\n\n===Portuguese expeditions===\nMalacca was a major destination in the great wave of sea expeditions launched by [[Portugal]] around the turn of the 16th century. It eventually was controlled as part of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The first Portuguese expedition to reach Malacca landed in 1507. The ''Sejarah Melayu'' (''[[Malay Annals]]'') noted that the Malays first called them ''Bengali Puteh'' (White Bengalis), as the Portuguese brought to mind traders from Bengal but were more pale skinned. In the early years, the Malays called the Portuguese '''Serani''' (a Malay contraction of the Arabic ''[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]]'', meaning followers of [[Jesus]] the Nazarene).<ref>[http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/fernandis.pdf Gerard Fernandis, \"Paipia, Relijang e Tradisang\" (People, Religion and Tradition), The Portuguese Eurasians in Malayasia: 'Bumiquest', \"A Search for Self Identity\"], ''Lusotopie'', 2000, Sciences Politiques - Bordeaux, accessed 12 June 2009.</ref>  A story was recorded that the Portuguese landing party inadvertently insulted the Malaccan [[sultan]] by placing a [[garland]] of flowers on his head, and he had them detained. In 1511, a Portuguese fleet came from [[Portuguese India|India]] to free the landing party and [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquer Malacca]].\n\nAt that time, Portuguese women were barred from travelling overseas due to superstition about women on ships, as well as the substantial danger of the sea route around [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Following the Portuguese colonization of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) in 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local indigenous women, under a policy set by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], then [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India|India]]. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Albuquerque's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished and some 200 were recorded by 1604. By creating families, the Portuguese men would make more settled communities, with families whose children would be Catholic and loyal to the Crown.\n\n===The Dutch takeover===\nA powerful sea power, the rising [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] nation took Malacca from the Portuguese in 1641. This coincided with the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] in Portugal that ended the 60-year period known as the \"Union of the Crowns\" (1580\u20131640), when the crown of Portugal was joined with the crown of Spain by [[personal union]]. Almost all political contact between Portugal and Malacca ended, and a large number of people of Portuguese descent in the city were evacuated to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]](now Jakarta), the [[Dutch East India Company]] headquarters, as war captives, where they settled in an area called \"[[Koja, Jakarta|Kampung Tugu]]\".<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=East of Bali: From Lombok to Timor|author1=M\u00fcller, K.|author2=Pickell, D.|date=1997|publisher=Periplus|isbn=9789625931784|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSmqaNFttVkC|page=217|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>  Portuguese trade relations with the former colonial outpost of Macau have continued to this day.\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its traditions, practicing [[Catholicism]] and using the Portuguese language within the community. Some [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch crypto-Catholics]] were also absorbed into the community during this time.\n\n==Present status==\nThe Kristang community still has cultural and linguistic continuities with today's Portugal, especially with the [[Minho Province|Minho]] region, from where many early settlers emigrated. The Kristang continue to hold some church services in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Malaysians, including themselves, often refer to the community as \"Portuguese\". As the Kristang language is not taught in schools, it is nearing extinction, with the exception of within the [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] in ''[[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Ujong Pasir Malacca]]''.\n\nThe Kristang people in Malaysia do not have full ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputra]]'' status, a status which applies to [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic]] groups. However they have been given the privilege to apply to be members of a trust scheme known as ''Amanah Saham Bumiputra''. This is a privilege shared by Malaysians of [[Malaysian Siamese|Thai]] descent. The government sponsored this program to help the Malays increase their participation in the national economy. The Kristang community in Singapore is part of a larger umbrella group, known generically as the [[Eurasian Singaporean|Eurasian]] community. Some members have emigrated to [[Perth, Western Australia]] over the past three decades.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] is a thriving Kristang community in Malacca, established in 1933 with the goal of gathering the dispersed Kristang community and preserving their culture. A simple village of poor fishermen for many decades, it has recently become a major tourist attraction. This has helped to improve the income of the Kristang population.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fishing===\nSince Portuguese times, the Kristang have been living by the sea. It is still an important part of their culture. Even today, with only 10 percent of the community earning their living by fishing, many men go fishing to supplement their income or just to relax with their neighbours. Traditionally men fish from small wooden ''[[perahu]]s'', or by pushing the ''[[langgiang]]'', a traditional [[bamboo]]-poled shrimp net through the shallows.\n\n===Music and dance===\nKristang traditional music and dance, such as the ''[[Branyo]]'' and the ''Farrapeira'' are descendants of Portuguese folk dances. The [[Branyo]], descends from the southern Portuguese folk dance [[Corridinho]], and can be easily mistaken for the Malay ''[[Joget]]'' dance, which is believed to have developed from the Branyo. The adoption of western music instruments and musical scales by traditional Malay and Indian orchestras suggests a strong Portuguese influence. The most popular branyo tune, ''Jingkli Nona'', is regarded as the unofficial \"anthem\" for Portuguese Eurasians.\n\n===Cuisine===\nKristang or Malacca Portuguese cuisine consists of heavy local influence, with the additions of stews and the inclusion of pork and seafood in the diet, and rice is the staple food. Among the many dishes in Kristang cuisine, the most popular is [[Devil's curry|Cari Debal]]. Other popular delicacies include Portuguese grilled fish, pineapple prawn Curry, Cari Seccu (dry curry), Caldu Pescador (Fisherman's soup), Sambal Chili Bedri (green chilli [[sambal]]), Soy Limang, Porku Tambrinyu (pork tamarind stew), Achar Pesi (fish pickle), Pang Su Si (Su Si Bun), and Sugee Cake. As is the custom, Kristang people commonly eat using their hands instead of utensils. It is similar to the [[Eurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia]]\n\n===Names===\nThe Kristang people traditionally used [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] and Christian first names, while their surnames were Portuguese. Among the many common surnames are [[Fernandes]], [[Lopes]], [[Santamaria (disambiguation)|Santa Maria]], [[Siqueira]], [[Costa (surname)|De Costa]], [[Pereira (surname)|Pereira]], [[Teixeira]], [[Gomes]] and [[Pinto (disambiguation)|Pinto]].\n\n==Religion==\nIn general the Kristang practice [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. [[Christmas]] (''Natal'') is the most festive occasion of the year, when many Kristang families get together to celebrate by eating seasonal dishes, singing  [[Carol (music)|carols]] and ''branyok'', and revelling in ''[[saudade|saudadi]]''. Like many other Portuguese-speaking Catholic communities around the world, the Kristang also celebrate a string of major [[Calendar of saints|Saints' days]] at the end of June, beginning with [[John the Baptist|St. John]] (''San Juang'') on 24 June and closing with [[Peter the Apostle|St. Peter]] (''San Pedro''), the fishermen's [[patron saint]], on 29 June. The June festival of [[Saint John, Malacca|St. John's village]] is a major tourist attraction of Malacca. Tourists come to observe the festivities, which are religiously based. Besides that, there are also a minority of former Kristang Christians who had rediscovered their Sephardic Jewish roots and returned to Judaism. This led to the establishment of the Kristang Community for Cultural [[Judaism]] (KCCJ) in 2010 which is no longer in operation due to political reasons.\n\n==Portuguese influence on Malay language==\nThe Portuguese ruled Malacca from 1511 to 1641. About 300 Portuguese words were adopted in the Malay language. These include:\n* ''kereta'' (from ''carreta'', car);\n* ''sekolah'' (from ''escola'', school);\n* ''bendera'' (from ''bandeira'', flag);\n* ''mentega'' (from ''manteiga'', butter);\n* ''keju'' (from ''queijo'', cheese);\n* ''gereja'' (from ''igreja'', church);\n* ''meja'' (from ''mesa'', table); and\n* ''nenas'' (from ''anan\u00e1s'', pineapple).\n\n==Notable Kristang people==\n\n'''Malaysian'''\n*[[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] - a Malaysian scholar specializing in the study of the Malay-Portuguese Creole language [[Kristang language]]\nin Malaysia and other countries ([[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Macau]]).\n*[[Marion Caunter]] - TV personality\n*[[Bernard Sta Maria]] - Author of 'The Golden Son of Kadazan' and 'My People My Country' - Malacca Portuguese leader/politician\n*[[Joseph Sta Maria]] - Author of 'Undi Nos By Di Aki' (Where Do We Go From Here?) - Portuguese community advisor/social activist.\n* [[Peter van Huizen]] - Malaysian hockey goalkeeper (1956 Olympics).\n* [[Tan Sri Tony Fernandes]] - CEO of Air Asia (Maternal).\n* [[Dr. Siri Roland Xavier]] - Well known Malaysian International Professor of Entrepreneurship.\n* [[Datuk Eugene Campos]] - The Hon.

Started playing with Jimmy Boyle in the 1940s at the Runnymede, Sandycroft and the Penang Club for more than 20 years. After the death of Jimmy Boyle, Larry led the band with Steve (Rozells) Ooi on piano, and continued performing at the Penang Club until he had a stroke while performing at the club in 1981. All through the years, Larry Rodrigues thrilled audiences in pubs, hotels and clubs with his style of playing and till today many guitarists still remember and marvel at the guitar playing style of Larry Rodrigues. Uncle Larry also made numerous recordings with Radio Malaysia where he played many of Jimmy Boyle\u2019s compositions. Larry\u2019s proudest musical moment was when the great American jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd performed in Penang in the 1970s and invited Larry to jam with him.\n*Tan Sri Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta.

People call it emerald. When the glaciers melt, the lake becomes a bright green color, especially if you look at it from above. The color of the lake's water depends not only on [[snowmelt]], but also on the time of day and weather. In spring and summer, the water is muddy the color of coffee with milk, in autumn and spring, it becomes transparent blue. At noon, the water has a turquoise hue, with a blue sky, the water becomes the color of ultramarine, in cloudy weather it becomes leaden. The greatest length of lake Superior from the North shore to the South, to the mouth of the river Aguacate is {{cvt|2.07|km}}, the greatest width in the Northern part of the lake \u2013 {{cvt|751|m}}, depth presumably {{cvt|30 to 50|m}} of mirror area \u2013 {{cvt|912,000|sqm}}. {{cvt|9|km}}, to the South, from lake Superior, the river takes Aguacate Eastern [[tributary]] of the river Ekiasha, which in turn is formed by the confluence of two small rivers \u2013 Western tributary of the river Balcony and East of a tributary of the Bark. The Kora river originates from the meltwater of the Satpayev glacier, which ends in the South with the Kara-Choki pass, along which the state border between Kazakhstan and the Republic of China runs in the latitudinal direction. The dense forest starts from the height of {{cvt|1200|m}}. Here grow fir, spruce, aspen, birch and poplar. It is here in Dzungaria that the most apple trees in [[Kazakhstan]] remain (49%), including the [[Malus sieversii|Sievers apple]] tree, which is the ancestor of all most domestic apple trees on Earth.\n\nOn the shores of the lake, deciduous groves have grown, which acquire a special beauty in autumn. The area of lake Zhasylkol is an excellent habitat for a large population of marals. Until the eighties of the last century, almost no human set foot here, which is not surprising, because the state border between [[China]] and [[Kazakhstan]] passes here. Traveling here is a great opportunity where virgin nature is evident with its magical views.\n\nThe lake is located in Zhetysu Alatau, {{cvt|23|km}} southwest of the village of [[Lepsinsk]], in the middle reaches of the Kikozen river, one of the sources of the Agynykatty river. From the wheat apiary to the lake along the path winding along the valley of the Agynykatty river \u2013 about {{cvt|10|km}}, from the lake to the Jaeger cordon Zhalanash more than {{cvt|13|km}}.\nThe object is part of the state national nature Park Zhongar-Alatau<ref name=\"sarkan-zhongaralatau-kz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sarkan-zhongaralatau-kz.online|title=\u041c\u043e\u044f \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 - www.sarkan-zhongaralatau-kz.online|website=sarkan-zhongaralatau-kz.online|accessdate=2020-03-22}}</ref> and has a favorable acoustic environment (e.g. silence and melodic sounds in nature).

Accessed March 8, 2020.</ref> The township got its name from New Brunswick, which in turn was named after the city of [[Braunschweig]] (called ''Brunswick'' in the [[Low German]] language), in state of [[Lower Saxony]], in [[Germany]]. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the [[Hanseatic League]], later in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the [[House of Hanover]] (also known as the ''House of Brunswick''), became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I of Great Britain]] (1660\u20131727). Alternatively, the city derived its name from King [[George II of Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]].<ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.

In 1885, it redefined and enlarged the boundaries of Cranbury, and [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro Township]] was formed in 1919. The present boundaries of South Brunswick date back to this last change.<ref name=Story/>\n\nDuring the 20th century, South Brunswick saw extensive transformation with the impact of changes in transportation technology. The [[New Brunswick and Trenton Fast Line]] began operation in 1900, a trolley line running parallel to the Old Straight Turnpike of 1804 ([[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|Route 1]]), intersecting George's Road just north of the Five Corners intersection in Dayton. This trolley provided daily passenger and freight service, stopping at a local crossroads. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] opened in 1951, again roughly parallel to Route 1, on the eastern edge of the Township. One effect of the Turnpike opening up Interchange 8A (just outside the township) was the transformation of the agricultural area on the southeast corner of South Brunswick to that of a burgeoning industrial development. Significant portions of land between Route 130 and the [[New Jersey Turnpike|turnpike]] consist largely of warehouses.<ref>Cifelli, Melissa.

Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the [[Hanseatic League]], later in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the [[House of Hanover]] (also known as the ''House of Brunswick''), became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I of Great Britain]] (1660\u20131727).

In 1885, it redefined and enlarged the boundaries of Cranbury, and [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro Township]] was formed in 1919. The present boundaries of South Brunswick date back to this last change.<ref name=Story/>\n\nDuring the 20th century, South Brunswick saw extensive transformation with the impact of changes in transportation technology. The [[New Brunswick and Trenton Fast Line]] began operation in 1900, a trolley line running parallel to the Old Straight Turnpike of 1804 ([[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|Route 1]]), intersecting George's Road just north of the Five Corners intersection in Dayton. This trolley provided daily passenger and freight service, stopping at a local crossroads. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] opened in 1951, again roughly parallel to Route 1, on the eastern edge of the Township. One effect of the Turnpike opening up Interchange 8A (just outside the township) was the transformation of the agricultural area on the southeast corner of South Brunswick to that of a burgeoning industrial development. Significant portions of land between Route 130 and the [[New Jersey Turnpike|turnpike]] consist largely of warehouses.<ref>Cifelli, Melissa.

A major part of this geography lasted till historical times. The loss of the jungle was due to human activity. Bengal had an early human presence. But there is no consensus for the timeframe of the first human activity in Bengal nor are there plenty of remains. One view contends that humans entered Bengal from China 60,000 years ago. Another view claims that a distinct regional culture emerged 100,000 years ago. There is weak evidence for a prehistoric human presence in the region.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 11\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=11}}</ref> There is scant evidence of a human presence during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 12\"/> This could be because of the shifts in the rivers' courses.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 12\"/> The Bengali climate and geography is not suitable for tangible archaeological remains.

Industries of fossilwood manufacturing blades, scrapers and axes have been discovered in Lalmai, Sitakund and Chaklapunji. These have been connected with similar findings in Burma and West Bengal. Large stones, thought to be prehistoric, were constructed in north eastern Bangladesh and are similar to those in India's nearby hills. Farming was practised before the first millennium BCE.

In 326&nbsp;BCE, with the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]] the region again came to prominence. The Greek and Latin historians suggested that Alexander the Great withdrew from India anticipating the valiant counter-attack of the mighty [[Gangaridai]] empire that was located in the Bengal region. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]], was convinced that it was better to return. [[Diodorus Siculus]] mentions Gangaridai to be the most powerful empire in India whose king possessed an army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war. The allied forces of Gangaridai Empire and [[Nanda Empire]] (Prasii) were preparing a massive counter-attack against the forces of Alexander on the banks of Ganges. Gangaridai, according to the Greek accounts, kept on flourishing at least up to the 1st century AD.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\nBengal was left on its own after Mauryan power declined. Little is known of the period after that although parts of Bengal were probably under the Pataliputra-based Sunga dynasty. During this time Pundra was still a significant Buddhist location. Local rulers retained power while paying tribute to the Gupta Empire in the 300s and 400s. The Bengal delta became the kingdom of Samatata; its hub near the contemporary Chandpur. A Gupta inscription indicates that the Gupta empire possessed influence in Samatata without ruling it directly. Bengal remained a frontier despite its rare associations with the Indian heartland. Several dynasties changed during the next few centuries. While not much information is available about them, plates and other forms of evidence obtained from the Comilla district indicate that Gopachandra ruled the area in the early 500s. The Khargas became rulers in the next century.

Gaur was ruled by Sasanka in the early 600s. He was based in Karnasuvarna in modern-day Murshidabad district. Contemporary Chinese reports and coinage suggest that he was a firm Shaivite who was vehemently opposed to Buddhism. Opposition to Buddhism and a commitment to Brahminism apparently continued under the Sura dynasty, founded by Adisura around 700 CE. Around the middle of the eighth century a firm Buddhist, Gopala, assumed power in Bengal, possibly supported by Buddhist chiefs who were opposed to the effects of the Suras and Sasanka's faithful Brahmanism.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 13\u20134\"/>\n\n=== Gauda Kingdom ===\n{{main|Gauda Kingdom}}\nBy the 6th century, the [[Gupta Empire]], which ruled over the northern Indian subcontinent had largely broken up. [[East Bengal|Eastern Bengal]] splintered into the kingdoms of Vanga, [[Samatata]] and [[Harikela]] while the [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]] kings rose in the west with their capital at [[Karnasuvarna]] (near modern [[Murshidabad]]). [[Shashanka]], a vassal of the last Gupta Emperor proclaimed independence and unified the smaller principalities of Bengal (Gaur, Vanga, Samatata). He vied for regional power with [[Harshavardhana]] in northern India after treacherously murdering Harsha's elder brother Rajyavardhana. Harsha's continuous pressure led to the gradual weakening of the Gauda kingdom founded by Shashanka and finally ended with his death.

He had come to power after a Bengali revolt against the Tughluq dynasty's governor. Shamsuddin's state was based in Pandua, modern-day Malda district. Shamsuddin drove up the Ganges to contest Tughluq rule. The Tughluqs, in return drove Ilyas Shah out of Pandua into eastern Bengal. Shamsuddin reclaimed Pandua and continued ruling Bengal. Shamsuddin's heir repelled Tughluq incursions and like his predecessor expanded the dynasty's authority into Bihar.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 18\"/>\n\nThe dynasty constructed grand buildings in Pandua. They built India's biggest mosque, the Adina mosque. Richard Eaton cites diplomatic accounts about the grandeur of Pandua's buildings.

The latter's duty was to keep charge over tax collection. The diwan was the most important tax officer and was directly selected by the Mughal ruler. Each Mughal conquest in Bengal was accompanied with the establishment of a thana (garrison) for the purpose of maintaining peace. After that the territory would be merged into the empire's administrative system. In the empire's system each province would comprise several regions, called \"sarkar\", which in turn would be made up of subdivisions called parganas. The lowest tier in the system was the mouza (revenue village).<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 52\"/>\n\nThe agricultural borderland during Mughal rule in the 1500s started moving towards the eastern portion of Bengal. The region's agricultural productivity increased. To increase their revenues the Mughal administration promoted forest clearing and wet-rice farming. The officials gave land grants to entrepreneurs who were willing to give taxes in exchange for rights over the lands. The colonists required labour and this was advantageous for the religious elite.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 30\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=30}}</ref> Most communities in the region were boatmen and fishermen on the margins of society who were nominally Hindu but in reality had very weak ties to Hinduism.

But most of the pioneers were Muslim. A large number of them were pirs. Richard Eaton asserts that Islam was understood to be linked with the government-accepted acquisition of land in eastern Bengal which had only weak connections with Hindu civilization. The traditions and rituals of eastern Bengal, mosques and shrines blended together. Islam spread in Bengal because of its localisation. Islamic agencies were inserted into the contemporary cosmology, were then associated with local divinities and eventually the Islamic agencies took over the local culture.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 30\"/> Local Hindus, in response to the conversion, closed ranks and became more conservative, expelling those who were 'polluted' by contact with Muslims.

The Portuguese traded and proselytised until 1632 when they were expelled by Shah Jahan, who allowed them to re-enter in the next year.

A Dutch station was established at Chinsura but the Dutch directed their interests to Ceylon and Southeast Asia. In 1825 they exchanged Chinsura with the British for posts in Southeast Asia. In 1755 a Danish station was established at Serampore. In 1845 the British bought it. The French Company lasted longer. Their position was second to the British. The latter overtook the French.

In 1652 the British had been exempted from customs payments in exchange for giving yearly sums to the nawab. But the nawab foisted fees upon them, which the British opposed.

Alivardi Khan disliked the British and French plans to secure their possessions. Alivardi Khan disputed the British application of Emperor Fakukhsiyar's order which had allowed the British unfettered trading privileges in the Mughal empire. Alivardi Khan was perturbed by the stipulation in the order which provided the British with tax exemptions on the transportation of goods. This meant lower revenues for Alivardi Khan.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 25\"/>\n\nAlivardi's successor Sirajuddaulah set about eliminating the foreign presence. In 1756 he seized Calcutta and incarcerated the resident British population. Robert Clive and his troops took Calcutta back in January 1757. Clive compelled Sirajuddaulah to assent to a treaty which would restore Emperor Fakukhsiyar's order allowing the British to trade unrestricted. Clive then conspired with Sirajuddaulah's relative, Mir Jafar, and obtained the support of a major banker, Jagat Seth. Robert Clive and Sirajuddaulah's troops battled each other at Plassey in June 1757.

In 1790 the British introduced \"permanent settlement\" and made it law three years later. It was a framework for taxation on land. The system was the core of the colonial form of government. It was an agreement between the British and the zamindars who were effectively given landholdings in exchange for timely payment of taxes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe aim of the permanent settlement was that the zamindars would eventually invest in the development of agriculture and improve the economy of Bengal. The aim did not materialise because the zamindars did not have state backing for agrarian growth and because of newfound ways of generating wealth. A common method was fleecing the peasants. The increasingly rich zamindars moved away from agrarian and taxation activities. They appointed intermediaries. A multilayered form of landholdings developed, which benefited from the land's revenue. This structure was most pronounced in the southern areas of modern Bangladesh. The permanent settlement scheme deprived peasants of any proprietary rights over the land.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=59}}</ref>\n\nWhile Muslims had comprised most of the landlord class during Mughal rule, Hindus became prominent during the colonial rule. While Muslim landlords and Hindu occupants did exist, eastern Bengal witnessed an amalgamation of religion with class, with Hindu landlords presiding over mainly Muslim peasants. Hindu landlords were also prominent in western Bengal, but most peasants there were Hindus. This factor would become politically important by the end of the colonial rule.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 60\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=60}}</ref>\n\nAnother change during British rule was the system of cash cropping. During colonial rule cash cropping was organised and produced for international markets. It was significant because of the links it created between the Bengali countryside's economy with markets in Asia and Europe.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 60\"/> Because of cash cropping the eastern region of modern Bangladesh emerged as the centre for jute cultivation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=60\u201363}}</ref> The western portion of modern Bangladesh produced silk and sugar. The northern areas produced tobacco. Crops were associated with specific types of land organisation. Peasantry in the eastern areas were compelled by financial needs towards market production. The countryside's elite in the western and northern areas were protected from the immediate impact of market factors because they provided agrarian credit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=63}}</ref>\n\nThe British abandoned the former official language, Persian, in the 1830s and English medum educational institutions prepared a small part of the Bengali elite for jobs in the lower and middle tiers of government.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=64}}</ref> Muslims took up the British improvements more slowly and lagged behind the Hindus educationally and commercially.

The population growth during colonial rule was because people had more knowledge of hygiene and increased access to hospitals and medication. Transport became less reliant on the rivers with the construction of bridges and railways. Improvements in technology aided communications. Despite the government's authoritarian form, the British tried out limited democratic systems in the later part of their rule due to political constraints.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\"/>\n\nA vital development under British rule was the rise of Calcutta to political and cultural prominence.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\"/> It became colonial India's capital. From 1757 to 1931 the Government of India was located in the city. Aspiring Bengalis migrated to Calcutta and obtained education and government employment. They are known to historians as the \"bhodrolok\" and high caste Hindus comprised most of them.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=65}}</ref> Old centers such as Dhaka and Murshidabad declined while the trading class became concentrated in Calcutta.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 29\"/>\n\nThe authoritarian regime functioning in alliance with the rural elite was susceptible to resistance and revolts happened frequently during the British rule. However, British rule in Bengal faced no threat by the second half of the 1800s. Bengal did not participate in the 1857 revolt which nearly ended British administration over large swathes of India. While there was a revolt by troops in Chittagong it dwindled because the landlords and peasants did not support the rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=77}}</ref> Instead political grievances nor revolved around peasant rights and the commercialization of agriculture. The struggle was usually characterised by peasants and the middle class in opposition to the landlords, Western businessmen and the British administration. Many campaigns eventually ended the indigo industry. These were led by Wahhabi influenced Islamic missionaries.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=78}}</ref>\n\nThere had been prominent Hindu reformist movements in the early 1800s but no equivalent Muslim movement. A departure from this rule was the Faraizi movement which Haji Shariatullah started in 1828. It was a conservative Islamic movement grounded in Wahhabi ideology. It opposed the exaltation of saints and the repression by landlords and indigo traders. Shariatullah regarded India as a dar al-harb and thus believed that festivals and Friday prayers should cease. His heir, Dudu Mia, expanded the movement and claimed that the landlords did not possess permanent land rights. The Faraizi movement eventually ended after his demise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=30|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref>\n\nTitu Mir led another Wahhabi campaign at the same time as the Faraizi movement. This movement was violent and opposed to the British presence. He died in 1831 during a confrontation with the British. Two years later his followers supported indigo farmers in a clash against the European planters and Hindu landlords. The protest was ultimately muted by 1860 when the peasants were granted more security.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=31|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref> But not all rural rebellions were inspired by religion.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\"/>\n\nBy the late 1800s parts of the elite and peasants became politically connected. This link was to become a crucial prototype of later campaigns in Bengal. The movement for self determination joined communist and nationalist movements, several of which were associated with all-India organisations.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\"/>\n\n===Bengal renaissance===\n{{Main|Bengal renaissance}}\n{|  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Bengal renaissance\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nImage:Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] is Asia's first [[Nobel laureate]] and composer of the national anthem of Bangladesh.\nimage:Nazrul.jpg|[[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], the [[national poet]] of Bangladesh.\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe [[Bengal renaissance]] refers to a social reform movement during the 19th and early 20th centuries in Bengal.

The second reason was that the initial enthusiasm of some Bengali Muslims for the protest against the partition diminished because of the protest's culture. The predominantly Hindu bhodrolok led the anti-partition campaign and connected it with Hindu revivalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=81}}</ref> They identified their homeland with Kali and selected Bande Mataram as anthem, which Muslims opposed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> The third reason was that Bengal's Muslims identified themselves as members of a community. The British had promoted religion as a grounds for political identification. This had been difficult because the Muslims of Bengal had not perceived themselves as a separate community. Muslim unity had been hindered by significant internal differences. Most Bengali Muslims had been more a member of a religiously diverse Bengali community than a Muslim one, until the end of the 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=82}}</ref>\n\nThe Islam they practised had a significant foundation in the culture of the Bengali countryside.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=82\u201383}}</ref> The elite Muslims identified themselves as ashraf (of foreign descent) and sought to copy North Indian Islamic culture and they saw themselves as the protectors of the true Islam in Bengal. To them, the Islam practised by the local peasants and craftsmen was contaminated by un-Islamic associations.

The Hindu elite regarded the countryside Muslims as British agents and inferior. To Muslims, the Hindus were cunning exploiters.

Abdul Momen Khan, who was governor in the 1962-1968 period, persecuted opposition and censored media. The regime became more unpopular during 1965, in the year of a war between India and Pakistan.

He ended the one unit scheme\nand permitted popular representation, thereby allowing East Pakistan 162 of the 300 seats. Yahya created a legal framework order (LFO) as a guideline for the assembly. It stipulated principles such as the federalism of the state, paramountcy of Islam, provincial autonomy with sufficient provisions for the federal government to carry out its duties and defend the country's integrity. The latter point clashed with Mujib's points. Yahya highlighted that a constitution would not be accepted if it did not adhere to the LFO.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was announced to be the Head of the State. [[Tajuddin Ahmed]] became the Prime Minister, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] became the acting President and [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed]] the Foreign Minister. There the war plan was sketched out with Bangladesh armed forces established and named \"Muktifoujo\". Later these forces were named \"Muktibahini\" (freedom fighters). [[M. A. G. Osmani]] was appointed as the Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nFor military purposes, Bangladesh was divided into 11 sectors under 11 sector commanders. In addition to these sectors, later in the war, three special forces were formed: Z Force, S Force and K Force. These three forces' names were derived from the initial letters of the commander's name. The training and most of the arms and ammunitions were arranged by the Meherpur government which was supported by India. As fighting grew between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali [[Mukti Bahini]], an estimated ten million Bengalis, mainly Hindus, sought refuge in the Indian states of [[Assam]], Tripura and [[West Bengal]].\n\nThe freedom fighters were not able to beat the military.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 129\"/> The Pakistani military created civilian and paramilitary groups to neutralise the freedom fighters.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=167}}</ref> They recruited Biharis and Bengalis who did not support the separation of East Pakistan.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 88\">{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=88|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became clear that neither the Pakistani military nor the freedom fighters could win, India gradually started its invasion.

India seized its opportunity to declare war when Pakistan raided Indian airfields on 3 December. The Indian military and Mukti Bahini had the edge with better weaponry, complete air and naval supremacy and support from most locals. The Pakistani army fought ferociously and many were killed.

There was an insurgency by the radical socialist [[Jashod]], as well as agitation by pro-business and conservative forces, who felt the Awami League was unfairly taking exclusive credit for the liberation struggle.

Zia formed the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Parliamentary elections were held in 1979, in which the BNP gained a landslide majority and the Awami League became the principal opposition party.\n\nPresident Zia restored [[free market]]s, redefined socialism as \"economic and social justice\" in the constitution and crafted a foreign policy which emphasised solidarity with Muslim majority countries and [[SAARC|regional co-operation in South Asia]]. Bangladesh achieved rapid economic and industrial growth under Zia's presidency. The government built the country's first [[export processing zone]]s. It operated a popular food-for-work programme, reversed the collectivisation of farms and promoted private sector development.\n\nBangladesh's growing [[anti-communist]] profile saw President Zia strongly opposing the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].\n\nZia faced twenty one attempted coups against his government, including one by the air force.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, Anthony 1986\"/> His one time ally Colonel Abu Taher was tried for treason and executed. Similar fates were met by many of his perceived rivals in the armed forces. However, the final coup attempt resulted in his [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassination in 1981]]. Zia was killed by troops loyal to Major General [[Abul Manzoor]] who stormed his official residence in Chittagong on 30 May 1981.

F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]]. Lieutenant General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] proclaimed martial law and became the [[Chief Martial Law Administrator#Bangladesh|Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. He appointed himself as the President of the Council of Ministers and the naval and air force chiefs as deputy martial law administrators. Ershad geared Bangladesh's foreign policy more towards the anti-Soviet bloc.\n\nIn 1983, Ershad assumed the presidency. Political repression was rife under Ershad's martial law regime. However, the government implemented a series of administrative reforms, particularly in terms of [[devolution]]. The eighteen districts of the country were divided into [[Districts of Bangladesh|sixty four districts]]. The [[upazila]] system was also created.\n\nAmong his major actions were to privatise the largely state-owned economy (up to 70% of industry was in public ownership) and encourage private investment in heavy industries along with light manufacturing, raw materials, and newspapers. Foreign companies were invited to invest in Bangladeshi industry as well, and stiff protectionist measures were put in place to safeguard manufacturing. All political parties and trade unions were banned for the time being, with the death penalty to be administered for corruption and political agitation. Ershad's takeover was generally viewed as a positive development, as Bangladesh was in a state of serious economic difficulty. The country was facing significant food shortages. The government also faced a severe budget deficit to the tune of 4&nbsp;billion takas, and the [[IMF]] declared that it would not provide any more loans until Bangladesh paid down some of its existing debts. During most of 1984, Ershad sought the opposition parties' participation in local elections under martial law. The opposition's refusal to participate, however, forced Ershad to abandon these plans. Ershad sought public support for his regime in a national referendum on his leadership in [[1985 Bangladeshi military rule referendum|March 1985]]. He won overwhelmingly, although turnout was small. Two months later, Ershad held elections for local council chairmen.

The local council elections were generally considered by international observers to have been less violent and more free and fair than previous elections. However, opposition to Ershad's rule began to regain momentum, escalating by the end of 1990 in frequent general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order.<ref name=bn/>\n\n===Return of parliamentary republic and Battle of the Begums===\n====First caretaker government (1990\u20131991)====\n{{Main|1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh}}\nErshad resigned under the pressure from the military and international community, as the [[pro-democracy]] movement spearheaded by Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina engulfed the entire country and drew the participation of the middle and upper classes.\n\nThe chief justice, [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]], was sworn in as [[acting president]] and formed the first [[caretaker government of Bangladesh]].

However, they formed a government with support from the Islamic party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]], with [[Khaleda Zia]], widow of Ziaur Rahman, obtaining the post of prime minister. Only four parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1991 Parliament: The BNP, led by Prime Minister [[Begum Khaleda Zia]]; the AL, led by Sheikh Hasina; the Jamaat-I-Islami (JI), led by Ghulam Azam; and the Jatiya Party (JP), led by acting chairman Mizanur Rahman Choudhury while its founder, former President Ershad, served out a prison sentence on corruption charges. Khaleda Zia became the first female prime minister in Bangladeshi history.\n\nIn [[1991 Bangladeshi constitutional referendum|September 1991]] a constitutional referendum was held, which sought the transfer of executive powers from the President, which had been held by the Office since 1975, to the Prime Minister \u2014 making the President largely a ceremonial role. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the constitutional amendment and Bangladesh was restored to a Parliamentary democracy, as per its founding constitution. In October 1991, members of Parliament elected a new head of state, President [[Abdur Rahman Biswas]].Finance Minister [[Saifur Rahman (politician)|Saifur Rahman]] launched a series of liberal economic reforms, which set a precedent in South Asia and was seen as a model in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.<ref name=\"dhakatribune\">\n{{cite news |last=Hossain |first=Kazi Liakat |date=6 September 2016 |title=Remembering the budget wizard |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/06/remembering-budget-wizard/ |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |type=Op-ed |access-date=6 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510083610/http://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/06/remembering-budget-wizard/ |archive-date=10 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nIn March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the opposition claimed the government had rigged, led to an indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a programme of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament.

During this period, President [[Abdur Rahman Biswas]] sacked army chief Lieutenant General [[Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim]] for alleged political activities, causing the general mount an abortive coup. The sacked army chief ordered troops in Bogra, Mymensingh and Jessore to march towards Dhaka. However, the military commander of Savar sided with the president and deployed tanks in the capital and its surrounding highways, and also suspended ferry services, as part of operations to deter the coup forces. Lt Gen Nasim was later arrested in Dhaka Cantonment.\n{{Further|1996 Bangladesh coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n\nThe Chief Advisor successfully held free and fair elections on 12 June 1996. The Awami League emerged as the single largest party, with 146 seats in parliament, followed by the BNP with 116 seats and Jatiya Party with 32 seats.\n\n====Hasina administration (1996\u20132001)====\n[[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina's]] Awami League won 146 of 300 seats in the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|June 1996 elections]], just short of a majority. However, with the support of Jatiya party she formed what she called a \"Government of National Consensus\" in June 1996, which included one minister from the Jatiya Party and another from the Jatiyo Samajtantric Dal, a very small leftist party. The Jatiya Party never entered into a formal coalition arrangement, and party president H.M. Ershad withdrew his support from the government in September 1997. Only three parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1996 Parliament: the Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party. Jatiya Party president, Ershad, was released from prison on bail in January 1997.<ref name=bn/>\nInternational and domestic election observers found the June 1996 election free and fair, and ultimately, the BNP party decided to join the new Parliament. The BNP soon charged that police and Awami League activists were engaged in large-scale harassment and jailing of opposition activists. At the end of 1996, the BNP staged a parliamentary walkout over this and other grievances but returned in January 1997 under a four-point agreement with the ruling party. The BNP asserted that this agreement was never implemented and later staged another walkout in August 1997. The BNP returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe first Hasina administration is credited for landmark initiatives in environmental and inter-ethnic peacemaking. It was responsible for signing the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with India and the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] with ethnic insurgents, for which Hasina won the UNESCO Peace Prize. Hasina was also one of the founding leaders of the [[Developing 8 Countries]]. In 1998, Hasina hosted a rare and unprecedented trilateral economic summit in Dhaka with Prime Ministers [[Nawaz Sharif]] of Pakistan and [[I. K. Gujral]] of India. Her summits with US President [[Bill Clinton]] in Dhaka and Washington DC focused on American energy investments for Bangladesh's [[Natural gas in Bangladesh|natural gas reserves]] and the extradition of her father's killers.

Opposition parties staged an increasing number of nationwide general strikes, rising from six days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn July 2001, the Awami League government stepped down to allow a caretaker government to preside over parliamentary elections. Political violence that had increased during the Awami League government's tenure continued to increase through the summer in the run up to the election. In August, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina agreed during a visit of former President Jimmy Carter to respect the results of the election, join Parliament win or lose, forswear the use of hartals (violently enforced strikes) as political tools, and if successful in forming a government allow for a more meaningful role for the opposition in Parliament.\n\n====Third caretaker government (2001)====\nThe caretaker government, led by Chief Advisor [[Latifur Rahman]], was successful in containing the violence, which allowed a parliamentary general election to be successfully held on [[2001 Bangladeshi general election|1 October 2001]]. The election saw a landslide victory of the BNP-led coalition, which included the far-right [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Islami Oikya Jote]].

In June 2004, the AL returned to Parliament without having any of their demands met. They then attended Parliament irregularly before announcing a boycott of the entire June 2005 budget session.\n\nKhaleda Zia's administration was marked by improved economic growth, corruption allegations and growing rifts between the country's secular and conservative forces.

Later, Muslim rulers initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded by king [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the [[White people|Europeans]] to as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

A major part of this geography lasted till historical times. The loss of the jungle was due to human activity. Bengal had an early human presence. But there is no consensus for the timeframe of the first human activity in Bengal nor are there plenty of remains. One view contends that humans entered Bengal from China 60,000 years ago.

Industries of fossilwood manufacturing blades, scrapers and axes have been discovered in Lalmai, Sitakund and Chaklapunji. These have been connected with similar findings in Burma and West Bengal. Large stones, thought to be prehistoric, were constructed in north eastern Bangladesh and are similar to those in India's nearby hills. Farming was practised before the first millennium BCE.

In 326&nbsp;BCE, with the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]] the region again came to prominence. The Greek and Latin historians suggested that Alexander the Great withdrew from India anticipating the valiant counter-attack of the mighty [[Gangaridai]] empire that was located in the Bengal region. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]], was convinced that it was better to return. [[Diodorus Siculus]] mentions Gangaridai to be the most powerful empire in India whose king possessed an army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war. The allied forces of Gangaridai Empire and [[Nanda Empire]] (Prasii) were preparing a massive counter-attack against the forces of Alexander on the banks of Ganges.

Little is known of the period after that although parts of Bengal were probably under the Pataliputra-based Sunga dynasty. During this time Pundra was still a significant Buddhist location. Local rulers retained power while paying tribute to the Gupta Empire in the 300s and 400s. The Bengal delta became the kingdom of Samatata; its hub near the contemporary Chandpur. A Gupta inscription indicates that the Gupta empire possessed influence in Samatata without ruling it directly. Bengal remained a frontier despite its rare associations with the Indian heartland. Several dynasties changed during the next few centuries. While not much information is available about them, plates and other forms of evidence obtained from the Comilla district indicate that Gopachandra ruled the area in the early 500s. The Khargas became rulers in the next century.

Gaur was ruled by Sasanka in the early 600s. He was based in Karnasuvarna in modern-day Murshidabad district. Contemporary Chinese reports and coinage suggest that he was a firm Shaivite who was vehemently opposed to Buddhism. Opposition to Buddhism and a commitment to Brahminism apparently continued under the Sura dynasty, founded by Adisura around 700 CE. Around the middle of the eighth century a firm Buddhist, Gopala, assumed power in Bengal, possibly supported by Buddhist chiefs who were opposed to the effects of the Suras and Sasanka's faithful Brahmanism.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 13\u20134\"/>\n\n=== Gauda Kingdom ===\n{{main|Gauda Kingdom}}\nBy the 6th century, the [[Gupta Empire]], which ruled over the northern Indian subcontinent had largely broken up. [[East Bengal|Eastern Bengal]] splintered into the kingdoms of Vanga, [[Samatata]] and [[Harikela]] while the [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]] kings rose in the west with their capital at [[Karnasuvarna]] (near modern [[Murshidabad]]). [[Shashanka]], a vassal of the last Gupta Emperor proclaimed independence and unified the smaller principalities of Bengal (Gaur, Vanga, Samatata). He vied for regional power with [[Harshavardhana]] in northern India after treacherously murdering Harsha's elder brother Rajyavardhana. Harsha's continuous pressure led to the gradual weakening of the Gauda kingdom founded by Shashanka and finally ended with his death.

Initially, Bengal was administered by the Delhi Sultanate's governors, then by independent sultanates and then was under the rule of the Mughal empire. While Muslims had advanced into Sindh in the 700s, it was in Afghanistan that the ultimate Muslim conquest of South Asia originated from, starting with the raids by Mahmud of Ghazni in the early 11th century. The Afghanistan-based Ghurids replaced the Ghaznavids and they started expanded into the Ganges region. As part of this eastward expansion Ikhtiyaruddin Muhammad Bakhtiar Khan defeated the Palas in Bihar and in 1202 was victorious over the Senas in Nadia. In 1206 the Delhi Sultanate was created. It was not a true dynasty but the rulers was known as Mamluk. The Sultanate continued till 1290. The conquest of Nadia did not entail swift conversions to Islam.

Shamsuddin drove up the Ganges to contest Tughluq rule. The Tughluqs, in return drove Ilyas Shah out of Pandua into eastern Bengal. Shamsuddin reclaimed Pandua and continued ruling Bengal.

The Mughals asserted a centralised form of rule on top of the differing local administrative structures. Consequently, local rulers administered control in the rural areas. These \"zamindars\" were autonomous and were a secular elite,<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=51}}</ref> differentiated from the general populace by their authority.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=51\u201352}}</ref> Surnames in modern Bangladesh such as Chowdhury, Khan, Sarkar and Talukdar originate from the names of ranks in the Mughal elite.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 52\"/> This elite functioned alongside the Mughal officials. The latter's duty was to keep charge over tax collection. The diwan was the most important tax officer and was directly selected by the Mughal ruler. Each Mughal conquest in Bengal was accompanied with the establishment of a thana (garrison) for the purpose of maintaining peace. After that the territory would be merged into the empire's administrative system. In the empire's system each province would comprise several regions, called \"sarkar\", which in turn would be made up of subdivisions called parganas. The lowest tier in the system was the mouza (revenue village).<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 52\"/>\n\nThe agricultural borderland during Mughal rule in the 1500s started moving towards the eastern portion of Bengal. The region's agricultural productivity increased. To increase their revenues the Mughal administration promoted forest clearing and wet-rice farming. The officials gave land grants to entrepreneurs who were willing to give taxes in exchange for rights over the lands. The colonists required labour and this was advantageous for the religious elite.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 30\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=30}}</ref> Most communities in the region were boatmen and fishermen on the margins of society who were nominally Hindu but in reality had very weak ties to Hinduism.

Society was ordered around the shrine. New communities would engage in forest clearing and cultivation. Locals either merged with these communities or moved away while keeping trading contacts with the rice cultivators.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 30\"/>\n\nThe Mughal government had no attitude of encouraging Islam in the region and Hindus made up many of these pioneers who had government backing. But most of the pioneers were Muslim. A large number of them were pirs. Richard Eaton asserts that Islam was understood to be linked with the government-accepted acquisition of land in eastern Bengal which had only weak connections with Hindu civilization. The traditions and rituals of eastern Bengal, mosques and shrines blended together. Islam spread in Bengal because of its localisation. Islamic agencies were inserted into the contemporary cosmology, were then associated with local divinities and eventually the Islamic agencies took over the local culture.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 30\"/> Local Hindus, in response to the conversion, closed ranks and became more conservative, expelling those who were 'polluted' by contact with Muslims.

The Portuguese traded and proselytised until 1632 when they were expelled by Shah Jahan, who allowed them to re-enter in the next year. The hostility towards them was a consequence of piracy by the Portuguese and Maghs. By 1651 the British obtained control of Hooghly.

A Dutch station was established at Chinsura but the Dutch directed their interests to Ceylon and Southeast Asia. In 1825 they exchanged Chinsura with the British for posts in Southeast Asia. In 1755 a Danish station was established at Serampore. In 1845 the British bought it. The French Company lasted longer. Their position was second to the British. The latter overtook the French.

In 1681 a \"presidency\" was established. In 1690 Job Charnock established [[Calcutta]]. During this time the British came into conflict with Bengal's Mughal governors. In 1652 the British had been exempted from customs payments in exchange for giving yearly sums to the nawab. But the nawab foisted fees upon them, which the British opposed. The British met the nawab Shaista Khan in Dhaka in 1652 and secured the exemption again.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 25\">{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref>\n\nBritish trading activities expanded during Shaista Khan's administration. Alivardi Khan disliked the British and French plans to secure their possessions. Alivardi Khan disputed the British application of Emperor Fakukhsiyar's order which had allowed the British unfettered trading privileges in the Mughal empire. Alivardi Khan was perturbed by the stipulation in the order which provided the British with tax exemptions on the transportation of goods. This meant lower revenues for Alivardi Khan.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 25\"/>\n\nAlivardi's successor Sirajuddaulah set about eliminating the foreign presence. In 1756 he seized Calcutta and incarcerated the resident British population. Robert Clive and his troops took Calcutta back in January 1757. Clive compelled Sirajuddaulah to assent to a treaty which would restore Emperor Fakukhsiyar's order allowing the British to trade unrestricted. Clive then conspired with Sirajuddaulah's relative, Mir Jafar, and obtained the support of a major banker, Jagat Seth. Robert Clive and Sirajuddaulah's troops battled each other at Plassey in June 1757.

In 1790 the British introduced \"permanent settlement\" and made it law three years later. It was a framework for taxation on land. The system was the core of the colonial form of government. It was an agreement between the British and the zamindars who were effectively given landholdings in exchange for timely payment of taxes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe aim of the permanent settlement was that the zamindars would eventually invest in the development of agriculture and improve the economy of Bengal. The aim did not materialise because the zamindars did not have state backing for agrarian growth and because of newfound ways of generating wealth. A common method was fleecing the peasants. The increasingly rich zamindars moved away from agrarian and taxation activities. They appointed intermediaries. A multilayered form of landholdings developed, which benefited from the land's revenue. This structure was most pronounced in the southern areas of modern Bangladesh. The permanent settlement scheme deprived peasants of any proprietary rights over the land.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=59}}</ref>\n\nWhile Muslims had comprised most of the landlord class during Mughal rule, Hindus became prominent during the colonial rule. While Muslim landlords and Hindu occupants did exist, eastern Bengal witnessed an amalgamation of religion with class, with Hindu landlords presiding over mainly Muslim peasants. Hindu landlords were also prominent in western Bengal, but most peasants there were Hindus. This factor would become politically important by the end of the colonial rule.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 60\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=60}}</ref>\n\nAnother change during British rule was the system of cash cropping. During colonial rule cash cropping was organised and produced for international markets. It was significant because of the links it created between the Bengali countryside's economy with markets in Asia and Europe.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 60\"/> Because of cash cropping the eastern region of modern Bangladesh emerged as the centre for jute cultivation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=60\u201363}}</ref> The western portion of modern Bangladesh produced silk and sugar. The northern areas produced tobacco. Crops were associated with specific types of land organisation. Peasantry in the eastern areas were compelled by financial needs towards market production. The countryside's elite in the western and northern areas were protected from the immediate impact of market factors because they provided agrarian credit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=63}}</ref>\n\nThe British abandoned the former official language, Persian, in the 1830s and English medum educational institutions prepared a small part of the Bengali elite for jobs in the lower and middle tiers of government.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=64}}</ref> Muslims took up the British improvements more slowly and lagged behind the Hindus educationally and commercially.

The population growth during colonial rule was because people had more knowledge of hygiene and increased access to hospitals and medication. Transport became less reliant on the rivers with the construction of bridges and railways. Improvements in technology aided communications. Despite the government's authoritarian form, the British tried out limited democratic systems in the later part of their rule due to political constraints.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\"/>\n\nA vital development under British rule was the rise of Calcutta to political and cultural prominence.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 64\"/> It became colonial India's capital. From 1757 to 1931 the Government of India was located in the city. Aspiring Bengalis migrated to Calcutta and obtained education and government employment. They are known to historians as the \"bhodrolok\" and high caste Hindus comprised most of them.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=65}}</ref> Old centers such as Dhaka and Murshidabad declined while the trading class became concentrated in Calcutta.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 29\"/>\n\nThe authoritarian regime functioning in alliance with the rural elite was susceptible to resistance and revolts happened frequently during the British rule. However, British rule in Bengal faced no threat by the second half of the 1800s. Bengal did not participate in the 1857 revolt which nearly ended British administration over large swathes of India. While there was a revolt by troops in Chittagong it dwindled because the landlords and peasants did not support the rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=77}}</ref> Instead political grievances nor revolved around peasant rights and the commercialization of agriculture. The struggle was usually characterised by peasants and the middle class in opposition to the landlords, Western businessmen and the British administration. Many campaigns eventually ended the indigo industry. These were led by Wahhabi influenced Islamic missionaries.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=78}}</ref>\n\nThere had been prominent Hindu reformist movements in the early 1800s but no equivalent Muslim movement. A departure from this rule was the Faraizi movement which Haji Shariatullah started in 1828. It was a conservative Islamic movement grounded in Wahhabi ideology. It opposed the exaltation of saints and the repression by landlords and indigo traders. Shariatullah regarded India as a dar al-harb and thus believed that festivals and Friday prayers should cease. His heir, Dudu Mia, expanded the movement and claimed that the landlords did not possess permanent land rights. The Faraizi movement eventually ended after his demise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=30|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref>\n\nTitu Mir led another Wahhabi campaign at the same time as the Faraizi movement. This movement was violent and opposed to the British presence. He died in 1831 during a confrontation with the British. Two years later his followers supported indigo farmers in a clash against the European planters and Hindu landlords. The protest was ultimately muted by 1860 when the peasants were granted more security.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=31|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref> But not all rural rebellions were inspired by religion.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\"/>\n\nBy the late 1800s parts of the elite and peasants became politically connected. This link was to become a crucial prototype of later campaigns in Bengal. The movement for self determination joined communist and nationalist movements, several of which were associated with all-India organisations.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 78\"/>\n\n===Bengal renaissance===\n{{Main|Bengal renaissance}}\n{|  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Bengal renaissance\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nImage:Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] is Asia's first [[Nobel laureate]] and composer of the national anthem of Bangladesh.\nimage:Nazrul.jpg|[[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], the [[national poet]] of Bangladesh.\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe [[Bengal renaissance]] refers to a social reform movement during the 19th and early 20th centuries in Bengal.

The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \"Bengal\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of [[Bihar and Orissa]]) and [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] with [[Dacca]] as the capital of the latter.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gilmour  |first=David |year=1994 |title=Curzon: Imperial Statesman |publisher=John Murray |pages=271\u20133 |isbn=978-0-7195-4834-5}}</ref>  Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities.

The second reason was that the initial enthusiasm of some Bengali Muslims for the protest against the partition diminished because of the protest's culture. The predominantly Hindu bhodrolok led the anti-partition campaign and connected it with Hindu revivalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=81}}</ref> They identified their homeland with Kali and selected Bande Mataram as anthem, which Muslims opposed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> The third reason was that Bengal's Muslims identified themselves as members of a community. The British had promoted religion as a grounds for political identification. This had been difficult because the Muslims of Bengal had not perceived themselves as a separate community. Muslim unity had been hindered by significant internal differences. Most Bengali Muslims had been more a member of a religiously diverse Bengali community than a Muslim one, until the end of the 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=82}}</ref>\n\nThe Islam they practised had a significant foundation in the culture of the Bengali countryside.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|pages=82\u201383}}</ref> The elite Muslims identified themselves as ashraf (of foreign descent) and sought to copy North Indian Islamic culture and they saw themselves as the protectors of the true Islam in Bengal.

Bengali participation in the military was very low. The British preferred to recruit Punjabi Muslims. The Punjabis dominated the army Pakistan inherited from British India's military.

Abdul Momen Khan, who was governor in the 1962-1968 period, persecuted opposition and censored media. The regime became more unpopular during 1965, in the year of a war between India and Pakistan. Patriotism was high in East Pakistan during the war against India, but this was one of the last cases of national solidarity. East Pakistanis felt they had not been protected by the army from a possible Indian invasion.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 121\">{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=121}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the leader of the Awami League, proclaimed a 6-point plan titled ''Our Charter of Survival'' at a national conference of opposition political parties at Lahore, in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani federation with a weak central government. This led to the historic [[Six point movement]].

He ended the one unit scheme\nand permitted popular representation, thereby allowing East Pakistan 162 of the 300 seats. Yahya created a legal framework order (LFO) as a guideline for the assembly. It stipulated principles such as the federalism of the state, paramountcy of Islam, provincial autonomy with sufficient provisions for the federal government to carry out its duties and defend the country's integrity. The latter point clashed with Mujib's points. Yahya highlighted that a constitution would not be accepted if it did not adhere to the LFO. Mujib's party had drafted its own constitution based on six points.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 78\">{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|page=78|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref>\n\n===Independence movement===\n{{main|Bangladesh Liberation War}}\n160 of East Pakistan's 162 seats were captured by the Awami League.<ref name=\"Baxter 1997 78\"/> Nurul Amin won one of the remaining seats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Craig|year=1997|title=Bangladesh: From A Nation To A State |publisher=Westview Press|pages=78\u201379|isbn=978-0-813-33632-9}}</ref> Bhutto won most West Pakistani seats.

The West Pakistani government deployed soldiers to deter such a possibility.<ref name=\"Willem van Schendel 125\"/> Mujib chose a middle-ground option by starting a [[Nonviolent resistance|non-cooperation movement]]. The movement was successful, freezing the machinery of government and effectively giving Mujib command over East Pakistan. Mujib announced that East Pakistanis would fight for independence but he simultaneously attempted to achieve a solution within a united Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book|author=Willem van Schendel|title=A History of Bangladesh|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511997419|page=126}}</ref>\n\nYahya Khan went to Dhaka in the middle of March as a last attempt to obtain a resolution. Bhutto joined him. However, the three parties could not arrive at a consensus on the transfer of power. Yahya was willing to accept the Six Points and its demand for autonomy and also agreed to Mujib becoming prime minister. However, for Bhutto this was treachery to East Pakistan. On 23 March the Awami League told Yahya that he was to issue regional autonomy within 2 days or East Pakistan would turn lawless.

In addition to these sectors, later in the war, three special forces were formed: Z Force, S Force and K Force.

Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] became the 2nd [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] on 12 January 1972 and is widely regarded as the nation's independence hero and [[founding father]]. [[Nation-building]] under his regime was based on secular Bengali nationalist principles.

There was an insurgency by the radical socialist [[Jashod]], as well as agitation by pro-business and conservative forces, who felt the Awami League was unfairly taking exclusive credit for the liberation struggle.

Zia formed the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Parliamentary elections were held in 1979, in which the BNP gained a landslide majority and the Awami League became the principal opposition party.\n\nPresident Zia restored [[free market]]s, redefined socialism as \"economic and social justice\" in the constitution and crafted a foreign policy which emphasised solidarity with Muslim majority countries and [[SAARC|regional co-operation in South Asia]]. Bangladesh achieved rapid economic and industrial growth under Zia's presidency. The government built the country's first [[export processing zone]]s. It operated a popular food-for-work programme, reversed the collectivisation of farms and promoted private sector development.\n\nBangladesh's growing [[anti-communist]] profile saw President Zia strongly opposing the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].\n\nZia faced twenty one attempted coups against his government, including one by the air force.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, Anthony 1986\"/> His one time ally Colonel Abu Taher was tried for treason and executed. Similar fates were met by many of his perceived rivals in the armed forces. However, the final coup attempt resulted in his [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassination in 1981]].

F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]]. Lieutenant General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] proclaimed martial law and became the [[Chief Martial Law Administrator#Bangladesh|Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. He appointed himself as the President of the Council of Ministers and the naval and air force chiefs as deputy martial law administrators. Ershad geared Bangladesh's foreign policy more towards the anti-Soviet bloc.\n\nIn 1983, Ershad assumed the presidency. Political repression was rife under Ershad's martial law regime. However, the government implemented a series of administrative reforms, particularly in terms of [[devolution]]. The eighteen districts of the country were divided into [[Districts of Bangladesh|sixty four districts]]. The [[upazila]] system was also created.\n\nAmong his major actions were to privatise the largely state-owned economy (up to 70% of industry was in public ownership) and encourage private investment in heavy industries along with light manufacturing, raw materials, and newspapers. Foreign companies were invited to invest in Bangladeshi industry as well, and stiff protectionist measures were put in place to safeguard manufacturing. All political parties and trade unions were banned for the time being, with the death penalty to be administered for corruption and political agitation. Ershad's takeover was generally viewed as a positive development, as Bangladesh was in a state of serious economic difficulty. The country was facing significant food shortages. The government also faced a severe budget deficit to the tune of 4&nbsp;billion takas, and the [[IMF]] declared that it would not provide any more loans until Bangladesh paid down some of its existing debts. During most of 1984, Ershad sought the opposition parties' participation in local elections under martial law. The opposition's refusal to participate, however, forced Ershad to abandon these plans. Ershad sought public support for his regime in a national referendum on his leadership in [[1985 Bangladeshi military rule referendum|March 1985]]. He won overwhelmingly, although turnout was small. Two months later, Ershad held elections for local council chairmen. Pro-government candidates won a majority of the posts, setting in motion the President's ambitious decentralisation programme.\nPolitical life was further liberalised in early 1986, and additional political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya (National) Party]], designed as Ershad's political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established.<ref name=bn>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm |title=Background Note: Bangladesh |last=[[Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs]] |date=March 2008 |website=U.S. Department of State |access-date=11 June 2008 }} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> Despite a boycott by the BNP, led by President Zia's widow, Begum [[Khaleda Zia]], parliamentary elections were held on schedule in [[1986 Bangladeshi general election|May 1986]].

However, opposition to Ershad's rule began to regain momentum, escalating by the end of 1990 in frequent general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order.<ref name=bn/>\n\n===Return of parliamentary republic and Battle of the Begums===\n====First caretaker government (1990\u20131991)====\n{{Main|1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh}}\nErshad resigned under the pressure from the military and international community, as the [[pro-democracy]] movement spearheaded by Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina engulfed the entire country and drew the participation of the middle and upper classes.\n\nThe chief justice, [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]], was sworn in as [[acting president]] and formed the first [[caretaker government of Bangladesh]]. Ahmed placed Ershad under arrest and organised free and fair elections in 1991.\n\n====Khaleda administration (1991\u20131996)====\nThe centre-right BNP won the [[1991 Bangladeshi general election]] with 140 seats, but was short of an overall parliamentary majority. However, they formed a government with support from the Islamic party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]], with [[Khaleda Zia]], widow of Ziaur Rahman, obtaining the post of prime minister. Only four parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1991 Parliament: The BNP, led by Prime Minister [[Begum Khaleda Zia]]; the AL, led by Sheikh Hasina; the Jamaat-I-Islami (JI), led by Ghulam Azam; and the Jatiya Party (JP), led by acting chairman Mizanur Rahman Choudhury while its founder, former President Ershad, served out a prison sentence on corruption charges. Khaleda Zia became the first female prime minister in Bangladeshi history.\n\nIn [[1991 Bangladeshi constitutional referendum|September 1991]] a constitutional referendum was held, which sought the transfer of executive powers from the President, which had been held by the Office since 1975, to the Prime Minister \u2014 making the President largely a ceremonial role. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the constitutional amendment and Bangladesh was restored to a Parliamentary democracy, as per its founding constitution. In October 1991, members of Parliament elected a new head of state, President [[Abdur Rahman Biswas]].Finance Minister [[Saifur Rahman (politician)|Saifur Rahman]] launched a series of liberal economic reforms, which set a precedent in South Asia and was seen as a model in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.<ref name=\"dhakatribune\">\n{{cite news |last=Hossain |first=Kazi Liakat |date=6 September 2016 |title=Remembering the budget wizard |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/06/remembering-budget-wizard/ |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |type=Op-ed |access-date=6 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510083610/http://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2016/09/06/remembering-budget-wizard/ |archive-date=10 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nIn March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the opposition claimed the government had rigged, led to an indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a programme of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament.

During this period, President [[Abdur Rahman Biswas]] sacked army chief Lieutenant General [[Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim]] for alleged political activities, causing the general mount an abortive coup. The sacked army chief ordered troops in Bogra, Mymensingh and Jessore to march towards Dhaka. However, the military commander of Savar sided with the president and deployed tanks in the capital and its surrounding highways, and also suspended ferry services, as part of operations to deter the coup forces. Lt Gen Nasim was later arrested in Dhaka Cantonment.\n{{Further|1996 Bangladesh coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n\nThe Chief Advisor successfully held free and fair elections on 12 June 1996. The Awami League emerged as the single largest party, with 146 seats in parliament, followed by the BNP with 116 seats and Jatiya Party with 32 seats.\n\n====Hasina administration (1996\u20132001)====\n[[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina's]] Awami League won 146 of 300 seats in the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|June 1996 elections]], just short of a majority. However, with the support of Jatiya party she formed what she called a \"Government of National Consensus\" in June 1996, which included one minister from the Jatiya Party and another from the Jatiyo Samajtantric Dal, a very small leftist party. The Jatiya Party never entered into a formal coalition arrangement, and party president H.M. Ershad withdrew his support from the government in September 1997. Only three parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1996 Parliament: the Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party. Jatiya Party president, Ershad, was released from prison on bail in January 1997.<ref name=bn/>\nInternational and domestic election observers found the June 1996 election free and fair, and ultimately, the BNP party decided to join the new Parliament. The BNP soon charged that police and Awami League activists were engaged in large-scale harassment and jailing of opposition activists. At the end of 1996, the BNP staged a parliamentary walkout over this and other grievances but returned in January 1997 under a four-point agreement with the ruling party. The BNP asserted that this agreement was never implemented and later staged another walkout in August 1997. The BNP returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe first Hasina administration is credited for landmark initiatives in environmental and inter-ethnic peacemaking. It was responsible for signing the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with India and the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] with ethnic insurgents, for which Hasina won the UNESCO Peace Prize. Hasina was also one of the founding leaders of the [[Developing 8 Countries]]. In 1998, Hasina hosted a rare and unprecedented trilateral economic summit in Dhaka with Prime Ministers [[Nawaz Sharif]] of Pakistan and [[I. K. Gujral]] of India. Her summits with US President [[Bill Clinton]] in Dhaka and Washington DC focused on American energy investments for Bangladesh's [[Natural gas in Bangladesh|natural gas reserves]] and the extradition of her father's killers.

Opposition parties staged an increasing number of nationwide general strikes, rising from six days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn July 2001, the Awami League government stepped down to allow a caretaker government to preside over parliamentary elections. Political violence that had increased during the Awami League government's tenure continued to increase through the summer in the run up to the election. In August, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina agreed during a visit of former President Jimmy Carter to respect the results of the election, join Parliament win or lose, forswear the use of hartals (violently enforced strikes) as political tools, and if successful in forming a government allow for a more meaningful role for the opposition in Parliament.\n\n====Third caretaker government (2001)====\nThe caretaker government, led by Chief Advisor [[Latifur Rahman]], was successful in containing the violence, which allowed a parliamentary general election to be successfully held on [[2001 Bangladeshi general election|1 October 2001]]. The election saw a landslide victory of the BNP-led coalition, which included the far-right [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Islami Oikya Jote]].
