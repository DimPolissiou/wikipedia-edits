For instance, using a specific alternative page name might indicate that a specific type of link was intended.\n\nProviding information through a formal notation allows machines to calculate new facts (e.g. relations between pages) from the facts represented in the knowledge model.\n\n=== Semantic Web compatibility ===\n\nThe technologies developed by the [[Semantic Web]] community provide one basis for formal reasoning about the knowledge model that is developed by importing this data.  However, there is also a wide array of technologies that work on relational data.\n\n== Example ==\nImagine a semantic wiki devoted to [[food]]. The page for an [[apple]] would contain, in addition to standard text information, some machine-readable or at least machine-intuitable semantic data. The most basic kind of data would be that an apple is a kind of [[fruit]]\u2014what's known as an [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] relationship.  The wiki would thus be able to automatically generate a list of fruits, simply by listing all pages that are tagged as being of type \"fruit.\" Further semantic tags in the \"apple\" page could indicate other data about apples, including their possible colors and sizes, nutritional information and serving suggestions, and so on.\n\nIf the wiki exports all this data in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] or a similar format, it can then be queried in a similar way to a database\u2014so that an external user or site could, for instance, request a list of all fruits that are red and can also be baked in a pie.\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1980s, before the Web began, there were several technologies to process typed links between collectively maintained hypertext pages, such as [[NoteCards]], [[KMS (hypertext)|KMS]] and [[gIBIS]]. Extensive research was published on these tools by the [[collaboration software]], [[computer-mediated communication]], [[hypertext]], and [[computer supported cooperative work]] communities.\n\nThe first known usage of the term \"Semantic Wiki\" was a [[Usenet]] posting by Andy Dingley in January 2001.<ref>{{cite newsgroup\n  |title=Wikiwiki (was Theory: \"opportunistic hypertext\")\n  |author=Andy Dingley\n  |date=21 January 2001\n  |newsgroup=comp.infosystems.www.authoring.site-design\n  |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.site-design/msg/16465b2910d5faca?hl=en&\n}}</ref> Its first known appearance in a technical paper was in a 2003 paper by Austrian researcher Leo Sauermann.<ref>{{cite paper\n  | author = Leo Sauermann\n  | title = The Gnowsis-Using Semantic Web Technologies to build a Semantic Desktop\n  | publisher = Technical University of Vienna\n  | year = 2003\n  | url = http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~sauermann/papers/sauermann2003.pdf\n  | format = pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-06-20}}</ref>\n\nMany of the existing semantic wiki applications were started in the mid-2000s, including ArtificialMemory<ref>{{cite paper\n  | author = Dr. Lars Ludwig\n  | title = Extended Artificial Memory.

Some standalone semantic wiki applications exist, including  [[OntoWiki]]. Other semantic wiki software is structured as extensions or plugins to standard wiki software. The best-known of these is [[Semantic MediaWiki]], an extension to [[MediaWiki]]. Another example is the SemanticXWiki<ref>[http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Semantic+XWiki Semantic XWikiExtension], ObjectSecurity Ltd, November 16, 2012</ref> extension for [[XWiki]].\n\nSome standard wiki engines also include the ability to add typed, semantic links to pages, including [[PhpWiki]] and [[Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware]].\n\n[[Freebase (database)|Freebase]], though not billed as a wiki engine, is a web database with semantic-wiki-like properties.\n\n== Common features ==\nSemantic wikis vary in their degree of formalization.  Semantics may be either included in, or placed separately from, the wiki markup.  Users may be supported when adding this content, using forms or [[autocompletion]], or more complex proposal generation or consistency checks. The representation language may be wiki syntax, a standard language like [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] or [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], or some database directly populated by the tool that withdraws the semantics from the raw data. Separate versioning support or correction editing for the formalized content may also be provided. Provenance support for the formalized content, that is, tagging the author of the data separately from the data itself, varies.\n\nWhat data can get formalized also varies. One may be able to specify types for pages, categories or paragraphs or sentences (the latter features were more common in pre-web systems). Links are usually also typed. The source, property and target may be determined by some defaults, e.g. in Semantic MediaWiki the source is always the current page.\n\nReflexivity also varies.  More reflexive user interfaces provide strong ontology support from within the wiki, and allow it to be loaded, saved, created and changed.\n\nSome wikis inherit their ontology entirely from a pre-existing strong ontology like Cyc or [[SKOS]], while, on the other extreme, in other semantic wikis the entire ontology is generated by users.\n\nConventional, non-semantic wikis typically still have ways for users to express data and metadata, typically by tagging, categorizing and using [[namespace]]s. In semantic wikis, these features still typically exist, but integrated these with other semantic declarations, and sometimes with their use restricted.\n\nSome semantic wikis provide [[semantic reasoner|reasoning]] support, using a variety of engines. Such reasoning may require that all instance data comply with the ontologies.\n\nMost semantic wikis have simple querying support (such as searching for all triples with a certain subject, predicate, object), but the degree of advanced query support varies; some semantic wikis provide querying in standard languages like [[SPARQL]], while others instead provide a custom language. User interface support to construct these also varies.  Visualization of the links especially may be supported.\n\nMany semantic wikis can display the relationships between pages, or other data such as dates, geographical coordinates and number values, in various formats, such as graphs, tables, charts, calendars and maps.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Microformats]]\n* [[Ontology (computer science)|Ontology]]\n* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[RDFS]], [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], [[SPARQL]]\n* [[Business Intelligence 2.0]] (BI 2.0)\n*Software and websites:\n**[[Familypedia]]\n**[[Freebase (database)|Freebase]]\n**[[Gardenology.org]]\n**[[Math Images Project]]\n**[[Metavid]]\n**[[NeuroLex]]\n**[[OpenEI]]\n**[[SKYbrary]]\n**[[SNPedia]]\n**[[Bumblehood]]\n*[[Wikidata]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki Semantic wiki] article at [https://archive.is/20130113103558/http://semanticweb.org/wiki/ SemanticWeb.org]\n* [http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki_projects Semantic wiki projects] - contains a list of active, defunct and proposed semantic wiki applications\n* [http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SemanticWiki SemanticWiki mini-series] - a mini-series of online conferences about semantic wikis that ran in 2008 and 2009.\n\n{{Wiki topics}}\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Semantic wikis| ]]\n[[Category:Semantic wiki software]]\n[[Category:Wikis by genre]]\n", "text_old": "{{Semantics}}\nA '''semantic wiki''' is a [[wiki]] that has an underlying [[knowledge model|model of the knowledge]] described in its pages.
