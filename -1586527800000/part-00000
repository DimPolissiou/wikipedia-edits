[[Albano Laziale]] is situated some 15 kilometers from Rome, on the [[Appian Way]].\n\nIt has both a [[titular bishop]] and a [[diocesan bishop]].\n\n==Early history==\n\nIn the very year of his consulate, [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Acilius Glabrio]] was compelled by Domitian to fight, unarmed, in the amphitheatre at Albano, a Numidian bear, according to [[Juvenal]]:<ref>Juvenal, ''Satires'' IV, 99</ref> an enormous lion, according to [[Dio Cassius]].<ref>Cassius Dio Cocceianus, ''History of Rome'', LXVI, iii.</ref> This same Acilius Glabrio is later included in a Christian group of the Flavian family as a ''molitor rerum novarum''.<ref>Suetonius, \"Life of Domitian\", 10.</ref> The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' under the name Silvester<ref>{{cite book|editor=Louis Duchesne|title=Le Liber pontificalis: texte, introduction et commentaire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1Q-AAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume I, pars 1|year=1884|publisher=E. de Boccard|location=Paris|language=Latin|pages=184\u2013185}}</ref> says:\n\n:''fecit basilicam Augustus Constantinus in civitate Albanensis, videlicet S.

Under the basilica there was a [[crypt]], or ''confessio'', from which bodies were transferred to the cemetery nearby.\n\nThe foundation of the episcopal see of Albano is very probably contemporaneous with the erection of the Constantinian basilica. However, the first bishop of the see of whom we have any knowledge is Dionysius (d. 355). It is more than a century later (463) that we meet with another Bishop of Albano, Romanus. To these is to be added Ursinus, whose name is found on an inscription in the [[Catacomb of Domitilla]]. The consular date is either 345 or 395. The importance of this early Christian community is apparent from its cemetery, discovered in 1720 by [[Marangoni]]. It differs but little from the Christian cemeteries found in Rome. Its plan, clearly mapped out in the ''Epitome de locis ss. martyrum quae sunt foris civitatis Romae'', is considered by [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]] as the synopsis of an ancient description of the cemeteries, written before the end of the 6th century:\n\n:''per eandem vere viam (Appiam) pervenitur ad Albanam civitatem et per eandem civitatem ad ecclesiam S. Senatoris ubi et Perpetua jacet corpore et innumeri sancti et magna mirabilia ibidem geruntur.''\n\nThe saints here named are not known. [[Saint Senator of Albano]] is inserted without further explanation in the [[martyrology]] for 26 September (''et in Albano Senatoris''). From this he passed to the ''[[Roman martyrology]]'', where he is commemorated on the same day. But the first account of the martyrs of Albano is found in the ''[[Almanac of Philocalus]]'' (4th century) on 8 August:\n\n:''VI Idus aug. Carpophori, Victorini et Severiani, Albano, et Ostense septimo ballistaria, Cyriaci, Largi, Crescentiani, Memmiae, Julianae, et Smaragdi.''\n\nThe cemetery has frescoes, painted at various times by unknown artists, which show the progress of Christian art from the fourth to the 9th century.\n\n==Later history==\n{{expand section|material after the 6th century|date=October 2016}}\n\n==List of bishops==\n\n===to 1000===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Ursinus (395)\n* Romanus (465)\n* Athanasius (465\u2013487)\n* Chrysogonus (487\u2013495)\n* Homobonus (592)\n* Epifanio (649)\n* Giovenale (649\u2013682)\n* Andrea (721 \u2013 before 743)\n* Tiberio (743\u2013761)\n* Leone I (761 \u2013 before 767)\n* Eustasio (Eustrasio, Eustazio, Eustachio) (761\u2013769)\n* Costante (Costantino) (772 \u2013 before 826)\n* Benedetto (826 \u2013 before 844)\n* Petronacio (853 \u2013 ca. 867)\n* Paul (869 \u2013 before 898)\n* Peter I (898\u2013?)\n* Gregorio (963\u2013985)\n* [[Teobaldo]] (995\u2013996)\n* Giovanni (996\u20131001)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===1000\u20131200===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pietro Martino Boccapecora]], (1004\u20131009), afterwards Pope Sergius IV (1009\u201312)\n* Teobaldo (1012\u20131044)<ref>Sources for the period 1012\u20131130: Klewitz, p. 33, 116 and 120; and H\u00fcls, pp. 88\u201398</ref>\n* Bonifazio (1049\u20131068)<ref>Some sources mention{{who|date=October 2016}} cardinal Basilius ca.1072/73 but his existence has not been ascertained (cf.

[[Albano Laziale]] is situated some 15 kilometers from Rome, on the [[Appian Way]].\n\nIt has both a [[titular bishop]] and a [[diocesan bishop]].\n\n==Early history==\n\nIn the very year of his consulate, [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Acilius Glabrio]] was compelled by Domitian to fight, unarmed, in the amphitheatre at Albano, a Numidian bear, according to [[Juvenal]]:<ref>Juvenal, ''Satires'' IV, 99</ref> an enormous lion, according to [[Dio Cassius]].<ref>Cassius Dio Cocceianus, ''History of Rome'', LXVI, iii.</ref> This same Acilius Glabrio is later included in a Christian group of the Flavian family as a ''molitor rerum novarum''.<ref>Suetonius, \"Life of Domitian\", 10.</ref> The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' under the name Silvester<ref>{{cite book|editor=Louis Duchesne|title=Le Liber pontificalis: texte, introduction et commentaire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1Q-AAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume I, pars 1|year=1884|publisher=E. de Boccard|location=Paris|language=Latin|pages=184\u2013185}}</ref> says:\n\n:''fecit basilicam Augustus Constantinus in civitate Albanensis, videlicet S.

Under the basilica there was a [[crypt]], or ''confessio'', from which bodies were transferred to the cemetery nearby.\n\nThe foundation of the episcopal see of Albano is very probably contemporaneous with the erection of the Constantinian basilica. However, the first bishop of the see of whom we have any knowledge is Dionysius (d. 355). It is more than a century later (463) that we meet with another Bishop of Albano, Romanus. To these is to be added Ursinus, whose name is found on an inscription in the [[Catacomb of Domitilla]]. The consular date is either 345 or 395. The importance of this early Christian community is apparent from its cemetery, discovered in 1720 by [[Marangoni]]. It differs but little from the Christian cemeteries found in Rome. Its plan, clearly mapped out in the ''Epitome de locis ss. martyrum quae sunt foris civitatis Romae'', is considered by [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]] as the synopsis of an ancient description of the cemeteries, written before the end of the 6th century:\n\n:''per eandem vere viam (Appiam) pervenitur ad Albanam civitatem et per eandem civitatem ad ecclesiam S. Senatoris ubi et Perpetua jacet corpore et innumeri sancti et magna mirabilia ibidem geruntur.''\n\nThe saints here named are not known. [[Saint Senator of Albano]] is inserted without further explanation in the [[martyrology]] for 26 September (''et in Albano Senatoris''). From this he passed to the ''[[Roman martyrology]]'', where he is commemorated on the same day. But the first account of the martyrs of Albano is found in the ''[[Almanac of Philocalus]]'' (4th century) on 8 August:\n\n:''VI Idus aug. Carpophori, Victorini et Severiani, Albano, et Ostense septimo ballistaria, Cyriaci, Largi, Crescentiani, Memmiae, Julianae, et Smaragdi.''\n\nThe cemetery has frescoes, painted at various times by unknown artists, which show the progress of Christian art from the fourth to the 9th century.\n\n==Later history==\n{{expand section|material after the 6th century|date=October 2016}}\n\n==List of bishops==\n\n===to 1000===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Ursinus (395)\n* Romanus (465)\n* Athanasius (465\u2013487)\n* Chrysogonus (487\u2013495)\n* Homobonus (592)\n* Epifanio (649)\n* Giovenale (649\u2013682)\n* Andrea (721 \u2013 before 743)\n* Tiberio (743\u2013761)\n* Leone I (761 \u2013 before 767)\n* Eustasio (Eustrasio, Eustazio, Eustachio) (761\u2013769)\n* Costante (Costantino) (772 \u2013 before 826)\n* Benedetto (826 \u2013 before 844)\n* Petronacio (853 \u2013 ca. 867)\n* Paul (869 \u2013 before 898)\n* Peter I (898\u2013?)\n* Gregorio (963\u2013985)\n* [[Teobaldo]] (995\u2013996)\n* Giovanni (996\u20131001)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===1000\u20131200===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pietro Martino Boccapecora]], (1004\u20131009), afterwards Pope Sergius IV (1009\u201312)\n* Teobaldo (1012\u20131044)<ref>Sources for the period 1012\u20131130: Klewitz, p. 33, 116 and 120; and H\u00fcls, pp. 88\u201398</ref>\n* Bonifazio (1049\u20131068)<ref>Some sources mention{{who|date=October 2016}} cardinal Basilius ca.1072/73 but his existence has not been ascertained (cf.
