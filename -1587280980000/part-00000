The structure of these molecules may be considered at any of several length scales ranging from the level of individual [[atom]]s to the relationships among entire [[protein subunits]]. This useful distinction among scales is often expressed as a decomposition of molecular structure into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The scaffold for this multiscale organization of the molecule arises at the secondary level, where the fundamental structural elements are the molecule's various [[hydrogen bond]]s. This leads to several recognizable ''domains'' of [[protein structure]] and [[nucleic acid structure]], including such secondary-structure features as [[alpha helix]]es and [[beta sheet]]s for proteins, and [[hairpin loop]]s, bulges, and internal loops for nucleic acids.\nThe terms ''primary'', ''secondary'', ''tertiary'', and ''quaternary structure'' were introduced by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang]] in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Primary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein primary structure|Nucleic acid primary structure}}\n\nThe ''primary structure'' of a [[biopolymer]] is the exact specification of its atomic composition and the chemical bonds connecting those atoms (including [[stereochemistry]]).

In other words, it is the prediction of secondary and tertiary structure from its primary structure.  Structure prediction is the inverse of biomolecular design, as in [[rational design]], [[protein design]], [[nucleic acid design]], and [[biomolecular engineering]].\n\nProtein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. Protein structure prediction is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzyme]]s). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the ''Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction'' ([[CASP]]) experiment.\n\nThere has also been a significant amount of [[bioinformatics]] research directed at the RNA structure prediction problem.  A common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only the nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA, much of the final structure is determined by the [[secondary structure]] or intra-molecular base-pairing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of [[base pair]]ings across diverse species.\n\nSecondary structure of small nucleic acid molecules is determined largely by strong, local interactions such as [[hydrogen bond]]s and [[base stacking]]. Summing the free energy for such interactions, usually using a [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Nearest-neighbor method|nearest-neighbor method]], provides an approximation for the stability of given structure.<ref name=\"Mathews06\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathews DH | title = Revolutions in RNA secondary structure prediction | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 359 | issue = 3 | pages = 526\u201332 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16500677 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.067 }}</ref> The most straightforward way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for them, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of the molecule.<ref name=\"Zuker84\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuker M, Sankoff D | year = 1984 | title = RNA secondary structures and their prediction | journal = Bull.

In other words, it is the prediction of secondary and tertiary structure from its primary structure.  Structure prediction is the inverse of biomolecular design, as in [[rational design]], [[protein design]], [[nucleic acid design]], and [[biomolecular engineering]].\n\nProtein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. Protein structure prediction is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzyme]]s). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the ''Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction'' ([[CASP]]) experiment.\n\nThere has also been a significant amount of [[bioinformatics]] research directed at the RNA structure prediction problem.  A common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only the nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA, much of the final structure is determined by the [[secondary structure]] or intra-molecular base-pairing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of [[base pair]]ings across diverse species.\n\nSecondary structure of small nucleic acid molecules is determined largely by strong, local interactions such as [[hydrogen bond]]s and [[base stacking]]. Summing the free energy for such interactions, usually using a [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Nearest-neighbor method|nearest-neighbor method]], provides an approximation for the stability of given structure.<ref name=\"Mathews06\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathews DH | title = Revolutions in RNA secondary structure prediction | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 359 | issue = 3 | pages = 526\u201332 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16500677 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.067 }}</ref> The most straightforward way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for them, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of the molecule.<ref name=\"Zuker84\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuker M, Sankoff D | year = 1984 | title = RNA secondary structures and their prediction | journal = Bull.

These methods analyze the covariation of individual base sites in [[evolution]]; maintenance at two widely separated sites of a pair of base-pairing [[nucleotide]]s indicates the presence of a structurally required hydrogen bond between those positions.

Since the closure of [[Leuchars Station|RAF Leuchars]] in 2015, Lossiemouth is the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4]] in the United Kingdom. It is home to four front-line units which operate the Typhoon ([[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 (AC) Squadron]], [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] and [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]]) each of which contribute to the [[Quick Reaction Alert|Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North]] capability which provides continuous protection of UK airspace.\n\nThe airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF, predominantly as part of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], until 1946 when it transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) and became known as '''RNAS Lossiemouth''' or '''HMS ''Fulmar'''''. Lossiemouth was used as a training station by the FAA until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has largely operated as a fast-jet base.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure is planned at Lossiemouth in order to accommodate the RAF's new fleet of [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|Boeing Poseidon MRA1]] aircraft, which are expected to enter service in 2020. No. 120 Squadron reformed in early 2018 and will be the first to equip with the aircraft.\n\n==History==\n=== Construction (1938\u20131939) ===\nConstruction started during the summer of 1938, when {{convert|220|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land was acquired in order to accommodate the airfield. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. [[Group captain|Group Captain]] P.E Maitland was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=4\u20136}}  The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was [[No. 15 Flying Training School RAF]] (15 FTS), initially equipped with thirteen [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and five [[Hawker Hart]]s.{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=142}} Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n===Second World War (1939\u20131945)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], a detachment of [[Seaforth Highlanders]] was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station, and anti-aircraft defences were installed. Flying activity increased, with 15 FTS receiving more Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the [[North American Harvard]]; eleven [[Fairey Battle]]s were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers belonging to [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]], arriving in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German [[cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}, which was operating between Iceland and the [[Shetland|Shetland Isles]].{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}} January 1940 saw detachments of [[Handley Page Hampden]]s from [[No. 44 Squadron RAF|No. 44 Squadron]] and [[No. 50 Squadron RAF|No. 50 Squadron]] arrive to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However, the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid-February.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Vickers-wellington-bomber-01.png|left|thumb|Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 9 Squadron.]]\nA detachment of [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940, before being replaced by [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|No. 107 Squadron]] and [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No. 110 Squadron]], which were equipped with [[Bristol Blenheim]]s. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIt soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth, and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate 15 FTS to [[RAF Middle Wallop]] in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit's departure, Lossiemouth transferred to [[No. 6 Group RAF|No. 6 Group]] of [[RAF Bomber Command]] and [[No. 20 Operational Training Unit]] (20 OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and [[Avro Anson]]s.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}}\n\nNo. 46 Maintenance Unit (46 MU) was also formed in April 1940. 46 MU's role was to modify and fit out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced, including [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, [[Hawker Audax]]es, and a [[de Havilland Hornet Moth]]. The unit primarily used six [[Robin hangar|Robin]] and eight [[Super Robin hangar]]s; however, due to a shortage of space, many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}} Lossiemouth's first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south and known as [[RAF Elgin]], opened in June 1940.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p = 7}}\n\nOne officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' for the first time.

Operational sorties were predominately undertaken by Blenheims of [[No. 21 Squadron RAF|No. 21 Squadron]], [[No. 82 Squadron RAF|No. 82 Squadron]], No. 110 Squadron and [[No. 114 Squadron RAF|No. 114 Squadron]]. By the winter of 1941 the airfield had become so muddy that the Wellingtons of 20 OTU were temporarily relocated to [[RAF Lakenheath]] in Suffolk.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=111}} The increased activity by 46 MU resulted in two [[List of Royal Air Force Satellite Landing Grounds|satellite landing grounds (SLG)]] being established to store aircraft off-site. These were at [[RAF Black Isle]] (42 SLG) where [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s were kept and [[RAF Leanach]] (43 SLG) near [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]], where Hurricanes and [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s were stored.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=9}}\n\nLossiemouth was used during 1942 as a base to launch [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|several unsuccessful missions]] to sink the German [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, which at the time was operating in Norwegian [[fjord]]s. The first missions were undertaken in January 1942 by a detachment of thirteen [[Short Stirling]]s of [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|No. 15 Squadron]] and [[No. 149 Squadron RAF|No. 149 Squadron]] and thirteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es of [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|No. 10 Squadron]] and [[No. 76 Squadron RAF|No. 76 Squadron]]. Further attempts were made during March by [[Avro Lancaster]]s of No. 44 Squadron and Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron. Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron later joined the operation.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} 1942 also saw numerous accidents involving 20 OTU aircraft, many of which resulted in death and serious injuries. These accidents were attributed to a combination of fatigued aircraft, inexperienced crews and poor weather.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} Wellingtons of 20 OTU were also involved in [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing raids]] on German cities throughout 1942, the training aircraft being required to help reach the target number of 1000 bombers per raid.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=112}} The airfield's first surfaced runways, (06/24 {{convert|1828|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 09/27 {{convert|1371|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 01/19 {{convert|1280|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}), were constructed by an [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|engineering battalion]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]] in late 1942 and helped to reduce interruptions to flying as a result of the grass strips being affected by poor weather. A new control tower was also constructed.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, Wellingtons of 'C' Flight 20 OTU, moved to the second of the Lossiemouth satellite airfields, [[RAF Milltown]], located {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east. By now 46 MU were concentrating their work on Bristol Beaufighters and Lancasters and the SLG at RAF Leanach had been replaced with a new site at [[Dornoch]] golf course, which became known as [[RAF Dornoch]] (40 SLG).{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=11}} 20 OTU received its official crest in 1943, with two examples cast in concrete being constructed at Lossiemouth and RAF Elgin.

Since the closure of [[Leuchars Station|RAF Leuchars]] in 2015, Lossiemouth is the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4]] in the United Kingdom. It is home to four front-line units which operate the Typhoon ([[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 (AC) Squadron]], [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] and [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]]) each of which contribute to the [[Quick Reaction Alert|Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North]] capability which provides continuous protection of UK airspace.\n\nThe airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF, predominantly as part of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], until 1946 when it transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) and became known as '''RNAS Lossiemouth''' or '''HMS ''Fulmar'''''. Lossiemouth was used as a training station by the FAA until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has largely operated as a fast-jet base.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure is planned at Lossiemouth in order to accommodate the RAF's new fleet of [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|Boeing Poseidon MRA1]] aircraft, which are expected to enter service in 2020. No. 120 Squadron reformed in early 2018 and will be the first to equip with the aircraft.\n\n==History==\n=== Construction (1938\u20131939) ===\nConstruction started during the summer of 1938, when {{convert|220|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land was acquired in order to accommodate the airfield. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. [[Group captain|Group Captain]] P.E Maitland was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=4\u20136}}  The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was [[No. 15 Flying Training School RAF]] (15 FTS), initially equipped with thirteen [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and five [[Hawker Hart]]s.{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=142}} Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n===Second World War (1939\u20131945)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], a detachment of [[Seaforth Highlanders]] was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station, and anti-aircraft defences were installed. Flying activity increased, with 15 FTS receiving more Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the [[North American Harvard]]; eleven [[Fairey Battle]]s were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers belonging to [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]], arriving in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German [[cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}, which was operating between Iceland and the [[Shetland|Shetland Isles]].{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}} January 1940 saw detachments of [[Handley Page Hampden]]s from [[No. 44 Squadron RAF|No. 44 Squadron]] and [[No. 50 Squadron RAF|No. 50 Squadron]] arrive to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However, the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid-February.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Vickers-wellington-bomber-01.png|left|thumb|Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 9 Squadron.]]\nA detachment of [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940, before being replaced by [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|No. 107 Squadron]] and [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No. 110 Squadron]], which were equipped with [[Bristol Blenheim]]s. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIt soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth, and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate 15 FTS to [[RAF Middle Wallop]] in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit's departure, Lossiemouth transferred to [[No. 6 Group RAF|No. 6 Group]] of [[RAF Bomber Command]] and [[No. 20 Operational Training Unit]] (20 OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and [[Avro Anson]]s.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}}\n\nNo. 46 Maintenance Unit (46 MU) was also formed in April 1940. 46 MU's role was to modify and fit out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced, including [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, [[Hawker Audax]]es, and a [[de Havilland Hornet Moth]]. The unit primarily used six [[Robin hangar|Robin]] and eight [[Super Robin hangar]]s; however, due to a shortage of space, many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}} Lossiemouth's first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south and known as [[RAF Elgin]], opened in June 1940.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p = 7}}\n\nOne officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' for the first time. The attack by three [[Heinkel He 111]]s resulted in the destruction of two Blenheims and damage to two [[Miles Magister]]s, two Tiger Moths and a Hurricane. Three hangars were also damaged, the resultant holes from cannon fire still visible today.<ref name=\"online.aberdeenshire.gov.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://online.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/smrpub/master/detail.aspx?redirect=y&refno=NJ26NW0045|title=Aberdeenshire Council Sites and Monuments Record \u2013 Moray \u2013 NJ26NW0045 \u2013 RAF Lossiemouth|date=18 February 2016|website=Aberdeenshire Council|language=en|access-date=23 April 2017}}</ref> One of the Heinkels crashed on the airfield, having either been hit by ground fire or destroyed by its own bombs.

Operational sorties were predominately undertaken by Blenheims of [[No. 21 Squadron RAF|No. 21 Squadron]], [[No. 82 Squadron RAF|No. 82 Squadron]], No. 110 Squadron and [[No. 114 Squadron RAF|No. 114 Squadron]]. By the winter of 1941 the airfield had become so muddy that the Wellingtons of 20 OTU were temporarily relocated to [[RAF Lakenheath]] in Suffolk.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=111}} The increased activity by 46 MU resulted in two [[List of Royal Air Force Satellite Landing Grounds|satellite landing grounds (SLG)]] being established to store aircraft off-site. These were at [[RAF Black Isle]] (42 SLG) where [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s were kept and [[RAF Leanach]] (43 SLG) near [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]], where Hurricanes and [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s were stored.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=9}}\n\nLossiemouth was used during 1942 as a base to launch [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|several unsuccessful missions]] to sink the German [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, which at the time was operating in Norwegian [[fjord]]s. The first missions were undertaken in January 1942 by a detachment of thirteen [[Short Stirling]]s of [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|No. 15 Squadron]] and [[No. 149 Squadron RAF|No. 149 Squadron]] and thirteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es of [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|No. 10 Squadron]] and [[No. 76 Squadron RAF|No. 76 Squadron]]. Further attempts were made during March by [[Avro Lancaster]]s of No. 44 Squadron and Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron. Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron later joined the operation.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} 1942 also saw numerous accidents involving 20 OTU aircraft, many of which resulted in death and serious injuries. These accidents were attributed to a combination of fatigued aircraft, inexperienced crews and poor weather.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} Wellingtons of 20 OTU were also involved in [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing raids]] on German cities throughout 1942, the training aircraft being required to help reach the target number of 1000 bombers per raid.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=112}} The airfield's first surfaced runways, (06/24 {{convert|1828|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 09/27 {{convert|1371|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 01/19 {{convert|1280|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}), were constructed by an [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|engineering battalion]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]] in late 1942 and helped to reduce interruptions to flying as a result of the grass strips being affected by poor weather. A new control tower was also constructed.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, Wellingtons of 'C' Flight 20 OTU, moved to the second of the Lossiemouth satellite airfields, [[RAF Milltown]], located {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east. By now 46 MU were concentrating their work on Bristol Beaufighters and Lancasters and the SLG at RAF Leanach had been replaced with a new site at [[Dornoch]] golf course, which became known as [[RAF Dornoch]] (40 SLG).{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=11}} 20 OTU received its official crest in 1943, with two examples cast in concrete being constructed at Lossiemouth and RAF Elgin. The crest at Lossiemouth no longer exists and although little now remains of the airfield at Elgin, the concrete crest is a war memorial for those who served there.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Elgin Airfield {{!}} Canmore|url = http://canmore.org.uk/site/81853/elgin-airfield|website = canmore.org.uk|accessdate =8 November 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Bomber Command CH17863.jpg|left|thumb|A No. 617 Squadron crew and their Lancaster following the successful operation launched from Lossiemouth against the battleship ''Tirpitz'' on 12 November 1944.]]\nFurther operations against ''Tirpitz'' took place between September and November 1944.

It is the only European species of the genus ''[[Charaxes]]''.\n\n==Description==\n{{Lepidopteran glossary hatnote}}\n''Charaxes jasius'' is a medium to large butterfly with a [[wingspan]] reaching 65\u201375&nbsp;mm in males and 75\u201390&nbsp;mm in females.<ref name=Woodhall>{{cite book|last=Woodhall |first=Steve |title=Field Guide to Butterflies of South Africa |year=2005 |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Struik |isbn=978-1-86872-724-7 }}</ref> The uppersides of the wings are dark brown with orange margins. The hindwings bring two short tails, characteristic of most species of the genus. Close to these tails there are a few blue markings. The underside of the wings is reddish brown with numerous darker bands edged with white or gray. The orange marginal band is also present on the undersides of the wings and it is preceded by a white transversal band.  Sexes alike.\n<gallery>\nFile:Charaxes_jasius_MHNT_CUT_2013_3_12_male_Roquebrun_34_Dorsal.jpg|Upperside\nFile:Charaxes_jasius_MHNT_CUT_2013_3_12_male_Roquebrun_34_Ventral.jpg|Underside\n</gallery>\n\n==Life cycle==\n''Charaxes jasius'' is [[bivoltine]], i.e. it has two generations per year. The first batch of eggs are laid in May\u2013June and the second in August\u2013September. The second batch caterpillars spend the winter in the larval stage, and pupate the next spring. The female lays the eggs on the upper surface of the leaves of the host plant, laying no more than one egg per leaf.<ref name=\"James2017\">{{cite book|last=James|first=David G.|title=The Book of Caterpillars: A Life-Size Guide to Six Hundred Species from Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTo8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207|accessdate=17 April 2020|date=17 October 2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28736-2|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe caterpillar is green, cylindrical and up to {{convert|50|mm|in}} long. It has rings of yellow-white raised spots on the body, yellow lateral lines along the sides, and two yellow ocelli on the back. The head bears four horns facing backwards. The caterpillar makes a leaf tent from silken threads, to which it returns after feeding on surrounding leaves.<ref name=\"James2017\"/>\n\nWhen the caterpillar is fully matured, it hangs on a twig and pupates. The pupa resembles a ripening fruit as it is first green and becomes brown as the imago develops inside.<ref name=\"James2017\"/> After a period that can range from two weeks to one month, the pupal case opens letting out the adult butterfly.\n<gallery>\nFile:Egg of Charaxes jasius - Two-tailed Pasha.jpg|Egg\nFile:Charaxes jasius larva.jpg|Larva\nFile:Charaxes jasius pupa.jpg|Newly formed pupa\nFile:Pupa_of_Charaxes_jasius_just_before_hatching.jpg|Pupa ready for hatching\nFile:Charaxes jasius bl1.jpg|Adult\n</gallery>\n\n==Food plants==\nThe adults prefer ripe fruits, of which they suck the sugary liquids.

It is the only European species of the genus ''[[Charaxes]]''.\n\n==Description==\n{{Lepidopteran glossary hatnote}}\n''Charaxes jasius'' is a medium to large butterfly with a [[wingspan]] reaching 65\u201375&nbsp;mm in males and 75\u201390&nbsp;mm in females.<ref name=Woodhall>{{cite book|last=Woodhall |first=Steve |title=Field Guide to Butterflies of South Africa |year=2005 |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Struik |isbn=978-1-86872-724-7 }}</ref> The uppersides of the wings are dark brown with orange margins. The hindwings bring two short tails, characteristic of most species of the genus. Close to these tails there are a few blue markings. The underside of the wings is reddish brown with numerous darker bands edged with white or gray. The orange marginal band is also present on the undersides of the wings and it is preceded by a white transversal band.  Sexes alike.\n<gallery>\nFile:Charaxes_jasius_MHNT_CUT_2013_3_12_male_Roquebrun_34_Dorsal.jpg|Upperside\nFile:Charaxes_jasius_MHNT_CUT_2013_3_12_male_Roquebrun_34_Ventral.jpg|Underside\n</gallery>\n\n==Life cycle==\n''Charaxes jasius'' has two generations per year: the first batch of eggs are laid in May\u2013June and the second in August\u2013September. The second batch caterpillars spend the winter in the larval stage, and pupate the next spring. The female lays the eggs on the upper surface of the leaves of the host plant, laying no more than one egg per leaf.<ref name=\"James2017\">{{cite book|last=James|first=David G.|title=The Book of Caterpillars: A Life-Size Guide to Six Hundred Species from Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTo8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207|accessdate=17 April 2020|date=17 October 2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28736-2|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe caterpillar is green, cylindrical and up to {{convert|50|mm|in}} long. It has rings of yellow-white raised spots on the body, yellow lateral lines along the sides, and two yellow ocelli on the back. The head bears four horns facing backwards. The caterpillar makes a leaf tent from silken threads, to which it returns after feeding on surrounding leaves.<ref name=\"James2017\"/>\n\nWhen the caterpillar is fully matured, it hangs on a twig and pupates. The pupa resembles a ripening fruit as it is first green and becomes brown as the imago develops inside.<ref name=\"James2017\"/> After a period that can range from two weeks to one month, the pupal case opens letting out the adult butterfly.\n<gallery>\nFile:Egg of Charaxes jasius - Two-tailed Pasha.jpg|Egg\nFile:Charaxes jasius larva.jpg|Larva\nFile:Charaxes jasius pupa.jpg|Newly formed pupa\nFile:Pupa_of_Charaxes_jasius_just_before_hatching.jpg|Pupa ready for hatching\nFile:Charaxes jasius bl1.jpg|Adult\n</gallery>\n\n==Food plants==\nThe adults prefer ripe fruits, of which they suck the sugary liquids.
