Most [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-to-select-your-robs-promoter ROBS promoters] and facilitators pay substantial referral fees to the franchise brokers. These fees are rarely disclosed to the entrepreneur. Fees charged by most promoters are higher than would be charged by attorneys and accountants, who are prohibited from paying referral fees. Some companies offering ROBS plans do not pay referral fees to brokers, and charge lower fees as a result. There remains a substantial question whether such referral fees are illegal under [[ERISA]] and the U.S. Criminal Code: Offer, Acceptance, or Solicitation to Influence Operations of Employee Benefit Plan (18 U.S.C.

The IRS issues a favorable DL if a plan's terms meet Internal Revenue Code requirements. A favorable DL does not give plan sponsors protection from incorrectly applying the plan's terms, nor from operating the plan in a discriminatory manner. When a plan sponsor administers a plan in a way that results in prohibited discrimination or engages in prohibited transactions, it can result in plan disqualification and adverse tax consequences to the plan's sponsor and its participants.

If their company stock is valued at more than they want to pay to buy it back, there is a set of provisions in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] that permit tax deferral and [[capital gains tax]] treatment when utilizing certain methods of exiting a ROBS plan<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n=== Main Methods for Exiting the ROBS Strategy<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\n\n# Full or Partial Redemption (e.g. buyback) of Stock\n# Early Redemption (e.g. buyback) of Stock\n# Distribution of Stock In Kind\n# Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)\n# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) Strategy\n\n==== '''The Closure and Sale of the Business'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ====\nThe [[C corporation|C Corporation]] needs to buy the stock back from the plan before the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can be dissolved and the plan can be terminated. Employer Securities (QES) - the private stock of the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] that is held/owned by the [[401(k) plan|401(k) Plan]] - must be redeemed (e.g. bought back) and the sales proceeds allocated pursuant to ownership of the [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. <blockquote>\"For example, if the plan is a 75% owner of the C Corporation, the 401(k) Plan is entitled to 75% of the proceeds of the sale. This requirement applies even if the value of the stock is now at $0, due to business closure. The Department of Labor still expects to see, before the 401(k) Plan is terminated, that the stock was removed from the plan.\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Additional investments need to be transferred out of the plan. If any additional investments, assets, dollars (e.g. cash) are held in the name of the plan, those assets must be distributed or rolled/transferred out of the plan before the plan can be fully terminated and the final [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/tax-season-has-begun-how-to-get-a-copy-of-your-retirement-pl IRS Form 5500] filed. Proceeds from the sale of the business should then be returned to the [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. With stock bought back, investments transferred, and proceeds returned, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can be dissolved and the plan can be terminated. If no further business is to be conducted, and the stock is redeemed, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can then be dissolved and the plan can be terminated, pursuant to [[Department Of Labor|Department of Labor]] and [[Internal Revenue Service]] requirements.\n\n=== '''Full or Partial Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nA redemption of stock occurs when the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] buys some or all of its stock back from the plan. The decision to have the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] buy the stock back, from the 401(k) Plan, is often a very strategic one. This is a decision that should be made based on several factors including: \n\n# Priorities of the business\n# Priorities of the business owner(s)\n# Retirement savings needs\n# Tax deduction needs\n# Business expansion/financing needs\n\nGiven the tricky nature of this strategy, it\u2019s best to work with a [[Third-party administrator|Third Party Administrator]], an [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974|ERISA]] attorney, and a [[tax advisor]] when exiting a ROBS business financing strategy.\n\nOnce the decision has been made to redeem stock, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] engages in a partial or full stock buyback from the [[401(k) plan|401(k) Plan]]. The [[C corporation|C Corporation]] needs to come up with the money to buy a certain amount of stock/shares back from the plan at the current fair market value of the stock. It is a common misconception that the stock can be bought back for the original price that the plan paid for the stock. Full or partial redemptions are allowed however, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] cannot be converted out of [[C corporation|C Corporation]] status until all stock has been redeemed from the Plan.\n\nThere are various ways a corporation will generally raise cash for this kind of buyback, including, obtaining a traditional bank/[[Small Business Administration|SBA]] loan, retaining revenue, or accepting a loan from a third party (in limited instances the third party can be the same individual who runs the company). The actual buyback process is as follows<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n'''Step 1:''' ''Stock valuation''. The company stock should be valued by an outside, independent firm; this may generally include an informal valuation from your [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]], if he/she does them or a formal valuation from a valuation firm. \n\n'''Step 2:''' ''Stock redemption authorization''. A corporate resolution should be drafted, authorizing the redemption of stock between the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] and the Plan. \n\n'''Step 3:''' ''Return the proceeds.'' The proceeds from the redemption need to be returned back to the plan based on its rightful share, by sending the monies back to the plan account.\n\n'''Step 4:''' ''Stock certificate redemption.'' Stock certificates should be \u201credeemed\u201d, the stock that is purchased back usually becomes un-issued stock for the time being.\n\n'''Step 5:''' ''Stock ledger revisions.'' The stock ledger needs to be revised, reflecting the updated ownership (the plan is no longer a shareholder or has a lesser amount of ownership). The monies - including earnings that are returned to the plan - can be invested in more traditional investments like mutual funds. You could also use the monies and earnings for other non-traditional or business financing needs in the future.\n\n'''Step 6:''' ''Conversion.'' Once all stock is fully redeemed by the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] from the plan, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can convert to [[S corporation|S Corporation]] status and the plan can either continue to exist or it can be terminated.\n\n=== '''Partial Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nA partial redemption of stock occurs when smaller amounts of stock are purchased back by the [[C corporation|C Corporation]], from the plan, in multiple transactions over time. For a partial redemption, if the company valuation is higher than cash on hand, the plan and [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can enter into an amortized payment schedule to settle the buyout. This allows for a controlled distribution of the profts to the plan. It can also help mitigate the impact of being taxed as a [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. This method extends the amount of time that the business remains a [[C corporation|C Corporation]], and comes with high costs from the administrator for the redemption. \n\nThere are requirements related to valuing corporate stock each time a partial buyback is completed. Generally, you must value the stock each time you engage in a partial buyback although the facts and circumstances of your partial buybacks may allow for utilizing a prior or historical valuation. Partial buybacks can end up being a rather expensive approach to buying back the stock as additional costs apply each time there is a redemption and this approach is rarely utilized as a result.\n\n=== '''Early Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nThe early redemption method tends to be utilized by entrepreneurs who need business financing for only a short period of time. The business owner invests [[401(k)]] monies into the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] and within 1-2 years, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] is able to raise enough funds to buy the stock back, in full, from the plan. This allows for a quick exit and conversion to [[S corporation|S Corporation]] status. However, the amount returned to the [[401(k)]] account of the participant may be less than that originally deposited depending on how the value of the company stock has fluctuated, if at all.\n\nThis method is not often utilized because most new businesses can\u2019t raise enough capital, this early, to buy the stock back. Additionally, it is generally not recommended that you terminate the plan, in conjunction with the early buyback. Federal regulations require, that when you establish a [[401(k)|401(k) Plan]], you establish it with the intent of providing a \u201cpermanent\u201d employee benefit to and for you and your workforce. Five (5) years is generally the minimum number of years you need to have a plan operational to show that you intended to put in place and offer a permanent employee benefit. Exceptions can be made for business hardship necessitating an early termination of the plan.\n\n=== '''Distribution of Stock In Kind'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nFor this method, unlike the full or partial redemption strategy, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] stock does not need to be liquidated and can be distributed or transferred \u201cin kind\u201d.\u00a0 An \u201cin kind\u201d distribution is a payment made in the form of securities or other property, rather than in cash. A distribution in kind may be made in several different situations, including a stock dividend, inheritance, or taking securities out of a tax-deferred account. \n\nWith the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-business-financing-strategy-work-the-8-ste ROBS strategy], an in kind distribution or transfer means that the stock is transferred directly to an individual or another retirement account, without first liquidating the stock into a cash state. This works for individuals that are not ready to or can\u2019t afford to pay the value of the stock to redeem it or want to continue to hold onto the stock for tax advantages and other beneficial reasons. The retirement plan legal documents (e.g. Adoption Agreement) must allow for the \u201cin kind\u201d distribution or transfer of the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-also-known-as-the-qualified-employer-secur Employer Securities] (QES).\n\n=== '''Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nRequired Minimum Distributions are minimum amounts that a retirement plan account owner must withdraw annually starting with the year that he or she reaches 70.5 years of age or the year in which he or she retires (if over 70.5). However, if the retirement plan account is an [[Individual retirement account|IRA]] or the account owner is a 5% owner of the business sponsoring the retirement plan, the RMDs must begin once the account holder is age 70.5, regardless of whether he or she is retired.\n\nIf the [[401(k)]] account holder who invested in the corporation is of an age to take RMDs, they can be taken in the form of the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-also-known-as-the-qualified-employer-secur Employer Securities] (QES)/corporate stock.

Employer Securities (QES) - the private stock of the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] that is held/owned by the [[401(k) plan|401(k) Plan]] - must be redeemed (e.g. bought back) and the sales proceeds allocated pursuant to ownership of the [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. <blockquote>\"For example, if the plan is a 75% owner of the C Corporation, the 401(k) Plan is entitled to 75% of the proceeds of the sale. This requirement applies even if the value of the stock is now at $0, due to business closure. The Department of Labor still expects to see, before the 401(k) Plan is terminated, that the stock was removed from the plan.\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Additional investments need to be transferred out of the plan. If any additional investments, assets, dollars (e.g. cash) are held in the name of the plan, those assets must be distributed or rolled/transferred out of the plan before the plan can be fully terminated and the final [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/tax-season-has-begun-how-to-get-a-copy-of-your-retirement-pl IRS Form 5500] filed. Proceeds from the sale of the business should then be returned to the [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. With stock bought back, investments transferred, and proceeds returned, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can be dissolved and the plan can be terminated. If no further business is to be conducted, and the stock is redeemed, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can then be dissolved and the plan can be terminated, pursuant to [[Department Of Labor|Department of Labor]] and [[Internal Revenue Service]] requirements.\n\n=== '''Full or Partial Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nA redemption of stock occurs when the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] buys some or all of its stock back from the plan. The decision to have the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] buy the stock back, from the 401(k) Plan, is often a very strategic one. This is a decision that should be made based on several factors including: \n\n# Priorities of the business\n# Priorities of the business owner(s)\n# Retirement savings needs\n# Tax deduction needs\n# Business expansion/financing needs\n\nGiven the tricky nature of this strategy, it\u2019s best to work with a [[Third-party administrator|Third Party Administrator]], an [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974|ERISA]] attorney, and a [[tax advisor]] when exiting a ROBS business financing strategy.\n\nOnce the decision has been made to redeem stock, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] engages in a partial or full stock buyback from the [[401(k) plan|401(k) Plan]]. The [[C corporation|C Corporation]] needs to come up with the money to buy a certain amount of stock/shares back from the plan at the current fair market value of the stock. It is a common misconception that the stock can be bought back for the original price that the plan paid for the stock. Full or partial redemptions are allowed however, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] cannot be converted out of [[C corporation|C Corporation]] status until all stock has been redeemed from the Plan.\n\nThere are various ways a corporation will generally raise cash for this kind of buyback, including, obtaining a traditional bank/[[Small Business Administration|SBA]] loan, retaining revenue, or accepting a loan from a third party (in limited instances the third party can be the same individual who runs the company). The actual buyback process is as follows<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n'''Step 1:''' ''Stock valuation''. The company stock should be valued by an outside, independent firm; this may generally include an informal valuation from your [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]], if he/she does them or a formal valuation from a valuation firm. \n\n'''Step 2:''' ''Stock redemption authorization''. A corporate resolution should be drafted, authorizing the redemption of stock between the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] and the Plan. \n\n'''Step 3:''' ''Return the proceeds.'' The proceeds from the redemption need to be returned back to the plan based on its rightful share, by sending the monies back to the plan account.\n\n'''Step 4:''' ''Stock certificate redemption.'' Stock certificates should be \u201credeemed\u201d, the stock that is purchased back usually becomes un-issued stock for the time being.\n\n'''Step 5:''' ''Stock ledger revisions.'' The stock ledger needs to be revised, reflecting the updated ownership (the plan is no longer a shareholder or has a lesser amount of ownership). The monies - including earnings that are returned to the plan - can be invested in more traditional investments like mutual funds. You could also use the monies and earnings for other non-traditional or business financing needs in the future.\n\n'''Step 6:''' ''Conversion.'' Once all stock is fully redeemed by the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] from the plan, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can convert to [[S corporation|S Corporation]] status and the plan can either continue to exist or it can be terminated.\n\n=== '''Partial Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nA partial redemption of stock occurs when smaller amounts of stock are purchased back by the [[C corporation|C Corporation]], from the plan, in multiple transactions over time. For a partial redemption, if the company valuation is higher than cash on hand, the plan and [[C corporation|C Corporation]] can enter into an amortized payment schedule to settle the buyout. This allows for a controlled distribution of the profts to the plan. It can also help mitigate the impact of being taxed as a [[C corporation|C Corporation]]. This method extends the amount of time that the business remains a [[C corporation|C Corporation]], and comes with high costs from the administrator for the redemption. \n\nThere are requirements related to valuing corporate stock each time a partial buyback is completed. Generally, you must value the stock each time you engage in a partial buyback although the facts and circumstances of your partial buybacks may allow for utilizing a prior or historical valuation. Partial buybacks can end up being a rather expensive approach to buying back the stock as additional costs apply each time there is a redemption and this approach is rarely utilized as a result.\n\n=== '''Early Redemption of Stock'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nThe early redemption method tends to be utilized by entrepreneurs who need business financing for only a short period of time. The business owner invests [[401(k)]] monies into the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] and within 1-2 years, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] is able to raise enough funds to buy the stock back, in full, from the plan. This allows for a quick exit and conversion to [[S corporation|S Corporation]] status. However, the amount returned to the [[401(k)]] account of the participant may be less than that originally deposited depending on how the value of the company stock has fluctuated, if at all.\n\nThis method is not often utilized because most new businesses can\u2019t raise enough capital, this early, to buy the stock back. Additionally, it is generally not recommended that you terminate the plan, in conjunction with the early buyback. Federal regulations require, that when you establish a [[401(k)|401(k) Plan]], you establish it with the intent of providing a \u201cpermanent\u201d employee benefit to and for you and your workforce. Five (5) years is generally the minimum number of years you need to have a plan operational to show that you intended to put in place and offer a permanent employee benefit. Exceptions can be made for business hardship necessitating an early termination of the plan.\n\n=== '''Distribution of Stock In Kind'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nFor this method, unlike the full or partial redemption strategy, the [[C corporation|C Corporation]] stock does not need to be liquidated and can be distributed or transferred \u201cin kind\u201d.\u00a0 An \u201cin kind\u201d distribution is a payment made in the form of securities or other property, rather than in cash. A distribution in kind may be made in several different situations, including a stock dividend, inheritance, or taking securities out of a tax-deferred account. \n\nWith the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-business-financing-strategy-work-the-8-ste ROBS strategy], an in kind distribution or transfer means that the stock is transferred directly to an individual or another retirement account, without first liquidating the stock into a cash state. This works for individuals that are not ready to or can\u2019t afford to pay the value of the stock to redeem it or want to continue to hold onto the stock for tax advantages and other beneficial reasons. The retirement plan legal documents (e.g. Adoption Agreement) must allow for the \u201cin kind\u201d distribution or transfer of the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-also-known-as-the-qualified-employer-secur Employer Securities] (QES).\n\n=== '''Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)'''<ref name=\":1\" /> ===\nRequired Minimum Distributions are minimum amounts that a retirement plan account owner must withdraw annually starting with the year that he or she reaches 70.5 years of age or the year in which he or she retires (if over 70.5). However, if the retirement plan account is an [[Ira|IRA]] or the account owner is a 5% owner of the business sponsoring the retirement plan, the RMDs must begin once the account holder is age 70.5, regardless of whether he or she is retired.\n\nIf the [[401(k)]] account holder who invested in the corporation is of an age to take RMDs, they can be taken in the form of the [https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/how-does-the-robs-also-known-as-the-qualified-employer-secur Employer Securities] (QES)/corporate stock.

If the company stock is valued at more than an entrepreneur wants to pay to buy it back, there is a set of provisions in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRS) that permits tax deferral and capital gains tax treatment when utilizing certain methods of exiting a ROBS Plan. The main method used is called the Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) transaction.\n\n====== For the NUA transaction, these 5 conditions must be met: ======\n\n# The ROBS participant needs to be at least 59.5 years old.*\n# All other Defined Contribution retirement plan accounts (sponsored by the employer) of the ROBS participant are also distributed/rolled out of the plan in the same tax year.\n# Employer securities must be distributed in-kind.\n# Employer securities must be distributed in the same tax year.\n# The shares should be valued by an independent, valuation firm prior to distribution.\n\nOnce the above conditions have been met, a ROBS participant exit can be initiated. The participant will owe only ordinary income tax in the year of distribution on the original rollover value of the shares, as of the date of the original ROBS transaction (as opposed to the current value of the shares).\n\n==See also==\n*[[American Association of Franchisees and Dealers]]\n*[[401(k) IRA matrix]]\n*[[403(b)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Internal Revenue Code]]\n[[Category:Individual retirement accounts]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Ira\u2192Individual retirement account", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollovers_as_business_start-ups"}

However, hourglasses had a poor precision because they needed to be turned by hand at exact intervals, because sand tended aggregate due to humidity, and because its flow eroded the thin section of the bulb, accelerating the flow.

In practice, this was achieved by keeping the time of the latest point of departure by mean of [[hourglass]]es, and by tracking the moment the sun was seen at its [[zenith]]. However, hourglasses had a poor precision because they needed to be turned by hand at exact intervals, because sand tended aggregate due to humidity, and because its flow eroded the thin section of the bulb, accelerating the flow. Mechanical clocks were seen as the logical next step in technology, and in 1722, eight years after the British introduced [[Longitude rewards]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]] started offering a prize every two year for the best chronometer for sea navigation.<ref name=Delacroix6>Delacroix, p. 6</ref> \n\nIn 1766, clockmaker [[Pierre Le Roy]] submitted a marine chronometer for consideration for the 1767 prize. At the time, several several other clockmakers in France were trying to develop similar instruments, notably [[Ferdinand Berthoud]], [[\u00c9tienne Tavernier]] and [[Jean Romilly]], but being unfinished or damaged at the time, their prototypes could not contest.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on'' ''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works.

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilized to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published.

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie\u2019s future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty\u2019s Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie\u2019s work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don\u2019t like messy deaths \u2026 I\u2019m more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]\u2019s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilized to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).
