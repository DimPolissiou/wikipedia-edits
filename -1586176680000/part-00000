A statue of her is located in Overlook Park along the Black River.\n\nThe family of Dr. Ransom S. Bettis is given the credit for being the first settlers on the land now called Pocahontas. Dr. Bettis' daughter, Cinderella, married Thomas S. Drew, and lived on 800 acres where the town of [[Biggers, Arkansas|Biggers]] now exists. Bettis and Drew led the founding of Pocahontas as the county seat of Randolph County.\n\nRandolph County is famous for many \"firsts\"; Arkansas' oldest town, Davidsonville, was established in 1815. The first Arkansas post office was built in Davidsonville in 1817, and the first state courthouse was established in 1818. The earliest land claim was in 1809 near what is now [[Ravenden Springs, Arkansas|Ravenden Springs]]. The first actual term of court convened in Arkansas was in 1815 in a part of [[Lawrence County, Arkansas|Lawrence County]] that was given over to Randolph County. And the country's first overland route, the Natchitoches Trail, went through parts of Randolph County.\n\nIn 1835, the Territorial Legislature granted the formation of Randolph County from part of the area then called Lawrence County. The county was named after John Randolph, who was one of the first settlers in the area.\n\nRandolph County encompasses the rolling hills of the [[Ozarks]] to the west and rich, flat farmland of the Mississippi Delta to the east. Five rivers flow through the county, providing access to fishing and canoeing. Soybeans, rice, and other grains are the principal crops in the Delta region, while cattle ranching dominates the hill country. The poultry industry is also a vital part of the area economy.\n\nThe industrial base is diversified, with products such as shoes, large truck trailers, technical components for communications, picture frames, golf bags and luggage, tool boxes, wood products and more.\n\nPocahontas is the county seat with a population of 6,616. The other 10,407 residents of Randolph County live in rural areas and five incorporated communities - [[Maynard, Arkansas|Maynard]], Biggers, [[Reyno, Arkansas|Reyno]], Ravenden Springs and [[O'Kean, Arkansas|O'Kean]].\n\nLocal legend holds that Pocahontas was named the county seat through an act of trickery. Supposedly, at the county meeting to determine which city would receive the title, the delegation from Pocahontas brought in large quantities of alcohol and distributed them to the other delegations. When the time came to vote, the only delegation not passed out or otherwise influenced was that from Pocahontas.\n\n==Geography==\nPocahontas is located at {{coord|36|15|49|N|90|58|24|W|type:city}} (36.263560, -90.973349).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|7.3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} (2.78%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is of the city is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

Soybeans, rice, and other grains are the principal crops in the Delta region, while cattle ranching dominates the hill country. The poultry industry is also a vital part of the area economy.\n\nThe industrial base is diversified, with products such as shoes, large truck trailers, technical components for communications, picture frames, golf bags and luggage, tool boxes, wood products and more.\n\nPocahontas is the county seat with a population of 6,616. The other 10,407 residents of Randolph County live in rural areas and five incorporated communities - [[Maynard, Arkansas|Maynard]], Biggers, [[Reyno, Arkansas|Reyno]], Ravenden Springs and [[O'Kean, Arkansas|O'Kean]].\n\nLocal legend holds that Pocahontas was named the county seat through an act of trickery. Supposedly, at the county meeting to determine which city would receive the title, the delegation from Pocahontas brought in large quantities of alcohol and distributed them to the other delegations. When the time came to vote, the only delegation not passed out or otherwise influenced was that from Pocahontas.\n\n==Geography==\nPocahontas is located at {{coord|36|15|49|N|90|58|24|W|type:city}} (36.263560, -90.973349).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|7.3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} (2.78%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is of the city is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline.<ref name=\"Wormald1991pp60-7\"/> Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.<ref name=\"Wormald1991pp60-7\"/> The major corpus of Medieval Scottish Gaelic poetry, ''[[The Book of the Dean of Lismore]]'' was compiled by the brothers James and Donald MacGregor in the early decades of the sixteenth century. Beside Scottish Gaelic verse it contains a large number of poems composed in Ireland as well as verse and prose in Scots and Latin. The subject matter includes love poetry, heroic ballads and philosophical pieces. It also is notable for containing poetry by at least four women.<ref>J. T. Koch and A.

While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used [[Syllabic verse|syllabic metre]], vernacular poets tended to use [[Accentual verse|stressed metre]]. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,<ref>K. Chedgzoy, ''Women's Writing in the British Atlantic World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|113946714X}}, p. 105.</ref> such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615-1707).<ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7/> [[Iain Lom]] (c. 1624\u2013c. 1710) was a Royalist Scottish Gaelic poet appointed poet laureate in Scotland by Charles II at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]].

The second secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be published was his poetry collection ''Ais-Eiridh na Sean Ch\u00e1noin Albannaich'' (The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Language). His lexicography and poetry was informed by his study of old Gaelic manuscripts, an antiquarian interest which also influenced the orthography he employed. As an observer of the natural world of Scotland and a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebel, Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair was the most overtly nationalist poet in Gaelic of the 18th century. His ''Ais-Eiridh na Sean Ch\u00e1noin Albannaich'' was reported to have been burned in public by the hangman in Edinburgh.<ref name=ScotlandsBooks>{{cite book |last=Crawford  |first=Robert |title=Scotland's Books |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin |location=London|isbn=9780140299403}}</ref> He was influenced by James Thomson's ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' as well as by Gaelic \"village poets\" such as Iain Mac Fhearchair (John MacCodrum). As part of the [[oral literature]] of the Highlands, few of the works of such village poets were published at the time, although some have been collected since.<ref name=ScotlandsBooks />\n\nScottish Gaelic poets produced laments on the Jacobite defeats of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. [[Mairghread nighean Lachlainn]] and [[Catriona Nic Fhearghais]] are among woman poets who reflected on the crushing effects on traditional Gaelic culture of the aftermath of the Jacobite uprisings. A consequent sense of desolation pervaded the works of Scottish Gaelic writers such as [[Dugald Buchanan|Dughall Bochanan]] which mirrored many of the themes of the [[graveyard poets]] writing in England.<ref name=ScotlandsBooks /> A legacy of Jacobite verse was later compiled (and adapted) by [[James Hogg]] in his ''Jacobite Reliques'' (1819).\n\n[[Duncan Ban MacIntyre|Donnchadh B\u00e0n Mac an t-Saoir]] (usually ''Duncan Ban MacIntyre'' in [[English language|English]]; 20 March 1724 &ndash; 14 May 1812)<ref>Calder, George (editor and translator). ''The Gaelic Songs of Duncan MacIntyre.'' Edinburgh: John Grant, 1912.</ref> is one of the most renowned of [[Scottish Gaelic]] poets and formed an integral part of one of the golden ages of Gaelic poetry in Scotland during the 18th century. He is best known for his poem about [[Beinn Dorain]]; \"''Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain''\" ([[English language|English]]: \"Praise of Ben Doran\"). Most of his poetry is descriptive and the influence of Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair is notable in much of it. Despite the Jacobite upheavals during his lifetime, it was his experience as a gamekeeper in [[Argyll]] and [[Perthshire]] in the employ of the [[Duke of Argyll]] which had greatest impact upon his poetry. ''Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain'', stems from this period. The significance of Duncan B\u00e0n's nature themed poetry is such that it has, along with that of MacMhaighstir Alasdair, been described as \"the zenith of Gaelic nature poetry\".<ref>[http://www.gaelicmusic.com/gaelicsong Gaelic Song - An Introduction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===The ''Ossian'' of James Macpherson===\n{{Main|Ossian}}\n[[James Macpherson]] (1736\u201396) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation.

Fionnlagh MacLe\u00f2id's (Finley Macleod) work included ''Ceann Cropic'' (1967), which was strongly influenced by the [[theatre of the absurd]]. Similarly, Donaidh MacIlleathain (Donnie Maclean), made use of absurd dialogue in ''An Sgoil Dhubh'' (''A Dark School'', 1974).

In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used [[Syllabic verse|syllabic metre]], vernacular poets tended to use [[Accentual verse|stressed metre]]. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,<ref>K.

His lexicography and poetry was informed by his study of old Gaelic manuscripts, an antiquarian interest which also influenced the orthography he employed. As an observer of the natural world of Scotland and a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebel, Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair was the most overtly nationalist poet in Gaelic of the 18th century.

He is best known for his poem about [[Beinn Dorain]]; \"''Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain''\" ([[English language|English]]: \"Praise of Ben Doran\"). Most of his poetry is descriptive and the influence of Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair is notable in much of it. Despite the Jacobite upheavals during his lifetime, it was his experience as a gamekeeper in [[Argyll]] and [[Perthshire]] in the employ of the [[Duke of Argyll]] which had greatest impact upon his poetry. ''Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain'', stems from this period. The significance of Duncan B\u00e0n's nature themed poetry is such that it has, along with that of MacMhaighstir Alasdair, been described as \"the zenith of Gaelic nature poetry\".<ref>[http://www.gaelicmusic.com/gaelicsong Gaelic Song - An Introduction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===The ''Ossian'' of James Macpherson===\n{{Main|Ossian}}\n[[James Macpherson]] (1736\u201396) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation.

Amniotes include [[synapsid]]s ([[mammal]]s along with their extinct kin) and [[Sauropsida|sauropsids]] ([[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s), as well as their ancestors, back to amphibians. Amniote embryos, whether laid as eggs or [[Ovoviviparity|carried]] by the female, are protected and aided by several extensive membranes.

Their eggs could survive out of the water, allowing amniotes to branch out into drier environments. The eggs could also \"breathe\" and cope with wastes, allowing the eggs and the amniotes themselves to evolve into larger forms.\n\nThe amniotic egg represents a critical divergence within the vertebrates, one enabling amniotes to reproduce on dry land\u2014free of the need to return to water for reproduction as required of the amphibians. From this point the amniotes spread around the globe, eventually to become the dominant land vertebrates. Very early in their evolutionary history, basal amniotes [[Cladogenesis|diverged into two main lines]], the [[synapsid]]s and the [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]]s, both of which persist into the modern era. The oldest known fossil synapsid is ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]'' from about 312 million years ago,<ref name=B&D>Benton M.J. and Donoghue P.C.J. 2006. Palaeontological evidence to date the tree of life.

Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and a thick stratified [[epithelium]] (rather than first entering a feeding larval [[tadpole]] stage followed by [[Metamorphosis#Amphibian metamorphosis|metamorphosis]], as [[amphibian]]s do). In amniotes, the transition from a two-layered periderm to a [[Cornification|cornified]] epithelium is triggered by [[thyroid hormone]] during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1= Alexander M.

Their [[kidney]]s and [[large intestine]]s are also well-suited to water retention. Most mammals do not lay eggs, but corresponding structures develop inside the [[placenta]].\n\nThe ancestors of true amniotes, such as ''[[Casineria|Casineria kiddi]]'', which lived about 340 million years ago, evolved from [[amphibian]] [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorphs]] and resembled small [[lizards]]. At the late [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]] (360 million years ago), all known tetrapods were essentially aquatic and fish-like. Because the reptiliomorphs were already established 20 million years later when all their fishlike relatives were extinct, it appears they separated from the other tetrapods somewhere during [[Romer's gap]], when the adult tetrapods became fully terrestrial (some forms would later become secondarily aquatic).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/projects/the_mid_palaeozoic_biotic_crisis.page#overview|title= the_mid_palaeozoic_biotic_crisis - Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton - University of Southampton}}</ref> The modest-sized ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, such as depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the Carboniferous swamps and forests; and dry conditions probably do not account for the emergence of the soft shell.<ref>Stewart J.

The amniotic egg formed through a series of evolutionary steps. After [[internal fertilization]] and the habit of laying eggs in terrestrial environments became a reproduction strategy amongst the amniote ancestors, the next major breakthrough appears to have involved a gradual replacement of the gelatinous coating covering the amphibian egg with a fibrous shell membrane. This allowed the egg to increase both its size and in the rate of gas exchange, permitting a larger, metabolically more active embryo to reach full development before hatching. Further developments, like [[extraembryonic membrane]]s (amnion, chorion, and allantois) and a calcified shell, were not essential and probably evolved later.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/shell-game Shell Game \u00bb American Scientist]</ref> It has been suggested that shelled terrestrial eggs without extraembryonic membranes could still not have been more than about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4 inch) in diameter because of diffusion problems, like the inability to get rid of carbon dioxide if the egg was larger. The combination of small eggs and the absence of a larval stage, where posthatching growth occurs in anamniotic tetrapods before turning into juveniles, would limit the size of the adults. This is supported by the fact that extant squamate species that lay eggs less than 1 cm in diameter have adults whose snout-vent length is less than 10 cm. The only way for the eggs to increase in size would be to develop new internal structures specialized for respiration and for waste products. As this happened, it would also affect how much the juveniles could grow before they reached adulthood.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/1177175|title= The evolution of body size, Cope's rule and the origin of amniotes|journal= Systematic Biology|volume= 53|issue= 4|pages= 594\u2013622|author= Michel Laurin|pmid= 15371249|year= 2004|doi= 10.1080/10635150490445706}}</ref>\n\n===The egg membranes===\nFish and amphibian eggs have only one inner membrane, the embryonic membrane. Evolution of the amniote egg required increased exchange of gases and wastes between the embryo and the atmosphere. Structures to permit these traits allowed further adaption that increased the feasible size of amniote eggs and enabled breeding in progressively drier habitats. The increased size of eggs permitted increase in size of offspring and consequently of adults. Further growth for the latter, however, was limited by their position in the terrestrial [[food-chain]], which was restricted to [[Trophic level|level three]] and below, with only [[invertebrate]]s occupying level two. Amniotes would eventually experience [[adaptive radiation]]s when some species evolved the ability to digest plants and new [[ecological niche]]s opened up, permitting larger body-size for herbivores, omnivores and predators.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Amniote traits===\nWhile the early amniotes resembled their amphibian ancestors in many respects, a key difference was the lack of an [[otic notch]] at the back margin of the [[skull roof]]. In their ancestors, this notch held a [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]], an unnecessary structure in an animal without an aquatic larval stage.<ref>Lombard, R. E. & Bolt, J. R.

In [[anapsid]]s, the ancestral condition, there are none, in [[synapsid]]s (mammals and their extinct relatives) there is one, and most [[diapsid]]s (including [[bird]]s, [[crocodilia]]ns, [[Squamata|squamates]], and [[tuatara]]s), have two. Turtles were traditionally classified as anapsids because they lack fenestrae, but molecular testing firmly places them in the diapsid line of descent - they therefore secondarily lost their fenestrae.\n\nPost-cranial remains of amniotes can be identified from their [[Labyrinthodontia|Labyrinthodont]] ancestors by their having at least two pairs of [[sacrum|sacral]] [[rib]]s, a [[sternum]] in the [[pectoral girdle]] (some amniotes have lost it) and an [[Talus bone|astragalus]] bone in the [[ankle]].<ref name=\"gauthieretal1988\"/>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAmniota was first formally described by the embryologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866 on the presence of the [[amnion]], hence the name.

Amniotes lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother, and are distinguished from the [[anamniotes]] ([[fishes]] and [[amphibians]]), which typically lay their eggs in water. Older sources, particularly prior to the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as \"higher vertebrates\" and anamniotes as \"lower vertebrates\", based on the discredited idea of the [[Great chain of being#Scala naturae in evolution|evolutionary great chain of being]].\n\nAmniotes are [[tetrapod]]s (descendants of four-limbed and backboned animals) that are characterised by having an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] equipped with an [[amnion]], an adaptation to lay eggs on land rather than in water as the anamniotes (including frogs) typically do. Amniotes include [[synapsid]]s ([[mammal]]s along with their extinct kin) and [[Sauropsida|sauropsids]] ([[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s), as well as their ancestors, back to amphibians. Amniote embryos, whether laid as eggs or [[Ovoviviparity|carried]] by the female, are protected and aided by several extensive membranes. In [[eutheria]]n mammals (such as humans), these membranes include the [[amniotic sac]] that surrounds the [[Fetus (biology)|fetus]].

Their eggs could survive out of the water, allowing amniotes to branch out into drier environments. The eggs could also \"breathe\" and cope with wastes, allowing the eggs and the amniotes themselves to evolve into larger forms.\n\nThe amniotic egg represents a critical divergence within the vertebrates, one enabling amniotes to reproduce on dry land\u2014free of the need to return to water for reproduction as required of the amphibians. From this point the amniotes spread around the globe, eventually to become the dominant land vertebrates. Very early in their evolutionary history, basal amniotes [[Cladogenesis|diverged into two main lines]], the [[synapsid]]s and the [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]]s, both of which persist into the modern era. The oldest known fossil synapsid is ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]'' from about 312 million years ago,<ref name=B&D>Benton M.J. and Donoghue P.C.J. 2006. Palaeontological evidence to date the tree of life.

Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and a thick stratified [[epithelium]] (rather than first entering a feeding larval [[tadpole]] stage followed by [[Metamorphosis#Amphibian metamorphosis|metamorphosis]], as [[amphibian]]s do). In amniotes, the transition from a two-layered periderm to a [[Cornification|cornified]] epithelium is triggered by [[thyroid hormone]] during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1= Alexander M.

Their [[kidney]]s and [[large intestine]]s are also well-suited to water retention. Most mammals do not lay eggs, but corresponding structures develop inside the [[placenta]].\n\nThe ancestors of true amniotes, such as ''[[Casineria|Casineria kiddi]]'', which lived about 340 million years ago, evolved from [[amphibian]] [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorphs]] and resembled small [[lizards]]. At the late [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]] (360 million years ago), all known tetrapods were essentially aquatic and fish-like. Because the reptiliomorphs were already established 20 million years later when all their fishlike relatives were extinct, it appears they separated from the other tetrapods somewhere during [[Romer's gap]], when the adult tetrapods became fully terrestrial (some forms would later become secondarily aquatic).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/projects/the_mid_palaeozoic_biotic_crisis.page#overview|title= the_mid_palaeozoic_biotic_crisis - Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton - University of Southampton}}</ref> The modest-sized ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, such as depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the Carboniferous swamps and forests; and dry conditions probably do not account for the emergence of the soft shell.<ref>Stewart J.

The amniotic egg formed through a series of evolutionary steps. After [[internal fertilization]] and the habit of laying eggs in terrestrial environments became a reproduction strategy amongst the amniote ancestors, the next major breakthrough appears to have involved a gradual replacement of the gelatinous coating covering the amphibian egg with a fibrous shell membrane. This allowed the egg to increase both its size and in the rate of gas exchange, permitting a larger, metabolically more active embryo to reach full development before hatching. Further developments, like [[extraembryonic membrane]]s (amnion, chorion, and allantois) and a calcified shell, were not essential and probably evolved later.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/shell-game Shell Game \u00bb American Scientist]</ref> It has been suggested that shelled terrestrial eggs without extraembryonic membranes could still not have been more than about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4 inch) in diameter because of diffusion problems, like the inability to get rid of carbon dioxide if the egg was larger. The combination of small eggs and the absence of a larval stage, where posthatching growth occurs in anamniotic tetrapods before turning into juveniles, would limit the size of the adults. This is supported by the fact that extant squamate species that lay eggs less than 1 cm in diameter have adults whose snout-vent length is less than 10 cm. The only way for the eggs to increase in size would be to develop new internal structures specialized for respiration and for waste products. As this happened, it would also affect how much the juveniles could grow before they reached adulthood.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= https://www.academia.edu/1177175|title= The evolution of body size, Cope's rule and the origin of amniotes|journal= Systematic Biology|volume= 53|issue= 4|pages= 594\u2013622|author= Michel Laurin|pmid= 15371249|year= 2004|doi= 10.1080/10635150490445706}}</ref>\n\n===The egg membranes===\nFish and amphibian eggs have only one inner membrane, the embryonic membrane. Evolution of the amniote egg required increased exchange of gases and wastes between the embryo and the atmosphere. Structures to permit these traits allowed further adaption that increased the feasible size of amniote eggs and enabled breeding in progressively drier habitats. The increased size of eggs permitted increase in size of offspring and consequently of adults. Further growth for the latter, however, was limited by their position in the terrestrial [[food-chain]], which was restricted to [[Trophic level|level three]] and below, with only [[invertebrate]]s occupying level two. Amniotes would eventually experience [[adaptive radiation]]s when some species evolved the ability to digest plants and new [[ecological niche]]s opened up, permitting larger body-size for herbivores, omnivores and predators.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Amniote traits===\nWhile the early amniotes resembled their amphibian ancestors in many respects, a key difference was the lack of an [[otic notch]] at the back margin of the [[skull roof]]. In their ancestors, this notch held a [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]], an unnecessary structure in an animal without an aquatic larval stage.<ref>Lombard, R. E. & Bolt, J. R.

''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'' No 11: pp 19\u201376 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1979.tb00027.x/abstract Abstract]</ref> There are three main lines of amniotes, which may be distinguished by the structure of the [[skull]] and in particular the number of [[temporal fenestra]]e (openings) behind each eye. In [[anapsid]]s, the ancestral condition, there are none, in [[synapsid]]s (mammals and their extinct relatives) there is one, and most [[diapsid]]s (including [[bird]]s, [[crocodilia]]ns, [[Squamata|squamates]], and [[tuatara]]s), have two. Turtles were traditionally classified as anapsids because they lack fenestrae, but molecular testing firmly places them in the diapsid line of descent - they therefore secondarily lost their fenestrae.\n\nPost-cranial remains of amniotes can be identified from their [[Labyrinthodontia|Labyrinthodont]] ancestors by their having at least two pairs of [[sacrum|sacral]] [[rib]]s, a [[sternum]] in the [[pectoral girdle]] (some amniotes have lost it) and an [[Talus bone|astragalus]] bone in the [[ankle]].<ref name=\"gauthieretal1988\"/>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAmniota was first formally described by the embryologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866 on the presence of the [[amnion]], hence the name.

Unlike Benton, for example, [[Jacques Gauthier]] and colleagues forwarded a definition of Amniota in 1988 as \"the most recent common ancestor of [[extant taxon|extant]] mammals and reptiles, and all its descendants\".<ref name=\"gauthieretal1988\">Gauthier, J., Kluge, A.G. and Rowe, T.

Later in 1995, the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]]. This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000. Omnipoint was later acquired by VoiceStream Wireless, which eventually became part of [[T-Mobile USA]].\n\n===Partnerships and more consolidation===\nIn September 1996, Sprint announced a deal with [[RadioShack]], and in 1997, Sprint stores opened at RadioShack to offer communications services and products across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/RadioShack-Sprint-Team-Up-Phone-outlets-to-2805441.php|title=RadioShack, Sprint Team Up / Phone outlets to open today inside retailer|last=Marshall|first=Jonathan|date=September 24, 1997|website=SFGate|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint and [[MCI WorldCom]] announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/10/05/worldbiz/sprint_mci/|title=MCI buys Sprint for $129B - Oct. 5, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Later in 1995, the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]]. This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000. Omnipoint was later acquired by VoiceStream Wireless, which eventually became part of [[T-Mobile USA]].\n\n===Partnerships and more consolidation===\nIn September 1996, Sprint announced a deal with [[RadioShack]], and in 1997, Sprint stores opened at RadioShack to offer communications services and products across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/RadioShack-Sprint-Team-Up-Phone-outlets-to-2805441.php|title=RadioShack, Sprint Team Up / Phone outlets to open today inside retailer|last=Marshall|first=Jonathan|date=September 24, 1997|website=SFGate|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint and [[MCI WorldCom]] announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/10/05/worldbiz/sprint_mci/|title=MCI buys Sprint for $129B - Oct. 5, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

Sprint is in the process of upgrading these services from a TDM network to an IP based network<ref>http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0824/DA-16-963A1.pdf</ref>\n\n==Wireless operations==\n[[File:Sprint store on TV Highway - Hillsboro, Oregon.JPG|thumb|This \"Sprint Store by ccComm\" located in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]] sells Sprint-branded wireless products and services exclusively.]]\n\n===Sprint branded services===\nSprint Corporation offers postpaid wireless voice and data services primarily under the Sprint brand.\n\n=== Sprint Prepaid Group ===\nThe Sprint Prepaid Group is a division of the company formed in May 2010 that is responsible for the operations of Sprint's pre-pay subsidiaries. SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Langan had been lodging nearby to Odin's and when the proprietor, James Benson, was killed in an accident in 1966, he took over the kitchen for Benson's wife, Kirsten. Langan transformed Odin's in both its style of cuisine and its decor. [[Patrick Procktor]], an artist who lived near and later married Kirsten Benson, provided a number of watercolours to hang on the walls of Odin's alongside the works of other artists encouraged to 'eat down' their work. After purchasing Benson's share of Odin's, Langan created a larger Odin's at the premises next door in Devonshire Street. Opening early in 1973, the larger Odin's maintained the tradition of serving hearty cuisine in an environment surrounded by original artworks. Odin's quickly became a very popular dining location and proved profitable enough to permit Langan to embark on what became his most successful venture, Langan's Brasserie.\n\nPeter Langan wanted to bring Parisienne cafe society to London and chose the former site of Le Coq d'Or restaurant in Stratton Street, Mayfair as its location. [[Michael Caine]], a customer and friend of Peter Langan, became his business partner and the pair transformed the site with original artwork, brighter lighting with mis-matched lamps and relaxed the atmosphere of the restaurant (there was no dress code for diners). Richard Shepherd, the former head chef at the [[Michelin star]]red [[Capital Hotel, London|Capital Hotel]] in London, joined the Caine and Langan partnership in 1977 and introduced a menu that has changed little since.

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 20,007.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06063.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The [[county seat]] is [[Quincy, California|Quincy]],<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> and the only incorporated city is [[Portola, California|Portola]]. The largest community in the county is [[East Quincy, California|East Quincy]]. The county was named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''R\u00edo de las Plumas'' (the [[Feather River]]), which flows through the county.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, the indigenous [[Mountain Maidu]] were the primary inhabitants of the area now known as Plumas County. The Maidu lived in small settlements along the edges of valleys, subsisting on roots, acorns, grasses, seeds, and occasionally fish and big game. They were decentralized and had no tribal leadership; most bands lived along waterways in and around their own valleys. Areas with high snowfall, including the Mohawk and [[Sierra Valley|Sierra]] valleys, were hunting grounds for game in the warmer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plumascounty.org/Misc_Pages/Useful_Info_and_Links/History.htm|title=Official visitor information for Plumas County, Northern California|website=Plumascounty.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyofplumas.com/index.aspx?NID=254|title=Plumas County, CA - Official Website - Northern Maidu|website=Countyofplumas.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, European Americans discovered gold in the Sierra foothills. Miners were attracted to Plumas County in particular, largely due to the tales of Thomas Stoddard, who claimed to have discovered a lake lined with gold nuggets while lost in the wilderness. Gold-hungry prospectors flooded into the area. Though hopeful miners scoured the glacial lakes (now designated as the Lakes Basin Recreation Area) for months, they did not find the purported lake of gold.\n\nBut some had success panning for gold in the rivers and creeks in the area, and created squatters' villages, the first non-Native American settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ptBv9l5uSPwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA6&dq=plumas+county+history&ots=Z_ZT4MHWpC&sig=DIoGqxKdwvIA5VKpD7npH77F8Ng#v=onepage&q=stoddard&f=false|title=Plumas County: History of the Feather River Region|first=Jim|last=Young|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Arcadia|accessdate=7 November 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRough shanty towns quickly sprang up around successful mining areas, including Rich Bar, Indian Bar, and Rabbit Creek (now [[La Porte, California|La Porte]]). Many were developed adjacent to the [[Feather River]], named by Spanish explorer Captain Luis Arguello as ''R\u00edo de las Plumas'' in 1820.\n\nIn 1850 notable African-American frontiersman [[James Beckwourth]] discovered the lowest pass through the Sierras, which became known as [[Beckwourth Pass]]. Using the pass, he blazed a trail that began in Western Nevada and went through much of Plumas County, eventually terminating in the Sacramento Valley.<ref name=\"plumasmuseum.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.plumasmuseum.org/pchist.html|title=PCMA|website=Plumasmuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> This trail was followed by many erstwhile miners into Plumas County. Beckwourth also set up a trading post in the western Sierra Valley that still stands today. Though the Beckwourth Trail was longer than the original emigrant trail that ran south of Plumas County, its lower elevations extended its seasonal use when the higher trail was snowbound and impassable. The Beckwourth Trail had heavy use until about 1865, after construction of the transcontinental railroad, when railroads became the favored transportation method for westward-bound travelers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckwourth.org/Trail/|title=The Jim Beckwourth Trail|website=Beckwourth.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlumas County was formed in 1854 during a meeting of three commissioners held at the [[American Ranch]] in Quincy. It was carved from the eastern portion of [[Butte County, California|Butte County]]. [[Quincy, California|Quincy]], originally a mining town, was chosen as the county seat after an early settler donated a plot of land there to establish the seat. Once it became the seat, nearby [[Elizabethtown, California|Elizabethtown]] faded and ultimately became defunct. In 1864, the state legislature took a large portion of Plumas County to organize [[Lassen County]] because of increasing population. Shortly afterward Plumas County annexed part of [[Sierra County, California|Sierra County]], including the prosperous mining town of La Porte.\n\nOver the next decades, different industries drove the growth of the various settlements that sprung up around the county. [[Greenville, California|Greenville]] began as a mining and farming community in Indian Valley in the late 1850s. [[Chester, California|Chester]] was formed near the area that is now [[Lake Almanor, California|Lake Almanor]], as a result of cattle ranching and the timber industry.\n\nWhen the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] was constructed in 1910, [[Portola, California|Portola]] developed as an important railroad stop. Thanks to the railroad, Plumas County could export its lumber beyond the local area, and the timber industry became dominant in the county's economy for decades. As the railroad route extended up the [[Feather River Canyon]], it was also used by the area's first tourists and sightseers. When the [[Feather River Highway]] was completed in 1937, through federal investment in infrastructure by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]], Plumas County became linked to the Sacramento Valley year-round thanks to the route's low elevation.<ref name=\"plumasmuseum.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|2613|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|2553|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|60|sqmi}} (2.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=October 3, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\nPlumas County is located in the far northern end of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada range]].

[[California]], [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 20,007.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06063.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The [[county seat]] is [[Quincy, California|Quincy]],<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> and the only incorporated city is [[Portola, California|Portola]]. The largest community in the county is [[East Quincy, California|East Quincy]]. The county was named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''R\u00edo de las Plumas'' (the [[Feather River]]), which flows through the county.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, the indigenous [[Mountain Maidu]] were the primary inhabitants of the area now known as Plumas County. The Maidu lived in small settlements along the edges of valleys, subsisting on roots, acorns, grasses, seeds, and occasionally fish and big game. They were decentralized and had no tribal leadership; most bands lived along waterways in and around their own valleys. Areas with high snowfall, including the Mohawk and [[Sierra Valley|Sierra]] valleys, were hunting grounds for game in the warmer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plumascounty.org/Misc_Pages/Useful_Info_and_Links/History.htm|title=Official visitor information for Plumas County, Northern California|website=Plumascounty.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyofplumas.com/index.aspx?NID=254|title=Plumas County, CA - Official Website - Northern Maidu|website=Countyofplumas.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, European Americans discovered gold in the Sierra foothills. Miners were attracted to Plumas County in particular, largely due to the tales of Thomas Stoddard, who claimed to have discovered a lake lined with gold nuggets while lost in the wilderness. Gold-hungry prospectors flooded into the area. Though hopeful miners scoured the glacial lakes (now designated as the Lakes Basin Recreation Area) for months, they did not find the purported lake of gold.\n\nBut some had success panning for gold in the rivers and creeks in the area, and created squatters' villages, the first non-Native American settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ptBv9l5uSPwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA6&dq=plumas+county+history&ots=Z_ZT4MHWpC&sig=DIoGqxKdwvIA5VKpD7npH77F8Ng#v=onepage&q=stoddard&f=false|title=Plumas County: History of the Feather River Region|first=Jim|last=Young|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Arcadia|accessdate=7 November 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRough shanty towns quickly sprang up around successful mining areas, including Rich Bar, Indian Bar, and Rabbit Creek (now [[La Porte, California|La Porte]]). Many were developed adjacent to the [[Feather River]], named by Spanish explorer Captain Luis Arguello as ''R\u00edo de las Plumas'' in 1820.\n\nIn 1850 notable African-American frontiersman [[James Beckwourth]] discovered the lowest pass through the Sierras, which became known as [[Beckwourth Pass]]. Using the pass, he blazed a trail that began in Western Nevada and went through much of Plumas County, eventually terminating in the Sacramento Valley.<ref name=\"plumasmuseum.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.plumasmuseum.org/pchist.html|title=PCMA|website=Plumasmuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> This trail was followed by many erstwhile miners into Plumas County. Beckwourth also set up a trading post in the western Sierra Valley that still stands today. Though the Beckwourth Trail was longer than the original emigrant trail that ran south of Plumas County, its lower elevations extended its seasonal use when the higher trail was snowbound and impassable. The Beckwourth Trail had heavy use until about 1865, after construction of the transcontinental railroad, when railroads became the favored transportation method for westward-bound travelers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckwourth.org/Trail/|title=The Jim Beckwourth Trail|website=Beckwourth.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlumas County was formed in 1854 during a meeting of three commissioners held at the [[American Ranch]] in Quincy. It was carved from the eastern portion of [[Butte County, California|Butte County]]. [[Quincy, California|Quincy]], originally a mining town, was chosen as the county seat after an early settler donated a plot of land there to establish the seat. Once it became the seat, nearby [[Elizabethtown, California|Elizabethtown]] faded and ultimately became defunct. In 1864, the state legislature took a large portion of Plumas County to organize [[Lassen County]] because of increasing population. Shortly afterward Plumas County annexed part of [[Sierra County, California|Sierra County]], including the prosperous mining town of La Porte.\n\nOver the next decades, different industries drove the growth of the various settlements that sprung up around the county. [[Greenville, California|Greenville]] began as a mining and farming community in Indian Valley in the late 1850s. [[Chester, California|Chester]] was formed near the area that is now [[Lake Almanor, California|Lake Almanor]], as a result of cattle ranching and the timber industry.\n\nWhen the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] was constructed in 1910, [[Portola, California|Portola]] developed as an important railroad stop. Thanks to the railroad, Plumas County could export its lumber beyond the local area, and the timber industry became dominant in the county\u2019s economy for decades. As the railroad route extended up the [[Feather River Canyon]], it was also used by the area\u2019s first tourists and sightseers. When the [[Feather River Highway]] was completed in 1937, through federal investment in infrastructure by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]], Plumas County became linked to the Sacramento Valley year-round thanks to the route\u2019s low elevation.<ref name=\"plumasmuseum.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|2613|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|2553|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|60|sqmi}} (2.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=October 3, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\nPlumas County is located in the far northern end of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada range]].
