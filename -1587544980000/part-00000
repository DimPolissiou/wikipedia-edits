This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100&nbsp;million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8&nbsp;billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s, although weather patterns evolve earlier.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2010}}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.
