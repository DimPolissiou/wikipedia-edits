[[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while awaiting trial or after sentencing.\n\nWhile house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored.\n\n==History==\nJudges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Authorities often used house arrest to confine political leaders who were deposed in a coup d'\u00e9tat, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.\n\nThis method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities.  Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded!

It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.<ref name=lev>Levinson, David. (2002).

Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref>Spohn, Cassia.

Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.<ref>Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}</ref>\n\nThe types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. \"Home confinement\" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is \"home incarceration\", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref name=lev/>\n\nIn some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.<ref>Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}</ref> In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm \"Q&A: Terrorism laws\"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006</ref> In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.\n\n==Using technology for enforcement==\nIn some countries, house arrest is enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits an [[RF]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.\n\nIf the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal.  The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.<ref>http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.\n\nAnother method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.\n\n[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.\n\n==Notable instances==\n\n===Algeria===\n* [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], former [[Heads of State of Algeria|President of Algeria]], deposed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] in 1965.

She was convicted and jailed for the third time under house arrest for her criticism of the government following the infamous [[Depayin Massacre]] in 2003. After her 14th year of prison, she was released to her dilapidated home in Rangoonhe.

After the Iran Revolution she was under a 21-year ban from performing and was assumed to be under house arrest for much of the time.\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, house arrest (in Italian ''arresti domiciliari'') is a common practice of [[Remand (detention)|detaining suspects]], as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.\n\nNotable cases:\n* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).\n* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.\n* [[Silvia Baraldini]], activist of [[Black Liberation Army]] in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist [[Assata Shakur]], and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons.\n* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.\n\n===New Zealand===\nAt sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.\n\nElectronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. {{as of|2015}} over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance.\n\n*[[Phil Rudd]], two-time drummer with Australian rock legends [[AC/DC]], was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in [[Tauranga]] for charges relating to [[methamphetamine]] possession and making [[death threats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/acdcs-phil-rudd-sentenced-to-house-detention-for-eight-months-201597|title=AC/DC's Phil Rudd Sentenced to House Detention for Eight Months|work=Us Weekly}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n* [[Shehu Shagari]], [[President of Nigeria]] was placed under house arrest on December 31, 1983, following a military coup which ousted his government (see: [[Nigerian Second Republic]]).\n* [[Muhammadu Buhari|General Muhammadu Buhari]], [[President of Nigeria|Military Head of State]] was confined to his residence following the palace coup which ejected him from office.\n* [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola|MKO Abiola]], was placed under house arrest after he declared himself the rightful winner of the 1993 [[Nigerian Third Republic|presidential elections]], against the wishes of the [[Ibrahim Babangida]] military junta.

[[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while awaiting trial or after sentencing.\n\nWhile house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored.\n\n==History==\nJudges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Authorities often used house arrest to confine political leaders who were deposed in a coup d'\u00e9tat, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.\n\nThis method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities.  Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded! How do you qualify for house arrest? |author=Juliet Lapidos |date=January 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Details==\nHome detention is an alternative to [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.<ref name=lev>Levinson, David. (2002).

Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref>Spohn, Cassia.

Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.<ref>Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}</ref>\n\nThe types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. \"Home confinement\" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is \"home incarceration\", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref name=lev/>\n\nIn some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.<ref>Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}</ref> In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm \"Q&A: Terrorism laws\"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006</ref> In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.\n\n==Using technology for enforcement==\nIn some countries, house arrest is enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits an [[RF]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.\n\nIf the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal.  The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.<ref>http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.\n\nAnother method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.\n\n[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.\n\n==Notable instances==\n\n===Algeria===\n* [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], former [[Heads of State of Algeria|President of Algeria]], deposed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8nne]] in 1965.

She was convicted and jailed for the third time under house arrest for her criticism of the government following the infamous [[Depayin Massacre]] in 2003. After her 14th year of prison, she was released to her dilapidated home in Rangoonhe.

As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.\n\nNotable cases:\n* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).\n* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.\n* [[Silvia Baraldini]], activist of [[Black Liberation Army]] in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist [[Assata Shakur]], and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons.\n* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.\n\n===New Zealand===\nAt sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.\n\nElectronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas.

Native in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she was able to interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four of them even without preparation), and she translated technical literature and read [[belles-lettres]] in six languages. {{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}She was able to understand journalism in further eleven languages. As she put it, altogether she earned money with sixteen languages ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. She learned these languages mostly by self-effort, as an [[autodidact]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Her aims to acquire these languages were most of all practical, to satisfy her interest.\n\nAccording to her own account, her long life was highlighted not primarily by the command of languages but the actual study of them{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Through her books, published in Hungarian in several editions as well as in some other languages, interviews (in print and on the air) and conversations, she tried to share this joy with generations. As an interpreter, she visited five continents, saw forty countries, and reported about her experiences and adventures in a separate book (''Egy tolm\u00e1cs a vil\u00e1g k\u00f6r\u00fcl'', \"An interpreter around the world\"){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n== Her command of specific languages ==\n* In the interview given to ''Hetek'' newspaper (1998),<ref>November 14, 1998, [http://hetek.hu/eletmod/199811/a_nyelvekrol_jut_eszembe Full interview in Hungarian]</ref> she lists the following as the 16 languages she earned money with:\n:English, Bulgarian, Danish, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese, Latin, Polish, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Spanish, Slovak, and Ukrainian.\n* In the foreword to the first edition of her book ''How I Learn Languages'' (1970), she says:<ref>Quoted in the English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, pages viii and xvii.</ref>\n:\u201cI only have one mother tongue: Hungarian. Russian, English, French, and German live inside me simultaneously with Hungarian. I can switch between any of these languages with great ease, from one word to the next.\n:Translating texts in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish generally requires me to spend about half a day brushing up on my language skills and perusing the material to be translated.\n:The other six languages I know only through translating literature and technical material.\u201d\n*In the fourth edition of her book ''How I Learn Languages'' (1995), she writes:<ref>Hungarian edition, 1995, p. 29; English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, p. 49</ref>\n:\u201cI would simply like to tell how I, over 25 years, got to the point of being able to speak 10 languages, translate technical documents and enjoy fiction in six more, and understand written journalism in 11 more or so.\u201d\n*In her book ''Harmony of Babel'' (1988), she writes:<ref>Hungarian edition: 1988, page 137; [http://tesl-ej.org/pdf/ej66/TESL-EJ_HarmonyOfBabel.pdf English translation], p. 138</ref>\n:\u201cHow many languages do I speak? I have only one mother tongue: Hungarian. I speak Russian, German, English, and French well enough to be able to interpret or translate between any of them extemporaneously. I have to prepare a bit for Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish. At such times I leaf through the parts of my diaries written in these languages. I can read Swedish, Norwegian, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch, Bulgarian, and Czech literature; I can translate their written\u2014political or technical\u2014texts.\u201d\n\nAs it can be seen, Danish, Hebrew, Latin, Slovak, and Ukrainian are mentioned only in the ''Hetek'' interview, whereas Czech, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish are only in the ''Harmony of Babel.'' (Although Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are close to each other, as well as Czech and Slovak, or Portuguese and Spanish, or Ukrainian and Russian are.) The languages listed at all places:\n* in the first place, English, German, French, and Russian (of course apart from her native Hungarian) \u2013 five languages in which she professed to be truly proficient;\n* in the second place, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish \u2013 five more languages, in which she was able to interpret too (after some preparation);\n* additionally, at a lower level, Romanian and Bulgarian;\n* and apart from these, five more languages are mentioned at both places (see above); which gives altogether 22 languages.\n\nIn ''Polyglot: How I Learn Languages,'' she refers to more languages she also understood. Including these, she claimed to know at least 28 languages (including Hungarian) at least at a level enabling her to comprehend written texts, out of which languages she was able to interpret in 10.\n\nAccording to her account, she acquired the languages above in this order: French (at elementary school, at the age of approx. 10\u201314); Latin (before and/or partly during her university studies); English (from 1933, on her own; this was when she developed her subsequent method of learning languages); Russian (from 1941, on her own; enabled her to understand Ukrainian, as well as Bulgarian at some extent); Romanian (on her own); Chinese (approx. from 1950, in two years, at a university course<ref>More information in Hungarian about her studies: [http://kinaiszak.elte.hu/index.php/a-tanszek-toertenete The history of the (Chinese) Department]</ref>); Polish (around 1955, at a course); Japanese (from 1956, on her own); Czech (1954, on her own; similar to Slovak); Italian (on her own, after some antecedents in the 1940s); Spanish (in the second half of the 1960, on her own); German.<ref>''\u00cdgy tanulok nyelveket'' [How I Learn Languages], 1st edition, ''El\u0151sz\u00f3'' [Foreword], pp. 5\u201322. Years can often be inferred from the text.</ref>\n\n== Her language learning method and principles==\n<center>{{math|<big>{{sfrac|Invested Time \u00d7 Motivation|Inhibition}}</big> {{=}} Result}}&nbsp;<ref>Kat\u00f3 Lomb (2010). 2nd ed. ''Polyglot: How I Learn Languages.'' Berkeley: TESL-EJ. P. 176</ref></center>\n\nHer keyword was most of all ''[[interest]]'': the word, coming from Latin ''interesse'' (originally meaning \"to be between\"), has a double meaning, referring to the material profit or the mental attraction, together: ''[[motivation]]''. This means that I can answer these questions: \"How much am I interested in it? What do I want with it? What does it mean for me? What good is it for me?\" She didn't believe in the so-called language talent. She tended to express the language skill and its fruitfulness with a fraction, with ''motivation'' in the numerator (as well as ''invested time,'' although if there is true motivation, one can pinch off some ten minutes a day even with the busiest job), and ''inhibition'' in the denominator (the fear of starting to speak, of being clumsy, of being laughed at). In her conviction, the stronger the motivation is within us, and the more we can put aside inhibition, the sooner we can take possession of the language.\n\nAs she put it, she drove three ''[[automobile|auto]]''s in the world of languages, namely autolexia, autographia and autologia. (Out of the elements of these words, coming from Greek, ''auto-'' means ''self'', and ''&#8209;lexia'', ''&#8209;graphia'' and ''&#8209;logia'' refers to reading, writing and speaking respectively.) ''Autolexia'' means reading for myself: the book I discover by myself, which provides novelties again and again, which I can take with me anywhere, which won't get tired of being asked questions. ''Autographia'' means writing for myself, when I try to write about my thoughts, experiences, everyday things in the very language I'm just learning, no matter if it's silly, no matter if it's incorrect, no matter if a word or two is left out. ''Autologia'' means speaking with myself, when I try to express my thoughts or what I see on the street in the language I'm studying, when I keep on chatting to myself.\n\nEven she was bored with the fabricated dialogues of coursebooks, so her favourite method was to obtain an original novel in a language completely unknown to her, whose topic she personally found interesting (a detective story, a love story, or even a technical description would do), and that was how she deciphered, unravelled the basics of the language: the essence of the grammar and the most important words. She didn't let herself be set back by rare or complicated expressions: she skipped them, saying: what is important will sooner or later emerge again and will explain itself if necessary. (\"It's much more of a problem if the book becomes flavourless in our hands due to the many interruptions than not learning if the inspector watches the murderer from behind a blackthorn or a hawthorn.\")<!-- \u00cdgy tanulok nyelveket, 1995, p. 63. --> So we don't really need to look up each and every word in the dictionary: it only spoils our mood from the joy of reading and discovering the texts. In any case, what we can remember is what we have figured out ourselves. For this purpose, she always bought her own copies of books, since while reading she wrote on the edge of the pages what she had understood from the text by herself. This way one cannot avoid picking up something of a language\u2014as one can't rest until one has learnt who the murderer is, or whether the girl says yes in the end. (This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, [[Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi]] as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.)\n\nAnother keyword of hers was ''[[wiktionary:context|context]]'' (she was playfully called ''Kati Kontext'' herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don't understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered (which is perhaps the best possible way of learning), or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. ''high wind'', ''keen wind''), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kat\u00f3 Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, \"shoemaker's lasts\" or \"cookie-cutters\" elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an [[idiom]], elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures.\n\nShe didn't let herself be put off from her set objective by mistakes, failures or the ceaseless demand of perfection, but she always clung to the joyful, enjoyable side of language studies\u2014maybe that's where her success lay. She besieged the fortress of language again and again in a thousand and one ways. Her saying may be useful for those less confident of themselves: \"Language is the only thing worth knowing even poorly\" (in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: \"A nyelv az egyetlen, amit rosszul is \u00e9rdemes tudni\").\n\n==Quotes==\n:''Szilard Kato, the daughter of a prominent local physician, was born and raised in Pecs, where she went to the University to earn her degrees. She moved to Budapest after age 21, where she met and married Laub (later the family changed the name to Lomb) Frigyes, an engineer from a prominent family of electrical engineers. As a young adult, she became interested in other languages while in the family's bomb shelter as Russian troops were advancing on Budapest. She was quoted by her family as having said the following: \"Kids, we are going to have to learn Russian now...\". She managed to acquire a Russian typewriter and started learning the language. This single step started her on the road to a long and illustrious career in languages. As the Russian occupation unfolded, she served for a time as the translator for the Russian Commander of Budapest. In later years she became a professional interpreter. She acquired high levels of proficiency in 17 languages without extended stays in the countries where the languages were spoken. I interviewed Dr. Lomb (her PhD was in Chemistry) in depth ten years ago in Budapest. She attributed her success to massive amounts of comprehensible input, mostly through recreational reading. She was personally very interested in grammar and linguistics but felt they played a small role in language acquisition, loved dictionaries but looked up words when she read only if the word re-appeared several times and she still did not understand it, and hated to be corrected: \"Error correction makes you sick to your stomach.\"''\n:''References:''\n:''Krashen, S. and Kiss, N. 1996.

Native in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she was able to interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four of them even without preparation), and she translated technical literature and read [[belles-lettres]] in six languages. {{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}She was able to understand journalism in further eleven languages. As she put it, altogether she earned money with sixteen languages ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. She learned these languages mostly by self-effort, as an [[autodidact]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Her aims to acquire these languages were most of all practical, to satisfy her interest.\n\nAccording to her own account, her long life was highlighted not primarily by the command of languages but the actual study of them{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Through her books, published in Hungarian in several editions as well as in some other languages, interviews (in print and on the air) and conversations, she tried to share this joy with generations. As an interpreter, she visited five continents, saw forty countries, and reported about her experiences and adventures in a separate book (''Egy tolm\u00e1cs a vil\u00e1g k\u00f6r\u00fcl'', \"An interpreter around the world\"){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n== Her command of specific languages ==\n* In the interview given to ''Hetek'' newspaper (1998),<ref>November 14, 1998, [http://hetek.hu/eletmod/199811/a_nyelvekrol_jut_eszembe Full interview in Hungarian]</ref> she lists the following as the 16 languages she earned money with:\n:English, Bulgarian, Danish, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese, Latin, Polish, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Spanish, Slovak, and Ukrainian.\n* In the foreword to the first edition of her book ''How I Learn Languages'' (1970), she says:<ref>Quoted in the English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, pages viii and xvii.</ref>\n:\u201cI only have one mother tongue: Hungarian. Russian, English, French, and German live inside me simultaneously with Hungarian. I can switch between any of these languages with great ease, from one word to the next.\n:Translating texts in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish generally requires me to spend about half a day brushing up on my language skills and perusing the material to be translated.\n:The other six languages I know only through translating literature and technical material.\u201d\n*In the fourth edition of her book ''How I Learn Languages'' (1995), she writes:<ref>Hungarian edition, 1995, p. 29; English translation, 2nd ed., 2008, p. 49</ref>\n:\u201cI would simply like to tell how I, over 25 years, got to the point of being able to speak 10 languages, translate technical documents and enjoy fiction in six more, and understand written journalism in 11 more or so.\u201d\n*In her book ''Harmony of Babel'' (1988), she writes:<ref>Hungarian edition: 1988, page 137; [http://tesl-ej.org/pdf/ej66/TESL-EJ_HarmonyOfBabel.pdf English translation], p. 138</ref>\n:\u201cHow many languages do I speak? I have only one mother tongue: Hungarian. I speak Russian, German, English, and French well enough to be able to interpret or translate between any of them extemporaneously. I have to prepare a bit for Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish. At such times I leaf through the parts of my diaries written in these languages. I can read Swedish, Norwegian, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch, Bulgarian, and Czech literature; I can translate their written\u2014political or technical\u2014texts.\u201d\n\nAs it can be seen, Danish, Hebrew, Latin, Slovak, and Ukrainian are mentioned only in the ''Hetek'' interview, whereas Czech, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish are only in the ''Harmony of Babel.'' (Although Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are close to each other, as well as Czech and Slovak, or Portuguese and Spanish, or Ukrainian and Russian are.) The languages listed at all places:\n* in the first place, English, German, French, and Russian (of course apart from her native Hungarian) \u2013 five languages in which she professed to be truly proficient;\n* in the second place, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish \u2013 five more languages, in which she was able to interpret too (after some preparation);\n* additionally, at a lower level, Romanian and Bulgarian;\n* and apart from these, five more languages are mentioned at both places (see above); which gives altogether 22 languages.\n\nIn ''Polyglot: How I Learn Languages,'' she refers to more languages she also understood. Including these, she claimed to know at least 28 languages (including Hungarian) at least at a level enabling her to comprehend written texts, out of which languages she was able to interpret in 10.\n\nAccording to her account, she acquired the languages above in this order: French (at elementary school, at the age of approx. 10\u201314); Latin (before and/or partly during her university studies); English (from 1933, on her own; this was when she developed her subsequent method of learning languages); Russian (from 1941, on her own; enabled her to understand Ukrainian, as well as Bulgarian at some extent); Romanian (on her own); Chinese (approx. from 1950, in two years, at a university course<ref>More information in Hungarian about her studies: [http://kinaiszak.elte.hu/index.php/a-tanszek-toertenete The history of the (Chinese) Department]</ref>); Polish (around 1955, at a course); Japanese (from 1956, on her own); Czech (1954, on her own; similar to Slovak); Italian (on her own, after some antecedents in the 1940s); Spanish (in the second half of the 1960, on her own); German.<ref>''\u00cdgy tanulok nyelveket'' [How I Learn Languages], 1st edition, ''El\u0151sz\u00f3'' [Foreword], pp. 5\u201322. Years can often be inferred from the text.</ref>\n\n== Her language learning method and principles==\n<center>{{math|<big>{{sfrac|Invested Time \u00d7 Motivation|Inhibition}}</big> {{=}} Result}}&nbsp;<ref>Kat\u00f3 Lomb (2010). 2nd ed. ''Polyglot: How I Learn Languages.'' Berkeley: TESL-EJ. P. 176</ref></center>\n\nHer keyword was most of all ''[[interest]]'': the word, coming from Latin ''interesse'' (originally meaning \"to be between\"), has a double meaning, referring to the material profit or the mental attraction, together: ''[[motivation]]''. This means that I can answer these questions: \"How much am I interested in it? What do I want with it? What does it mean for me? What good is it for me?\" She didn't believe in the so-called language talent. She tended to express the language skill and its fruitfulness with a fraction, with ''motivation'' in the numerator (as well as ''invested time,'' although if there is true motivation, one can pinch off some ten minutes a day even with the busiest job), and ''inhibition'' in the denominator (the fear of starting to speak, of being clumsy, of being laughed at). In her conviction, the stronger the motivation is within us, and the more we can put aside inhibition, the sooner we can take possession of the language.\n\nAs she put it, she drove three ''[[automobile|auto]]''s in the world of languages, namely autolexia, autographia and autologia. (Out of the elements of these words, coming from Greek, ''auto-'' means ''self'', and ''&#8209;lexia'', ''&#8209;graphia'' and ''&#8209;logia'' refers to reading, writing and speaking respectively.) ''Autolexia'' means reading for myself: the book I discover by myself, which provides novelties again and again, which I can take with me anywhere, which won't get tired of being asked questions. ''Autographia'' means writing for myself, when I try to write about my thoughts, experiences, everyday things in the very language I'm just learning, no matter if it's silly, no matter if it's incorrect, no matter if a word or two is left out. ''Autologia'' means speaking with myself, when I try to express my thoughts or what I see on the street in the language I'm studying, when I keep on chatting to myself.\n\nEven she was bored with the fabricated dialogues of coursebooks, so her favourite method was to obtain an original novel in a language completely unknown to her, whose topic she personally found interesting (a detective story, a love story, or even a technical description would do), and that was how she deciphered, unravelled the basics of the language: the essence of the grammar and the most important words. She didn't let herself be set back by rare or complicated expressions: she skipped them, saying: what is important will sooner or later emerge again and will explain itself if necessary. (\"It's much more of a problem if the book becomes flavourless in our hands due to the many interruptions than not learning if the inspector watches the murderer from behind a blackthorn or a hawthorn.\")<!-- \u00cdgy tanulok nyelveket, 1995, p. 63. --> So we don't really need to look up each and every word in the dictionary: it only spoils our mood from the joy of reading and discovering the texts. In any case, what we can remember is what we have figured out ourselves. For this purpose, she always bought her own copies of books, since while reading she wrote on the edge of the pages what she had understood from the text by herself. This way one cannot avoid picking up something of a language\u2014as one can't rest until one has learnt who the murderer is, or whether the girl says yes in the end. (This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, [[Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi]] as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.)\n\nAnother keyword of hers was ''[[wiktionary:context|context]]'' (she was playfully called ''Kati Kontext'' herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don't understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered (which is perhaps the best possible way of learning), or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. ''high wind'', ''keen wind''), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kat\u00f3 Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, \"shoemaker's lasts\" or \"cookie-cutters\" elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an [[idiom]], elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures.\n\nShe didn't let herself be put off from her set objective by mistakes, failures or the ceaseless demand of perfection, but she always clung to the joyful, enjoyable side of language studies\u2014maybe that's where her success lay. She besieged the fortress of language again and again in a thousand and one ways. Her saying may be useful for those less confident of themselves: \"Language is the only thing worth knowing even poorly\" (in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: \"A nyelv az egyetlen, amit rosszul is \u00e9rdemes tudni\").\n\n==Quotes==\n:''Szilard Kato, the daughter of a prominent local physician, was born and raised in Pecs, where she went to the University to earn her degrees. She moved to Budapest after age 21, where she met and married Laub (later the family changed the name to Lomb) Frigyes, an engineer from a prominent family of electrical engineers. As a young adult, she became interested in other languages while in the family's bomb shelter as Russian troops were advancing on Budapest. She was quoted by her family as having said the following: \"Kids, we are going to have to learn Russian now...\". She managed to acquire a Russian typewriter and started learning the language. This single step started her on the road to a long and illustrious career in languages. As the Russian occupation unfolded, she served for a time as the translator for the Russian Commander of Budapest. In later years she became a professional interpreter. She acquired high levels of proficiency in 17 languages without extended stays in the countries where the languages were spoken. I interviewed Dr. Lomb (her PhD was in Chemistry) in depth ten years ago in Budapest. She attributed her success to massive amounts of comprehensible input, mostly through recreational reading. She was personally very interested in grammar and linguistics but felt they played a small role in language acquisition, loved dictionaries but looked up words when she read only if the word re-appeared several times and she still did not understand it, and hated to be corrected: \"Error correction makes you sick to your stomach.\"''\n:''References:''\n:''Krashen, S. and Kiss, N. 1996.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

The team's 23-0 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23-0 start beat the previous best start record of 16-0 set by the 1935\u201336 men's basketball team under [[Carlisle Cutchin]].

The game's plot is heavily affected by an invasion of an unnamed Asiatic nation, referred to as the \"Cromag War,\" launched by either New Mecca or whatever controlling government rules it.  New Mecca's faction is implied to have lost the ensuing conflict.\n\nThe player controls a [[katana]]-wielding [[Assassination|assassin]] called Subject Zero, as he completes various assassination contracts given to him by his psychiatrist, who also supplies him with \u2018Chronos\u2019, a drug that allows him to [[Slow motion|slow down time]] and [[Precognition|predict the future]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the game, Zero experiences recurring nightmares of a child in a primitive hut; a man wearing a labcoat bursts into the hut and warns the child to hide moments before being shot dead by the menacing silhouette of a soldier.  The child is heavily implied to be a young Zero.  Zero is also repeatedly visited by Comedy and Tragedy, two men wearing lab coats and [[sock and buskin|theater masks]], who taunt him about impending disaster in his future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game begins [[in media res]], as Zero is sent to extract a kidnapped scientist from a warehouse. The scientist is found but immediately killed by V, a [[Russia]]n mobster, who escapes. His mission failed, Zero visits his psychiatrist to receive his daily Chronos injection and a dossier on his next target, Josh Rose. Zero fights his way to Rose, who commits suicide. On his way home, Zero befriends a young girl living next door to his apartment in the Third District.\n\nNext, Zero is sent to kill DJ Electrohead, a disc jockey involved in the drug trade, and is explicitly warned not to speak to him.  Zero infiltrates his nightclub and can either kill Electrohead or listen to him confess to using Chronos before he is shot dead by an unseen sniper.  The media begins to refer to Zero's killing sprees as being the work of a [[serial killer]] known as The Dragon.\n\nZero's fourth target is Fa Yuan, a prison inmate. Upon arriving, Zero finds the prison staff massacred and his target already dead. SWAT officers arrive and storm the cellblock as Zero escapes. At his apartment, the Girl gives him a videotape she claims V left for him, containing a recording of V torturing and killing Zero's other neighbors.  Zero finds his psychiatrist's office closed the next morning and is picked up by V in a limousine on his way back. V offers to partner with Zero, who flatly refuses and is thrown out of the limo. He tracks V to an abandoned movie studio and fights through various film sets to reach him. Their fight is interrupted by Snow, a swordswoman working with V, who threatens Zero and leaves with V.\n\nBeginning to experience vivid hallucinations, Zero is assigned to kill Al-Qasim, a wealthy industrialist. Zero comes upon V and his men already storming Al-Qasim's mansion and is captured. When Zero uses precognition to mock him, V shoots Al-Qasim and leaves Zero to be killed by his henchman, Mr. Kissyface. Zero kills Kissyface and chases V and his men down the highway on motorcycles. Before Zero can kill him, V is dismembered and then abducted by another swordsman, who displays similar abilities to Zero's.  Before Zero flees, the swordsman claims that he is The Dragon.\n\nZero suffers further hallucinations of a now-dismembered V, who claims that his visions are the result of Chronos [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]\u2014without it, he will be trapped in time, unable to die. Zero's psychiatrist sends him to a [[Chinatown]] casino to hunt down The Dragon.  Within the Casino, Zero encounters The Dragon, as well as Headhunter, another Chronos user.  Zero duels Headhunter while The Dragon flees the scene; the duel ends in a draw, and Headhunter escapes.  While leaving, Zero acquires a tape containing the Prison's security footage from the night of Fa Yuan's murder. The tape footage shows The Dragon storming the prison and interrogating Fa Yuan, who tells him about Leon von Alvensleben, the creator of Chronos.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=askiisoft |author=Justin Stander |number=1123630637234176000 |date = 1 May 2019 |title=The laser girl's name is Headhunter, and she is not related to the psychiatrist.}}</ref>\n\nAfter finding the psychiatric office closed, Zero is directed to a slaughterhouse by an unknown caller.  The slaughterhouse proves to be a front for a training facility for 'NULLs', Chronos-enhanced super soldiers used by New Mecca in the Cromag war. While progressing through the facility, Zero is addressed by Alvensleben, who observes and speaks to him through a series of monitors throughout the facility.  After determining Zero was once an elite Gamma NULL, Alvensleben reveals the project was a failure, and its subjects marked for death.  Realizing that the footage of the scientist is a recording made years ago, Zero thaws the real Alvensleben from [[Cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]], killing him.\n\nZero locates and confronts the Psychiatrist, who confirms that Zero was a NULL soldier, and that his targets have all been related to Chronos. He then sends Zero to destroy the contents of Al-Qasim's [[safe room]] in an underground bunker. At the bottom, he finds Headhunter guarding the vault.  Headhunter confirms that she is also a NULL, explaining that she is entering Chronos withdrawal, and that Al-Qasim employed her as an assassin in exchange for a supply of the drug.  Zero kills her and enters the vault, where he finds a woman and children cowering in fear. Unable to bring himself to kill them, he abandons his contract.\n\nZero discovers his psychiatrist preparing to flee the city, brutally beats him to death, and injects himself with a massive dose of Chronos. Alternatively, if Zero interrupts the Psychiatrist constantly during conversations and deliberately disobeys his directives during missions, the Psychiatrist becomes enraged and injects himself with an unknown drug, transforming into a monstrosity.  Zero duels the monstrosity and kills him.  Upon Zero's victory, the scene immediately cuts to him calmly seated in the office, the Psychiatrist's human self dead by a stab to the head rather than by being beaten to death.  Zero searches the Psychiatrist's belongings and leaves without visibly injecting himself with Chronos.\n\nReturning to his apartment, he finds it burglarized, the young girl gone, and a cryptic note left behind. The landlady states that no children lived in the building. When questioned, Zero runs, and the police give chase.\n\nZero's recurring nightmare is replayed, minus the distortion. Zero is revealed to have been the NULL soldier responsible for shooting the Scientist, rather than the child who hid.  Having completed his objective, Zero exits the scene of the nightmare and walks over to stand next to The Dragon, who is shown to have been Zero's comrade in arms during the Cromag War.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Snow informs her superior of V's death at the hands of The Dragon, while The Dragon contemplates a board of evidence at a safe house. In a [[post-credits scene]], Comedy and Tragedy taunt the little girl as she cowers in fear.\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe game's programmer is Justin Stander,<ref name=\":0\" /> while the soundtrack is [[synthwave]] and is composed by LudoWic and Bill Kiley.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/02/06/everyones-drooling-over-this-gorgeous-trailer-for-super-stylish-indie-katana-zero/|title=Everyone\u2019s drooling over this gorgeous trailer for super-stylish indie Katana Zero|website=VG247.com|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> Development was announced \"100% complete\" by February 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/askiisoft/status/1100862905568894977|title=Katana ZERO development is 100% complete with some exciting news coming mid March, including console plans and an exact launch date reveal!

The game's plot is heavily affected by an invasion of an unnamed Asiatic nation, referred to as the \"Cromag War,\" launched by either New Mecca or whatever controlling government rules it.  New Mecca's faction is implied to have lost the ensuing conflict.\n\nThe player controls a [[katana]]-wielding [[Assassination|assassin]] called Subject Zero, as he completes various assassination contracts given to him by his psychiatrist, who also supplies him with \u2018Chronos\u2019, a drug that allows him to [[Slow motion|slow down time]] and [[Precognition|predict the future]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the game, Zero experiences recurring nightmares of a child in a primitive hut; a man wearing a labcoat bursts into the hut and warns the child to hide moments before being shot dead by the menacing silhouette of a soldier.  The child is heavily implied to be a young Zero.  Zero is also repeatedly visited by Comedy and Tragedy, two men wearing lab coats and [[sock and buskin|theater masks]], who taunt him about impending disaster in his future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game begins [[in media res]], as Zero is sent to extract a kidnapped scientist from a warehouse. The scientist is found but immediately killed by V, a [[Russia]]n mobster, who escapes. His mission failed, Zero visits his psychiatrist to receive his daily Chronos injection and a dossier on his next target, Josh Rose. Zero fights his way to Rose, who commits suicide. On his way home, Zero befriends a young girl living next door to his apartment in the Third District.\n\nNext, Zero is sent to kill DJ Electrohead, a disc jockey involved in the drug trade, and is explicitly warned not to speak to him.  Zero infiltrates his nightclub and can either kill Electrohead or listen to him confess to using Chronos before he is shot dead by an unseen sniper.  The media begins to refer to Zero's killing sprees as being the work of a [[serial killer]] known as The Dragon.\n\nZero's fourth target is Fa Yuan, a prison inmate. Upon arriving, Zero finds the prison staff massacred and his target already dead. SWAT officers arrive and storm the cellblock as Zero escapes. At his apartment, the Girl gives him a videotape she claims V left for him, containing a recording of V torturing and killing Zero's other neighbors.  Zero finds his psychiatrist's office closed the next morning and is picked up by V in a limousine on his way back. V offers to partner with Zero, who flatly refuses and is thrown out of the limo. He tracks V to an abandoned movie studio and fights through various film sets to reach him. Their fight is interrupted by Snow, a swordswoman working with V, who threatens Zero and leaves with V.\n\nBeginning to experience vivid hallucinations, Zero is assigned to kill Al-Qasim, a wealthy industrialist. Zero comes upon V and his men already storming Al-Qasim's mansion and is captured. When Zero uses precognition to mock him, V shoots Al-Qasim and leaves Zero to be killed by his henchman, Mr. Kissyface. Zero kills Kissyface and chases V and his men down the highway on motorcycles. Before Zero can kill him, V is dismembered and then abducted by another swordsman, who displays similar abilities to Zero's.  Before Zero flees, the swordsman claims that he is The Dragon.\n\nZero suffers further hallucinations of a now-dismembered V, who claims that his visions are the result of Chronos [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]\u2014without it, he will be trapped in time, unable to die. Zero's psychiatrist sends him to a [[Chinatown]] casino to hunt down The Dragon.  Within the Casino, Zero encounters The Dragon, as well as Headhunter, another Chronos user.  Zero duels Headhunter while The Dragon flees the scene; the duel ends in a draw, and Headhunter escapes.  While leaving, Zero acquires a tape containing the Prison's security footage from the night of Fa Yuan's murder. The tape footage shows The Dragon storming the prison and interrogating Fa Yuan, who tells him about Leon von Alvensleben, the creator of Chronos.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=askiisoft |author=Justin Stander |number=1123630637234176000 |date = 1 May 2019 |title=The laser girl's name is Headhunter, and she is not related to the psychiatrist.}}</ref>\n\nAfter finding the psychiatric office closed, Zero is directed to a slaughterhouse by an unknown caller.  The slaughterhouse proves to be a front for a training facility for 'NULLs', Chronos-enhanced super soldiers used by New Mecca in the Cromag war. While progressing through the facility, Zero is addressed by Alvensleben, who observes and speaks to him through a series of monitors throughout the facility.  After determining Zero was once an elite Gamma NULL, Alvensleben reveals the project was a failure, and its subjects marked for death.  Realizing that the footage of the scientist is a recording made years ago, Zero thaws the real Alvensleben from [[Cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]], killing him.\n\nZero locates and confronts the Psychiatrist, who confirms that Zero was a NULL soldier, and that his targets have all been related to Chronos. He then sends Zero to destroy the contents of Al-Qasim's [[safe room]] in an underground bunker. At the bottom, he finds Headhunter guarding the vault.  Headhunter confirms that she is also a NULL, explaining that she is entering Chronos withdrawal, and that Al-Qasim employed her as an assassin in exchange for a supply of the drug.  Zero kills her and enters the vault, where he finds a woman and children cowering in fear. Unable to bring himself to kill them, he abandons his contract.\n\nZero discovers his psychiatrist preparing to flee the city, brutally beats him to death, and injects himself with a massive dose of Chronos. Alternatively, if Zero interrupts the Psychiatrist constantly during conversations and deliberately disobeys his directives during missions, the Psychiatrist becomes enraged and injects himself with an unknown drug, transforming into a monstrosity.  Zero duels the monstrosity and kills him.  Upon Zero's victory, the scene immediately cuts to him calmly seated in the office, the Psychiatrist's human self dead by a stab to the head rather than by being beaten to death.  Zero searches the Psychiatrist's belongings and leaves without visibly injecting himself with Chronos.\n\nReturning to his apartment, he finds it burglarized, the young girl gone, and a cryptic note left behind. The landlady states that no children lived in the building. When questioned, Zero runs, and the police give chase.\n\nZero's recurring nightmare is replayed, minus the distortion. Zero is revealed to have been the NULL soldier responsible for shooting the Scientist, rather than the child who hid.  Having completed his objective, Zero exits the scene of the nightmare and walks over to stand next to The Dragon, who is shown to have been Zero's comrade in arms during the Cromag War.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Snow informs her superior of V's death at the hands of The Dragon, while The Dragon contemplates a board of evidence at a safe house. In a [[post-credits scene]], Comedy and Tragedy taunt the little girl as she cowers in fear.\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe game's programmer is Justin Stander,<ref name=\":0\" /> while the soundtrack is [[synthwave]] and is composed by LudoWic and Bill Kiley.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/02/06/everyones-drooling-over-this-gorgeous-trailer-for-super-stylish-indie-katana-zero/|title=Everyone\u2019s drooling over this gorgeous trailer for super-stylish indie Katana Zero|website=VG247.com|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> Development was announced \"100% complete\" by February 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/askiisoft/status/1100862905568894977|title=Katana ZERO development is 100% complete with some exciting news coming mid March, including console plans and an exact launch date reveal!

It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.<ref name=Kelly /> This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of [[The Crown|Crown]] and [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] ought to have functioned with respect to the royal [[dominion]]: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.<ref name=Kelly /> The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly [[royal prerogative]]s (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a [[President of the Continental Congress|president of the United States in Congress Assembled]] to preside over its deliberation as a neutral [[discussion moderator]].

They witnessed their [[hard currency]] pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] commerce preyed upon by [[North Africa]]n [[Barbary pirates|pirates]], and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.<ref name=Milkis /> Civil and political unrest loomed.\n\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between [[Virginia]] and Maryland at the [[Mount Vernon Conference]] in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|convention]] failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, [[Alexander Hamilton]] led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in [[Philadelphia]].

Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.<ref name=Milkis /> [[New York (state)|New York]] offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.<ref name=Milkis /> It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] emerged.\n\n== Powers and duties ==\n\n{{main|Powers of the president of the United States}}\n\n=== Article I legislative role ===\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|alt=|thumb|President [[Lyndon B.

The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', {{ussc|524|417|1998}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe president can also be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed.

The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally (e.g. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential responsibilities|Article II, Section 3]]) or statutorily mandated periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance is given as the oral [[State of the Union]] addresses, which often outline the president's legislative proposals for the coming year.

The first is [[executive privilege]], which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. [[George Washington]] first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]]'s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', {{ussc|418|683|1974}}, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|Lewinsky scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'', {{ussc|520|681|1997}}, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [[Precedent|legal precedent]] that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/executive_privilege.html|title=Executive Privilege 101|author=Millhiser, Ian|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[state secrets privilege]] allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] in legal proceedings if such release would harm [[national security]]. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to release military documents in the [[treason]] trial of [[Aaron Burr]] and again in ''[[Totten v.

Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege.

The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. [[Harry S. Truman]], president when this [[term limit]] came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term\u2014to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term\u2014before he withdrew from the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]].<ref name=22ndAPPC/>\n\nSince the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: [[Dwight D.

[[Richard Nixon]] was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of [[John F.

Until 1958, former presidents had no governmental aid to maintain themselves. Gradually, a small beginning became large, but with the public disaffection with Presidents Johnson and Nixon, some began to question the propriety and the amounts involved.

When the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|convention]] failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, [[Alexander Hamilton]] led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in [[Philadelphia]].

The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In ''[[Clinton v.

These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance is given as the oral [[State of the Union]] addresses, which often outline the president's legislative proposals for the coming year.

Since [[John Adams]] first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [[Harry S.

In addition, prior to ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties.

However, these nominations require [[Advice and consent#United States|Senate confirmation]] before they may take office.

The first is [[executive privilege]], which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. [[George Washington]] first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]]'s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', {{ussc|418|683|1974}}, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|Lewinsky scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'', {{ussc|520|681|1997}}, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [[Precedent|legal precedent]] that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/executive_privilege.html|title=Executive Privilege 101|author=Millhiser, Ian|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[state secrets privilege]] allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] in legal proceedings if such release would harm [[national security]]. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to release military documents in the [[treason]] trial of [[Aaron Burr]] and again in ''[[Totten v. United States]]'' {{ussc|92|105|1876}}, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1537579.html|title=Part III of the opinion in ''Mohamed v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

Jones]]'' (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president, and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 [[Mueller Report]] on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible [[obstruction of justice]], but investigators declined to refer [[Donald Trump]] for prosecution based on a [[United States Department of Justice]] policy against indicting an incumbent president.

At noon every day of the reunion, there is a parade of power, where all the operating steam and gas traction engines parade by the grandstand.\n\nThere are two main events every night of the reunion week. In the early evening, the [[Schaffner Players]] perform an old \"Toby and Susie\" [[Toby Tolliver]] play  in the Theatre Museum, after which there is a concert in the pavilion.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy was most likely not driven by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]]), pre-Neanderthals (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]]), and classic Neanderthals (MIS 4\u20133).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy was most likely not driven by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]]), pre-Neanderthals (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]]), and classic Neanderthals (MIS 4\u20133).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].\n\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]], living with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). While working for [[Atari]], Jobs develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after seeing that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there is another company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke , [[Bill Fernandez]] , ([[Victor Rasuk]]) and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.<ref name=slashdot/>\n\nTerrell's disappointment in the Apple I, inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the [[Apple II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success.\n\nApple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs denies is his child. [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Job's behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces out [[Jef Raskin]], the original Macintosh group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985.\n\nThe film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running [[NeXT]]. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Apple===\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Steve Jobs]]\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as [[Daniel Kottke]]\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as [[Bill Fernandez]]\n* Eddie Hassell as [[Chris Espinosa]]\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as [[Rod Holt]]\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as [[Bill Atkinson]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Andy Hertzfeld]]\n* [[Lenny Jacobson]] as [[Burrell Smith]]\n* [[Giles Matthey]] as [[Jony Ive]]\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as [[Mike Markkula]]\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[John Sculley]]\n* [[J.

In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Kutcher stated: {{cquote|Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film. It's personal for him, but it's also business.

I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair.\" He also said that the early versions of the screenplay \"were painful.

[[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\"<ref name=\"slashdot\">{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \"thought it was hilarious.\"<ref name=slashdot/> As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of [[fan fiction]] about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.\n<ref name=slashdot/>\n\n[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, \"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public.

The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].\n\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]], living with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). While working for [[Atari]], Jobs develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after seeing that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there is another company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke , [[Bill Fernandez]] , ([[Victor Rasuk]]) and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.<ref name=slashdot/>\n\nTerrell's disappointment in the Apple I, inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the [[Apple II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success.\n\nApple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs denies is his child. [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Job's behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces out [[Jef Raskin]], the original Macintosh group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985.\n\nThe film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running [[NeXT]]. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Apple===\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Steve Jobs]]\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as [[Daniel Kottke]]\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as [[Bill Fernandez]]\n* Eddie Hassell as [[Chris Espinosa]]\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as [[Rod Holt]]\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as [[Bill Atkinson]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Andy Hertzfeld]]\n* [[Lenny Jacobson]] as [[Burrell Smith]]\n* [[Giles Matthey]] as [[Jony Ive]]\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as [[Mike Markkula]]\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[John Sculley]]\n* [[J.

[[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\"<ref name=\"slashdot\">{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \"thought it was hilarious.\"<ref name=slashdot/> As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of [[fan fiction]] about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.\n<ref name=slashdot/>\n\n[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, \"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public.
