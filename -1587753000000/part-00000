The wife explained that one day she had been walking beside the Tweed when the river spirit appeared and ravished her. The Baron appears to have accepted the explanation; however, less convinced locals applied the nickname 'Tweedie' to the child, who became Baron Drumelzier.

This feature is variable in eastern hawks and generally absent in some light subspecies (i.e. ''B. j. fuertesi'').<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Most adult red-tails have a dark brown nape and upper head which gives them a somewhat hooded appearance, while the throat can variably present a lighter brown \u201cnecklace\u201d. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting and some adults may too manifest this stippling. The back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers, ranging from tawny to white, forming a variable imperfect \u201cV\u201d on the back. The tail of most adults, which of course gives this species its name, is rufous brick-red above with a variably sized black subterminal band and generally appears light buff-orange from below. In comparison, the typical pale immatures (i.e. less than two years old) typically have a mildly paler headed and tend to show a darker back than adults with more apparent pale wing feather edges above (for descriptions of dark morph juveniles from ''B. j. calurus'', which is also generally apt for description of rare dark morphs of other races, see under that subspecies description). In immature red-tailed hawks of all hues, the tail is a light brown above with numerous small dark brown bars of roughly equal width, but these tend to be much broader on dark morph birds.

They are the heaviest ''Buteos'' on average in eastern North America, albeit scarcely ahead of the larger winged [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus''), and second only in size in the west to the [[ferruginous hawk]] (''Buteo regalis''). Red-tailed hawks may be anywhere from the fifth to the ninth heaviest ''Buteo'' in the world depending on what figures are used. However, in the northwestern United States, ferruginous hawk females are 35% heavier than female red-tails from the same area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees /> On average, western red-tailed hawks are relatively longer winged and lankier proportioned but are slightly less stocky, compact and heavy than eastern red-tailed hawks in North America. Eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones. Based on comparisons of morphology and function amongst all accipitrids, these features imply that western red-tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on the wing as the habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey, whereas the birds of the east, which was historically well-wooded, are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Pearlstine>{{cite journal|author=Pearlstine, E.

The red-tailed hawk is the only North American hawk with a rufous tail and a blackish [[patagium]] marking on the leading edge of its wing (which is obscured only on dark morph adults and Harlan\u2019s hawks by similarly dark colored feathers).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Other larger adult ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America usually have obvious distinct markings that are absent in red-tails, whether the rufous-brown \u201cbeard\u201d of [[Swainson's hawk]]s (''Buteo swainsonii'') or the colorful rufous belly and shoulder markings and striking black-and-white mantle of [[red-shouldered hawk]]s (also the small \u201cwindows\u201d seen at the end of their primaries).<ref name= Robbins>Robbins, C. S., Bruun, B., & Zim, H. S. (2001). ''Birds of North America: a guide to field identification''. Macmillan.</ref> In perched individuals, even as silhouettes, the shape of large ''Buteos'' may be distinctive, such as the wingtips overhanging the tail in several other species, but not in red-tails. North American ''Buteos'' range from the dainty, compact builds of much smaller ''Buteos'', such as [[broad-winged hawk]] (''Buteo platypterus'') to the heavyset, neckless look of [[ferruginous hawk]]s or the [[rough-legged buzzard]] which has a compact, smaller appearance than a red-tail in perched birds due to its small bill, short neck and much shorter tarsus, while the opposite effect occurs in flying rough-legs with their much bigger wing area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Robbins/> In flight, most other large North American ''[[Buteo]]'' are distinctly longer and slenderer winged than red-tailed hawks, with the much paler [[ferruginous hawk]] having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive, chunky body. Swainson's hawks are distinctly darker on the wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler winged than typical red-tailed hawks. Pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny-pink (but never truly rufous) upper tail, and like red-tails tend to have dark markings on underwing-coverts and can have a dark belly band but compared to red-tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head, their [[Flight feathers|remiges]] are much whiter looking with very small dark primary tips, they lack the red-tail\u2019s diagnostic patagial marks and usually (but not always) also lack the dark subterminal tail-band, and ferruginous have a totally feathered tarsus. With its whitish head, the ferruginous hawk is most similar to Krider's red-tailed hawks, especially in immature plumage, but the larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape and the ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs. Several species share a belly band with the typical red-tailed hawk but they vary from subtle (as in the ferruginous hawk) to solid blackish, the latter in most light-morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> More difficult to identify among adult red-tails are its darkest variations, as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America also have dark morphs. Western dark morph red-tails (i.e. ''calurus'') adults, however, retain the typical distinctive brick-red tail which other species lack, which may stand out even more against the otherwise all chocolate brown-black bird. Standard pale juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in the outer half of the upper surface of the wing which other juvenile ''Buteo'' lack.<ref name= CRPreston/> The most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles, Harlan\u2019s hawk and some Krider\u2019s hawks (the latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as aforementioned). Some darker juveniles are similar enough to other ''Buteo'' juveniles that it has been stated that they \"cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions.\"<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/> However, field identification techniques have advanced in the last few decades and most experienced hawk-watchers can distinguish even the most vexingly plumaged immature hawks, especially as the wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many. Harlan\u2019s hawks are most similar to dark morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s and dark morph [[ferruginous hawk]]s. Wing shape is the most reliable identification tool for distinguishing the Harlan\u2019s from these, but also the pale streaking on the breast of Harlan\u2019s, which tends to be conspicuous in most individuals, and is lacking in the other hawks. Also dark morph ferruginous hawks do not have the dark subterminal band of a Harlan\u2019s hawk but do bear a black undertail covert lacking in Harlan\u2019s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name=\"Harlan\">{{cite journal|author=Liguori, J. & Sullivan, B.L.|year=2010|title=Comparison of Harlan's hawk with Eastern & Western Red-tailed Hawks|journal=Birding|pages=30\u201337}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Red-tailed hawk in flight.jpg|thumb|right|In flight showing the red tail]]\n[[File:Hawk hovers.ogv|thumb|Red-tailed hawk hovers in the wind]]\nThe red-tailed hawk is a member of the subfamily [[Buteoninae]] which includes about 55 currently recognized species.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= delHoyo/> Unlike many lineages of accipitrid, which seemed to have radiated out of Africa or south Asia, the Buteoninae clearly originated in the Americas based on fossil records and current species distributions (more than 75% of the extant hawks from this lineage are found in the Americas).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Brodkorb, P.

Immatures are often missed in winter bird counts, unless they are being displaced by dominant adults. Generally though, immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them.

Despite being not native to North America, pheasants usually live in a wild state. All Wisconsin studies also found large numbers of chickens (''Gallus gallus domesticus''), making up as much as 14.4% of the diet. Many studies reflect that free-ranging chickens are vulnerable to red-tailed hawks although somewhat lesser numbers are taken by them overall in comparison to nocturnal predators (i.e. [[Great horned owl|owl]]s and [[Red fox|foxes]]) and [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]]s.<ref name= Orians/><ref name= Marti95/><ref name= Gates/> In [[Rochester, Alberta]], fairly large numbers of [[ruffed grouse]] (''Bonasa umbellus'') were taken but relatively more juveniles were taken of this species than the two other main contributors to biomass here, snowshoe hare and Townsend\u2019s ground squirrel, as they are fairly independent early on and more readily available.

None of these three families are known as particularly skilled or swift fliers but the species are generally small enough that they would generally easily be more nimble in flight than a red-tailed hawk. One of these are the [[woodpecker]]s, if only for one species, the {{convert|131.6|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[northern flicker]] (''Colaptes auratus''), which was the best represented bird species in the diet in 27 North American studies and was even the fourth most often detected prey species of all.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Sherrod/><ref name= Blumstein/> Woodpeckers are often a favorite in the diet of large raptors as their relatively slow, undulating flight makes these relatively easy targets.

Furthermore, due to its ability to nest in varied habitats, home ranges also frequently abut those of other raptor species.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Preston/> The most obvious similar species in their range are other ''[[Buteo]]'' hawks, especially larger species with a similar ecological niche.

It also breeds notably later than the other two species.<ref>England, A. S., Bechard, M. J., & Houston, C. S. (1997). ''Swainson's hawk''.

Part of this advantage is that the Swainson's hawk is apparently a superior flier both in long and short distance flights, with its more pointed wing shape and lower wing loading allowing it more agile, sustained and speedier flight that the bulkier hawks cannot match.<ref name= Swainson>Janes, S.

Red-tails may be somewhat dominant based on prior reports in food conflicts but the ferruginous hawk may also win these.<ref name= CRPreston/> Where they overlap, the hawk species may adjust their daily routine to minimize contact, which tends to be costly of time and energy and may cause the hawks to abandon their nests for long stretches of time, which in turn leaves their young vulnerable to predation.<ref name= Palmer/> When habitats change rapidly, often due to human interference, and the species nest more closely than natural partitioning would allow, in all three nesting success can decline significantly.<ref name= Schmutz/>\n\nBeyond the Swainson's and ferruginous hawks, six other ''Buteos'' co-occur with red-tailed hawks in different parts of North America. Many of these are substantially smaller than red-tails and most serious territorial conflicts with them are naturally mitigated by nesting in deeper wooded areas.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Johnsgard/> One other larger species, the [[rough-legged buzzard]], mostly nests far north of the breeding range of red-tailed hawks. However, in [[Alaska]] they sometimes nest in the same areas. The rough-legged buzzards are both cliff and tree nesters and areas used by the two species are not necessarily mutually exclusive but each seems to avoid the other, in part by differing breeding schedules.<ref>Mindell, D.P. (1983). ''Nesting raptors in southwestern Alaska: Status, distribution, and aspects of biology''. Alaska Technical Report 8. Anchorage: Bureau of Land Management.</ref> Wintering rough-legged buzzards may regularly come into conflict over food with red-tailed hawks and seem to be subordinate to the red-tails, with several records of them being chased off both kills and carrion by the red-tailed hawks. During winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate, the rough-legged being a much more aerial hunter, but rough-legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red-tailed hawk flew towards them. There is at least one case, however, of a rough-legged buzzard being the victor of a conflict over a kill with a red-tailed hawk.<ref name= Lowe/><ref name= Bildstein/> Red-tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer, medium-sized ''Buteos'' such as [[red-shouldered hawk]]s and [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus'').<ref name= Brown/> In [[Massachusetts]], red-shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red-tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on [[Cape Cod]]. Nesting range overlap here most often occurred on [[white pine]] forests. As habitat has opened over time, red-tailed hawks frequently took over former red-shouldered hawk territories, even using their nests in two cases.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Bent/> In north-central Florida, it was found during winter that red-shouldered and red-tailed hawk habitat usage blurred and, because the local habitat favors red-shouldered hawks, they easily outnumbered the number of red-tailed hawks in the area.

Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red-tail nests. The habitat preferences of the two species are quite similar and the owl frequently uses old red-tail nests, but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over the generally open situation around red-tailed hawk nests. Sometimes in warmer areas, the owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by the time red-tails start to lay. However, when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles, the owl sometimes takes over an occupied red-tail nest, causing desertion. Red-tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned, while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce, especially when they rely on leporids such as [[Snowshoe hare|hares]] and [[Black-tailed jackrabbit|jackrabbits]].<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Marti95/><ref name= Doyle/><ref name= Smith/> For example, in [[Alberta]], when [[snowshoe hare]]s were at their population peak, red-tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many, with only a slight increase in mean clutch size, whereas the owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers. The red-tails migratory behavior was considered as the likely cause of this lack of effect, whereas great horned owls remained through the winter and was subject to winter-stress and greater risk of starvation.<ref name= McInvaille>McInvaille, W. B. (1972). ''Predator-prey relations and breeding biology of the great horned owl and red-tailed hawk in central Alberta''.

On the other hand, red-tailed hawks are rarely (if ever) a threat to the great horned owl. Occasionally a red-tailed hawk can strike down an owl during the day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, P.W. & Grigsby, E.M. |year=1980|title=Red-tailed Hawks Attack Great Horned Owl|journal=Inland Bird Banding|volume= 54|pages=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, D.

The breeding season usually begins in late February through March, but can commence as early as late December in [[Arizona]] and late January in [[Wisconsin]] or to the opposite extreme as late as mid-April as in [[Alberta]].<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Orians/><ref name= Luttich/><ref name= Mader/> In this pre-nesting period, high-circling with much calling will occur. One or both members of a pair may be involved. The courtship display often involves dangling legs, at times the pair will touching each other's wings and male's feet may touch female's back, she may occasional roll over and present talons, food passes are rarely reported.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Preston/><ref name= Lowe/> High soaring occurs aseasonally. Circling above territory tends to be done noisily and conspicuously, helping insure against possible takeovers. Spring circling of a pair can be a prelude to copulation.<ref name= Brown/> A typical sky-dance involves the male hawk climbing high in flight with deep, exaggerated beats and then diving precipitously on half-closed wings at great speed, checking, and shooting back up, or often plunging less steeply and repeating process in a full rollercoaster across the sky. Sky-dances are done on periphery of the pair\u2019s territory and it appears to designate the territory limits, occasionally one male\u2019s sky-dance may also trigger a sky-dance by a neighboring male, who may even run a parallel course in the sky. Sky-dances no longer occur after late incubation.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Bent/> Boundary flight displays may be engaged in by all four birds of 2 adjacent pairs.<ref name= Brown/> Cartwheeling with interlocking talons is also seen occasionally in spring, almost always a territorial male expelling an intruding one, the latter often being a second or third year male that is newly mature. A perched display, with fluffed-out breast feathers may too occur at this time. Even males that are in spring migration have been recorded engaging in a separate display: circling at slow speed before partially closing wings, dropping legs with talons spread and tilting from side-to-side. A female hawk is usually around when migrating male does this but she does not engage in this display herself.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Palmer/> The area of occupancy of breeding territories by pairs is variable based on regional habitat composition. The highest recorded density of pairs was in California where each pair occurred on {{convert|1.3|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which was actually just ahead of [[Puerto Rico]] where pair occupancy averaged {{convert|1.56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in peak habitat.

Here and elsewhere, both members of the pair stay quite close together throughout winter if they are sedentary. On the other hand, migrant populations tend to separate while migrating and return to the same territory to find its prior mate, sometimes before they reach their home range.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Santana/><ref name= Petersen/> In [[Alaska]], returning migrant pairs were able to displace lone red-tailed hawks that had stayed on residence, especially lone males but sometimes even lone females.<ref name= Lowe/> In general, the red-tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies.<ref name=\"Terres\">{{cite book | last =Terres | first =John K. | authorlink =John Kenneth Terres | title =The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds | publisher =Knopf | year =1980 | location =New York | page =[https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/1109 1109] | isbn =978-0-394-46651-4 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/1109 }}</ref> Although pairs often mate for life, replacement of mates can often be quite fast for this common bird species.

The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. The young red-tails are active by the second day when they issue soft peeping calls, bounce, and wave continuously with their wings. By day 7, the bouncing and peeping begin to wane, and young start to peck at prey in their nest. Nestlings emit high whistling notes (usually in response to adults overhead) by day 10, sit up on tarsometatarsi by day 15, become aggressive toward intruders by day 16, strike out with talons and wings by day 21, begin to stretch wings and exercise regularly by day 30. After 42 to 46 days, the eyasses begin to leave the nest and tear apart prey for themselves.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Fitch/> The amount of food brought to the nest daily varies considerably, based on brood size and prey availability.

In the east, red-tailed hawk females rarely defend nests from humans but historically in California and quite often still in [[Alaska]], some female will dive repeatedly and \"savagely\", sometimes snapping off large branches in her temper, occasionally stunning herself or inadvertently knocking down her own youngster if it is attempting to fledge. Apparently, the less extensive prior exposure they have to humans may make mature females more aggressive towards humans near the nest.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Lowe/> Although development is asynchronical in most nests, [[runt]]ing may sometimes be recorded and even [[siblicide]] may occur, with the parents feeding the weaker, younger chicks less so and both the siblings and parents occasionally aggressively pecking the \u201crunts\u201d of the nest. Ultimately, the runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in the nest, discarded out of the nest after starvation or consumed by the parents or the siblings. However, as a whole, such killings are fairly rare and only occur when food supplies are extremely low, often this being in sync with poor spring weather (such as overly rainy or cold conditions).<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Hagar/><ref name= Stinson/> If there is too much food, such as [[California ground squirrel]]s in California, the parents will discard remains after a day or two since decomposition of their prey invites infection, other diseases and blood-sucking insects to the nest that may endanger the nestlings. However, after about four weeks, the female often stops discarding leftover prey and the increased presence of flies may form somewhat of a risk to disease in the young but may also merely get the young to leave the nest sooner.<ref name= Brown/><ref name= Fitch/> One nest in California had two females and one male attended to; the male performed his usual function but both females would brood and tend to the nest.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wiley, J.

During this period, the fledglings remain fairly sedentary, though they may chase parents and beg for food. Parents deliver food directly or, more commonly, drop it near the young. Short flights are typically undertaken for the first 3 weeks after fledgling and the young red-tails activity level often doubles. About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey, which often consists of insects and frogs that the young hawks can drop down to onto the ground with relative ease. At the point they are 15 weeks old, they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight, and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. In some extreme cases, juvenile red-tails may prolong their association with their parents to as long as they are half a year old, as was recorded in [[Wisconsin]].<ref name= Petersen/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Johnson>{{cite journal|author=Johnson, S.

Some have even learned to use a falcon-like diving stoop to capture challenging game birds such as pheasants in open country.\n\nIn the course of a typical hunt, a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to [[Hunting#Methods|flush]] prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game.

Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting and some adults may too manifest this stippling. The back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers, ranging from tawny to white, forming a variable imperfect \u201cV\u201d on the back. The tail of most adults, which of course gives this species its name, is rufous brick-red above with a variably sized black subterminal band and generally appears light buff-orange from below. In comparison, the typical pale immatures (i.e. less than two years old) typically have a mildly paler headed and tend to show a darker back than adults with more apparent pale wing feather edges above (for descriptions of dark morph juveniles from ''B. j. calurus'', which is also generally apt for description of rare dark morphs of other races, see under that subspecies description). In immature red-tailed hawks of all hues, the tail is a light brown above with numerous small dark brown bars of roughly equal width, but these tend to be much broader on dark morph birds.

Eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones. Based on comparisons of morphology and function amongst all accipitrids, these features imply that western red-tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on the wing as the habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey, whereas the birds of the east, which was historically well-wooded, are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Pearlstine>{{cite journal|author=Pearlstine, E.

The red-tailed hawk is the only North American hawk with a rufous tail and a blackish [[patagium]] marking on the leading edge of its wing (which is obscured only on dark morph adults and Harlan\u2019s hawks by similarly dark colored feathers).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Other larger adult ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America usually have obvious distinct markings that are absent in red-tails, whether the rufous-brown \u201cbeard\u201d of [[Swainson's hawk]]s (''Buteo swainsonii'') or the colorful rufous belly and shoulder markings and striking black-and-white mantle of [[red-shouldered hawk]]s (also the small \u201cwindows\u201d seen at the end of their primaries).<ref name= Robbins>Robbins, C. S., Bruun, B., & Zim, H. S. (2001). ''Birds of North America: a guide to field identification''. Macmillan.</ref> In perched individuals, even as silhouettes, the shape of large ''Buteos'' may be distinctive, such as the wingtips overhanging the tail in several other species, but not in red-tails. North American ''Buteos'' range from the dainty, compact builds of much smaller ''Buteos'', such as [[broad-winged hawk]] (''Buteo platypterus'') to the heavyset, neckless look of [[ferruginous hawk]]s or the [[rough-legged buzzard]] which has a compact, smaller appearance than a red-tail in perched birds due to its small bill, short neck and much shorter tarsus, while the opposite effect occurs in flying rough-legs with their much bigger wing area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Robbins/> In flight, most other large North American ''[[Buteo]]'' are distinctly longer and slenderer winged than red-tailed hawks, with the much paler [[ferruginous hawk]] having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive, chunky body. Swainson's hawks are distinctly darker on the wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler winged than typical red-tailed hawks. Pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny-pink (but never truly rufous) upper tail, and like red-tails tend to have dark markings on underwing-coverts and can have a dark belly band but compared to red-tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head, their [[Flight feathers|remiges]] are much whiter looking with very small dark primary tips, they lack the red-tail\u2019s diagnostic patagial marks and usually (but not always) also lack the dark subterminal tail-band, and ferruginous have a totally feathered tarsus. With its whitish head, the ferruginous hawk is most similar to Krider's red-tailed hawks, especially in immature plumage, but the larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape and the ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs. Several species share a belly band with the typical red-tailed hawk but they vary from subtle (as in the ferruginous hawk) to solid blackish, the latter in most light-morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> More difficult to identify among adult red-tails are its darkest variations, as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America also have dark morphs. Western dark morph red-tails (i.e. ''calurus'') adults, however, retain the typical distinctive brick-red tail which other species lack, which may stand out even more against the otherwise all chocolate brown-black bird. Standard pale juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in the outer half of the upper surface of the wing which other juvenile ''Buteo'' lack.<ref name= CRPreston/> The most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles, Harlan\u2019s hawk and some Krider\u2019s hawks (the latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as aforementioned). Some darker juveniles are similar enough to other ''Buteo'' juveniles that it has been stated that they \"cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions.\"<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/> However, field identification techniques have advanced in the last few decades and most experienced hawk-watchers can distinguish even the most vexingly plumaged immature hawks, especially as the wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many. Harlan\u2019s hawks are most similar to dark morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s and dark morph [[ferruginous hawk]]s. Wing shape is the most reliable identification tool for distinguishing the Harlan\u2019s from these, but also the pale streaking on the breast of Harlan\u2019s, which tends to be conspicuous in most individuals, and is lacking in the other hawks.

Most birds in resident populations, which are well more than half of all red-tailed hawks, usually split non-breeding season activity between territorial soaring flight and sitting on a perch. Often perching is for hunting purposes, but many will sit on a tree branch for hours, occasionally stretching on a single wing or leg to keep limber, with no signs of hunting intent.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Bent/> Wintering typical pale-morph hawks in [[Arkansas]] were found to perch in open areas near the top of tall, isolated trees, whereas dark morphs more frequently perched in dense groups of trees.<ref name= CRPreston/> For many, and perhaps most, red-tailed hawks being mobbed by various birds is a daily concern and can effectively disrupt many of their daily behaviors. Mostly larger [[passerine]]s, of multiple families from [[tyrant flycatcher]]s to [[icterid]]s, will mob red-tails, despite that other raptors such as ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks and [[falcon]]s are a notably greater danger to them.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Knight, R.

Immatures are often missed in winter bird counts, unless they are being displaced by dominant adults. Generally though, immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them.

Springer US.</ref> Red-tailed hawks usually hunt by watching for prey activity from a high perch, also known as still hunting. Upon being spotted, prey is dropped down upon by the hawk. Red-tails often select the highest available perches within a given environment since the greater the height they are at, the less flapping is required and the faster the downward glide they can attain toward nearby prey. If prey is closer than average, the hawk may glide at a steep downward angle with few flaps, if farther than average, it may flap a few swift wingbeats alternating with glides. Perch hunting is the most successful hunting method generally speaking for red-tailed hawks and can account for up to 83% of their daily activities (i.e. in winter).<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Palmer/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Orde, C.

Due to the extreme dietary plasticity of red-tails, the food habits of other birds of prey regularly overlap considerably with red-tails. Furthermore, due to its ability to nest in varied habitats, home ranges also frequently abut those of other raptor species.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Preston/> The most obvious similar species in their range are other ''[[Buteo]]'' hawks, especially larger species with a similar ecological niche. Two of the larger, more widespread other ''Buteos'' are the [[Swainson's hawk]] and the [[ferruginous hawk]]s and, as with many other birds of prey, red-tailed hawks occur in almost the entirety of these birds\u2019 breeding ranges.<ref name=Preston/><ref name=\"Johnsgard\">Johnsgard, P.

It also breeds notably later than the other two species.<ref>England, A. S., Bechard, M. J., & Houston, C. S. (1997). ''Swainson's hawk''. American Ornithologists' Union.</ref> Surprisingly, although it's slightly smaller in body mass and has notably smaller (and presumably weaker) feet than ferruginous and red-tailed hawks, the Swainson's is actually usually (but not invariably) dominant in territorial conflicts over the other two. Part of this advantage is that the Swainson's hawk is apparently a superior flier both in long and short distance flights, with its more pointed wing shape and lower wing loading allowing it more agile, sustained and speedier flight that the bulkier hawks cannot match.<ref name= Swainson>Janes, S.

Usually, the habitat preferences of red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks are discrepant enough to keep serious territorial conflicts to a minimum.<ref name= Steenhof2/><ref name= Janes/> However, red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks occasionally engaged in [[kleptoparasitism]] towards one another, usually during winter. Red-tails may be somewhat dominant based on prior reports in food conflicts but the ferruginous hawk may also win these.<ref name= CRPreston/> Where they overlap, the hawk species may adjust their daily routine to minimize contact, which tends to be costly of time and energy and may cause the hawks to abandon their nests for long stretches of time, which in turn leaves their young vulnerable to predation.<ref name= Palmer/> When habitats change rapidly, often due to human interference, and the species nest more closely than natural partitioning would allow, in all three nesting success can decline significantly.<ref name= Schmutz/>\n\nBeyond the Swainson's and ferruginous hawks, six other ''Buteos'' co-occur with red-tailed hawks in different parts of North America. Many of these are substantially smaller than red-tails and most serious territorial conflicts with them are naturally mitigated by nesting in deeper wooded areas.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Johnsgard/> One other larger species, the [[rough-legged buzzard]], mostly nests far north of the breeding range of red-tailed hawks. However, in [[Alaska]] they sometimes nest in the same areas. The rough-legged buzzards are both cliff and tree nesters and areas used by the two species are not necessarily mutually exclusive but each seems to avoid the other, in part by differing breeding schedules.<ref>Mindell, D.P. (1983). ''Nesting raptors in southwestern Alaska: Status, distribution, and aspects of biology''. Alaska Technical Report 8. Anchorage: Bureau of Land Management.</ref> Wintering rough-legged buzzards may regularly come into conflict over food with red-tailed hawks and seem to be subordinate to the red-tails, with several records of them being chased off both kills and carrion by the red-tailed hawks. During winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate, the rough-legged being a much more aerial hunter, but rough-legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red-tailed hawk flew towards them. There is at least one case, however, of a rough-legged buzzard being the victor of a conflict over a kill with a red-tailed hawk.<ref name= Lowe/><ref name= Bildstein/> Red-tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer, medium-sized ''Buteos'' such as [[red-shouldered hawk]]s and [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus'').<ref name= Brown/> In [[Massachusetts]], red-shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red-tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on [[Cape Cod]]. Nesting range overlap here most often occurred on [[white pine]] forests. As habitat has opened over time, red-tailed hawks frequently took over former red-shouldered hawk territories, even using their nests in two cases.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Bent/> In north-central Florida, it was found during winter that red-shouldered and red-tailed hawk habitat usage blurred and, because the local habitat favors red-shouldered hawks, they easily outnumbered the number of red-tailed hawks in the area. Therefore, again with sufficient habitat partitioning, the two species can live near one another without negatively effecting one another.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bohall, P. G., & Collopy, M.

Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red-tail nests. The habitat preferences of the two species are quite similar and the owl frequently uses old red-tail nests, but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over the generally open situation around red-tailed hawk nests. Sometimes in warmer areas, the owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by the time red-tails start to lay. However, when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles, the owl sometimes takes over an occupied red-tail nest, causing desertion. Red-tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned, while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce, especially when they rely on leporids such as [[Snowshoe hare|hares]] and [[Black-tailed jackrabbit|jackrabbits]].<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Marti95/><ref name= Doyle/><ref name= Smith/> For example, in [[Alberta]], when [[snowshoe hare]]s were at their population peak, red-tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many, with only a slight increase in mean clutch size, whereas the owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers. The red-tails migratory behavior was considered as the likely cause of this lack of effect, whereas great horned owls remained through the winter and was subject to winter-stress and greater risk of starvation.<ref name= McInvaille>McInvaille, W. B. (1972). ''Predator-prey relations and breeding biology of the great horned owl and red-tailed hawk in central Alberta''.

On the other hand, red-tailed hawks are rarely (if ever) a threat to the great horned owl. Occasionally a red-tailed hawk can strike down an owl during the day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, P.W. & Grigsby, E.M. |year=1980|title=Red-tailed Hawks Attack Great Horned Owl|journal=Inland Bird Banding|volume= 54|pages=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, D.

The behavioral variation is probably related to the activity of hawks, which may feel the need to protect their nests and food resources while actively breeding but are not usually willing to risk their lives in attacking an eagle while migrating or wintering.

Circling above territory tends to be done noisily and conspicuously, helping insure against possible takeovers. Spring circling of a pair can be a prelude to copulation.<ref name= Brown/> A typical sky-dance involves the male hawk climbing high in flight with deep, exaggerated beats and then diving precipitously on half-closed wings at great speed, checking, and shooting back up, or often plunging less steeply and repeating process in a full rollercoaster across the sky. Sky-dances are done on periphery of the pair\u2019s territory and it appears to designate the territory limits, occasionally one male\u2019s sky-dance may also trigger a sky-dance by a neighboring male, who may even run a parallel course in the sky. Sky-dances no longer occur after late incubation.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Bent/> Boundary flight displays may be engaged in by all four birds of 2 adjacent pairs.<ref name= Brown/> Cartwheeling with interlocking talons is also seen occasionally in spring, almost always a territorial male expelling an intruding one, the latter often being a second or third year male that is newly mature. A perched display, with fluffed-out breast feathers may too occur at this time. Even males that are in spring migration have been recorded engaging in a separate display: circling at slow speed before partially closing wings, dropping legs with talons spread and tilting from side-to-side. A female hawk is usually around when migrating male does this but she does not engage in this display herself.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Palmer/> The area of occupancy of breeding territories by pairs is variable based on regional habitat composition.

The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. The young red-tails are active by the second day when they issue soft peeping calls, bounce, and wave continuously with their wings. By day 7, the bouncing and peeping begin to wane, and young start to peck at prey in their nest. Nestlings emit high whistling notes (usually in response to adults overhead) by day 10, sit up on tarsometatarsi by day 15, become aggressive toward intruders by day 16, strike out with talons and wings by day 21, begin to stretch wings and exercise regularly by day 30. After 42 to 46 days, the eyasses begin to leave the nest and tear apart prey for themselves.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Fitch/> The amount of food brought to the nest daily varies considerably, based on brood size and prey availability.

Some females may lose over {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}} between hatching and fledging.<ref name= Preston/> During brooding the female may become aggressive to intruders, including humans. In the east, red-tailed hawk females rarely defend nests from humans but historically in California and quite often still in [[Alaska]], some female will dive repeatedly and \"savagely\", sometimes snapping off large branches in her temper, occasionally stunning herself or inadvertently knocking down her own youngster if it is attempting to fledge. Apparently, the less extensive prior exposure they have to humans may make mature females more aggressive towards humans near the nest.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Lowe/> Although development is asynchronical in most nests, [[runt]]ing may sometimes be recorded and even [[siblicide]] may occur, with the parents feeding the weaker, younger chicks less so and both the siblings and parents occasionally aggressively pecking the \u201crunts\u201d of the nest. Ultimately, the runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in the nest, discarded out of the nest after starvation or consumed by the parents or the siblings. However, as a whole, such killings are fairly rare and only occur when food supplies are extremely low, often this being in sync with poor spring weather (such as overly rainy or cold conditions).<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Hagar/><ref name= Stinson/> If there is too much food, such as [[California ground squirrel]]s in California, the parents will discard remains after a day or two since decomposition of their prey invites infection, other diseases and blood-sucking insects to the nest that may endanger the nestlings. However, after about four weeks, the female often stops discarding leftover prey and the increased presence of flies may form somewhat of a risk to disease in the young but may also merely get the young to leave the nest sooner.<ref name= Brown/><ref name= Fitch/> One nest in California had two females and one male attended to; the male performed his usual function but both females would brood and tend to the nest.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wiley, J.

As recorded in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia, on June 9, 2017, a juvenile red-tailed hawk was taken by a pair of bald eagles back to their nest, whereupon the chick, originally taken as prey, was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledglings. After surviving six weeks amongst the eagles, the fledgling, nicknamed \"Spunky\" by birdwatchers, had successfully begun learning to hunt and fly, showing that the aggressive hawk was able to survive amongst a nest of much larger adoptive siblings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40224776|title=Bald eagle adopts 'mortal enemy' baby hawk|date=9 June 2017|access-date=4 April 2018|work=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/red-tailed-hawk-adopted-by-bald-eagles-video-spd/|title=Why This Young Hawk Thinks It's an Eagle|date=25 July 2017|work=National Geographic|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fledging and immaturity===\n[[File:Red-tail hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) chick (14045509068).jpg|thumb|left|A red-tailed hawk chick peers out of its cliff nest]]\nYoung typically leave the nest for the first time and attempt their first flights at about 42\u201346 days after hatching but usually they stay very near the nest for the first few days. During this period, the fledglings remain fairly sedentary, though they may chase parents and beg for food. Parents deliver food directly or, more commonly, drop it near the young. Short flights are typically undertaken for the first 3 weeks after fledgling and the young red-tails activity level often doubles. About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey, which often consists of insects and frogs that the young hawks can drop down to onto the ground with relative ease. At the point they are 15 weeks old, they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight, and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. In some extreme cases, juvenile red-tails may prolong their association with their parents to as long as they are half a year old, as was recorded in [[Wisconsin]].<ref name= Petersen/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Johnson>{{cite journal|author=Johnson, S.

A well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game.

The film stars [[Jodie Foster]], [[Scott Baio]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Randy Quaid]], and [[Cherie Currie]], in her acting debut. It revolves around a group of teenage girls [[coming of age]] in suburban [[Los Angeles]] toward the end of the disco era.\n\n''Foxes'' was theatrically released on February 29, 1980, by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram Pictures]].\nThe film was Foster's penultimate major film appearance before taking a sabbatical from acting to attend [[Yale]]. It received several positive reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success grossing $7,470,348 in North America. The film has attained a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|status]] and is often cited amongst the greatest teenage-centric films.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of four teenage girls in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during the end of the 1970s have painful emotional troubles. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is a [[disco]] queen who is fascinated by her sexuality, likes boys and has many relationship troubles. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) is unhappily overweight and angry that she is still a virgin. Her parents are overprotective, and she has an annoying younger sister. Annie ([[Cherie Currie]]) is a teenage runaway who drinks, uses drugs, and runs away from her abusive [[police officer]] father. Jeanie ([[Jodie Foster]]) feels she has to take care of them all, is fighting with her divorced mother, and is yearning for a closer relationship with her distant father, a [[tour manager]] for the rock band [[Angel (band)|Angel]].\n\nThe girls believe school is a waste of time, their boyfriends are immature, and that they are alienated from the adults in their lives. All four seem immersed in the decadence of the late 1970s. The only way for them to loosen up and forget the bad things happening in their lives is to party and have fun. Annie is the least responsible, while Jeanie is ready to grow up and wants to stop acting like a child. Jeanie is most worried about Annie and continually takes risks to try to keep Annie clean and safe. Annie's unstable behavior keeps everyone on edge, and finally leads to her death in an automobile accident.\n\nAnnie's death brings changes for the rest of the girls. Madge marries Jay ([[Randy Quaid]]), an older man who deflowered her, Deirdre no longer acts boy-crazy, and Jeanie graduates from high school and is about to head off to college. After Madge and Jay's wedding, Jeanie visits Annie's grave and smokes a cigarette. With a smile, she muses that Annie wanted to be buried under a pear tree, \"not in a box or anything\", so that each year her friends could come by, have a pear and say, \"Annie's tastin' good this year, huh?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Jeanie\n* [[Scott Baio]] as Brad\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Jay\n* [[Sally Kellerman]] as Mary\n* [[Cherie Currie]] as Annie Mallick\n* Marilyn Kagan as Madge Axman\n* Kandice Stroh as Deirdre Tompkins\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Axman\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Debbie\n* [[Robert Romanus]] as Scott\n* [[Adam Faith]] as Bryan\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received an approval rating of 67% from 9 reviews of [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/foxes|title= Foxes (1980)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nNoted film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a good review, writing:<blockquote>\nThe movie follows its four foxes through several days and several adventures. It's a loosely structured film, deliberately episodic to suggest the shapeless form of these teen-agers' typical days and nights. Things happen on impulse. Stuff comes up. Kids stay out all night, or run away, or get drunk, or get involved in what's supposed to be a civilized dinner party until it's crashed by a mob of greasers.\n\nThe subject of the movie is the way these events are seen so very differently by the kids and their parents.

The film stars [[Jodie Foster]], [[Scott Baio]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Randy Quaid]], and [[Cherie Currie]], in her acting debut. It revolves around a group of teenage girls [[coming of age]] in suburban [[Los Angeles]] toward the end of the disco era.\n\n''Foxes'' was theatrically released on February 29, 1980, by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram Pictures]].\nThe film was Foster's penultimate major film appearance before taking a sabbatical from acting to attend [[Yale]]. It received several positive reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success grossing $7,470,348 in North America. The film has attained a [[cult film|cult [[cult following|status]] and is often cited amongst the greatest teenage-centric films.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of four teenage girls in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during the end of the 1970s have painful emotional troubles. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is a [[disco]] queen who is fascinated by her sexuality, likes boys and has many relationship troubles. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) is unhappily overweight and angry that she is still a virgin. Her parents are overprotective, and she has an annoying younger sister. Annie ([[Cherie Currie]]) is a teenage runaway who drinks, uses drugs, and runs away from her abusive [[police officer]] father. Jeanie ([[Jodie Foster]]) feels she has to take care of them all, is fighting with her divorced mother, and is yearning for a closer relationship with her distant father, a [[tour manager]] for the rock band [[Angel (band)|Angel]].\n\nThe girls believe school is a waste of time, their boyfriends are immature, and that they are alienated from the adults in their lives. All four seem immersed in the decadence of the late 1970s. The only way for them to loosen up and forget the bad things happening in their lives is to party and have fun. Annie is the least responsible, while Jeanie is ready to grow up and wants to stop acting like a child. Jeanie is most worried about Annie and continually takes risks to try to keep Annie clean and safe. Annie's unstable behavior keeps everyone on edge, and finally leads to her death in an automobile accident.\n\nAnnie's death brings changes for the rest of the girls. Madge marries Jay ([[Randy Quaid]]), an older man who deflowered her, Deirdre no longer acts boy-crazy, and Jeanie graduates from high school and is about to head off to college. After Madge and Jay's wedding, Jeanie visits Annie's grave and smokes a cigarette. With a smile, she muses that Annie wanted to be buried under a pear tree, \"not in a box or anything\", so that each year her friends could come by, have a pear and say, \"Annie's tastin' good this year, huh?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Jeanie\n* [[Scott Baio]] as Brad\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Jay\n* [[Sally Kellerman]] as Mary\n* [[Cherie Currie]] as Annie Mallick\n* Marilyn Kagan as Madge Axman\n* Kandice Stroh as Deirdre Tompkins\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Axman\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Debbie\n* [[Robert Romanus]] as Scott\n* [[Adam Faith]] as Bryan\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received an approval rating of 67% from 9 reviews of [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/foxes|title= Foxes (1980)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nNoted film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a good review, writing:<blockquote>\nThe movie follows its four foxes through several days and several adventures. It's a loosely structured film, deliberately episodic to suggest the shapeless form of these teen-agers' typical days and nights. Things happen on impulse. Stuff comes up. Kids stay out all night, or run away, or get drunk, or get involved in what's supposed to be a civilized dinner party until it's crashed by a mob of greasers.\n\nThe subject of the movie is the way these events are seen so very differently by the kids and their parents. And at the heart of the movie is one particular, wonderful, and complicated parent-child relationship, between [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Sally Kellerman]]. They only have a few extended scenes together, but the material is written and acted with such sensitivity that we really understand the relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/foxes-1980|author=Ebert, Roger|title=FOXES|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1 January 1980}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe film received several other positive reviews and earned $7,470,348 domestically.<ref name=\"richard\">{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Nowell|title=Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|publisher=Continuum|date=2011|page=260}}</ref>\n\n==DVD==\n''Foxes'' was released in a Region 1 DVD by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 5, 2003.

It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated. Their form was not as good in the second half of the season, and they were overtaken by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] with two games remaining. Even though Steaua crushed [[FC Gloria Buz\u0103u|Gloria Buzau]] 5\u20130 in the last matchday, it was not enough to bring the title to Ghencea, since CFR won the derby against [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]] and won the title, becoming the first team outside [[Bucharest]] to win the title in nearly two decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/14/championsleague.anorthosisfamagusta|title=Minnows from Transylvania to Cyprus take a bite of the big time|first=Amy|last=Lawrence|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=3 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Three days later CFR Cluj completed a league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]], beating [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]] in the [[2008 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei Final|Romanian Cup final]].\n\nBy winning the league, CFR Cluj qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League season]].

The Romanian Cup was kept for a consecutive year at Cluj, and thus they played against Unirea Urziceni(the Liga 1 champions that season) in the Supercupa Romaniei. CFR became the first club not from Bucharest to claim the trophy in [[2009 Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei |2009]].\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Liga I|2009\u201310]] season, the team won the league title for the second time in its history, exhibiting the heavy investments in the club's infrastructure, management, and squad transfers. Managed by coach [[Andrea Mandorlini]], CFR Cluj also kept the Romanian Cup and qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage. As a premier, the 2009\u20132010 CFR Fans' Trophy was awarded to [[Cristian Panin]] as voted by supporters and football reviewers.

({{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283efe\u02ccre \u02c8klu\u0292}} or {{IPA-ro|\u02cct\u0361\u0283efere \u02c8klu\u0292|}}), is a Romanian professional [[association football|football]] [[football team|club]] based in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Cluj County]]. It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated. Their form was not as good in the second half of the season, and they were overtaken by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] with two games remaining. Even though Steaua crushed [[FC Gloria Buz\u0103u|Gloria Buzau]] 5\u20130 in the last matchday, it was not enough to bring the title to Ghencea, since CFR won the derby against [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]] and won the title, becoming the first team outside [[Bucharest]] to win the title in nearly two decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/14/championsleague.anorthosisfamagusta|title=Minnows from Transylvania to Cyprus take a bite of the big time|first=Amy|last=Lawrence|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=3 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Three days later CFR Cluj completed a league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]], beating [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]] in the [[2008 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei Final|Romanian Cup final]].\n\nBy winning the league, CFR Cluj qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League season]].

The Romanian Cup was kept for a consecutive year at Cluj, and thus they played against Unirea Urziceni(the Liga 1 champions that season) in the Supercup. CFR became the first club not from Bucharest to claim the [[2009 Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei |2009]].\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Liga I|2009\u201310]] season, the team won the league title for the second time in its history, exhibiting the heavy investments in the club's infrastructure, management, and squad transfers. Managed by coach [[Andrea Mandorlini]], CFR Cluj also kept the Romanian Cup and qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage. As a premier, the 2009\u20132010 CFR Fans' Trophy was awarded to [[Cristian Panin]] as voted by supporters and football reviewers.

The Albanian Subversion aimed to move Albania from the communist bloc to the Western side.]]\n\nThe '''Albanian Subversion''' ({{Lang-sq|P\u00ebrmbysja e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb}}) is one of the earliest and most notable failures of the Western [[Covert operation|covert]] paramilitary operations in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] launched a joint subversive operation, using as agents [[Albanians|Albanian]] expatriates. Other anti-communist Albanians and many nationalists worked as agents for [[Greece|Greek]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] intelligence services, some supported by the UK and U.S. secret services. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and, later, other spies tipped off the missions to [[Moscow]], which in turn relayed the information to Albania. Consequently, many of the agents were caught, put on trial, and either shot or condemned to long prison terms at [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Albanian subversion cost the lives of at least 300 men and for a long time was one of the most carefully concealed secrets of the [[Cold War]]. In 2006, some 2,300 pages of documents laying out major parts of the Albania Project under its two major cryptonyms, BGFIEND and OBOPUS, were declassified by a U.S. government interagency working group acting under the terms of the [[Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group|Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act]]. These documents are available at the [[College Park (Maryland)|National Archives in College Park, Maryland]].<ref>Within Record Group 263. A user's guide is available to assist researchers in locating the documents.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe reason behind the operation in [[Albanian People's Republic|Albania]] was that Albania was separated from the rest of the [[Soviet Bloc]] by [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which had [[Tito-Stalin split|split with the Soviet Union]] in June 1948. Albania was also the poorest [[Europe]]an nation, and was home to about one million people, many still divided along semi-feudal and (especially in remote areas) tribal lines. There were three major religious groups and two distinct classes: those people who owned land and claimed feudal privileges and those who did not. The landowners, only about 1% of the population, held 95% of the cultivated land as well as the principal ruling posts in the country's central and southern regions.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Albanian society was split into several amorphous groups: nationalists, communists, [[Balli Kombetar|royalists]], traditionalists - the latter both tribal and feudal in nature. It was the Communist-led [[National Liberation Front (Albania)|National Liberation Front]] that emerged victorious, mainly due to the ideological discipline instilled in their troops, but also because they were the only force which had consistently fought the Italians and Germans; many nationalists and the royalists had collaborated with Italian or German occupiers during the war.\n\nHowever, Albania was in an unenviable position after World War II. [[Greece]] hungered for Albanian lands it claimed, while Yugoslavia wanted Albania merged into a Balkan confederation. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] recognized neither [[King Zog]] nor a republican government-in-exile, nor did they ever raise the question of Albania or its borders at major wartime conferences. No reliable statistics on Albania's wartime losses exist, but the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] reported about 30,000 Albanian dead from the war, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people made homeless, numbers whose significance is further compounded by the relatively small population of Albania: approximately 1,000,000 in 1938.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm | title=the Casualties Section | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134810/http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm| archivedate= 24 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses.\n\n==Operational plans==\n{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}\nIn this post-war chaos of 1949 the allies decided to launch their operation. The plan called for parachute drops of royalists into the [[Mat District|Mati]] region in Central Albania. The region was traditionally known as a bastion of Albanian traditionalism and moreover praised for their loyalty to [[King Zog]], himself an offspring of one of the regional clans. The original plan was that, if [[United Kingdom|Britain]] could parachute in enough well-trained agents, they could organize a massive popular revolt, which the allies would supply by air drops. In time, this revolt would spill out a [[civil war]]. The trouble that this would cause the Soviet politics was considered by the British to be worth the risk, and if it did succeed, then it could be the starting point of a chain reaction of popular revolutions throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The project appeared so appealing that the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) had no hesitation in putting it into operation. It was run in detail by an agent who had come into SIS and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE). The chief of SIS, [[Stewart Menzies]], was not enthusiastic about the paramilitary operation but saw it as a way to appease the former SOE \u201cstinks and bangs people.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the British wanted the [[United States]] to finance the operation and to provide bases. Senior British intelligence officer [[William Goodenough Hayter|William Hayter]], who chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee ([[Joint Intelligence Center|JIC]]), came to [[Washington, D.C.]] in March with a group of Secret Intelligence Service members and [[Foreign Office]] staff that included [[Gladwyn Jebb]], [[Earl Jellicoe]], and [[Peter Dwyer]] of SIS and a [[Balkans]] specialist. Joined by SIS Washington liaison [[Kim Philby|Harold Adrian 'Kim' Philby]], they met with [[Rob Joyce|Robert Joyce]] of the [[US State Department]]\u2019s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy and Planning Staff]] (PPS) and [[Frank Wisner]], who was the head of the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC), and other U.S. intelligence officials such as James McCargar and [[Franklin Lindsay]]. McCargar was assigned to liaise with Philby on joint operational matters.  Unbeknownst to the SIS and CIA, though, Philby was a [[Communism|communist]], and [[espionage|spy]] for [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet foreign intelligence]].\n\nThere was no scarcity of anti-communist Albanians and the recruiters promptly found them in the Displaced Persons camps in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Turkey]]. The manpower recruitment for what the British codenamed [[VALUABLE Project]] and the Americans [[FIEND]], consisted of 40% from the [[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]] (BK) National Front, an organization formed during World War II on a nationalist program committed to creating a [[Greater Albania]]; 40% from the monarchist movement, known as [[Legaliteti]]; and the rest from other Albanian factions.\n\n== Valuable Project/Fiend  ==\n{{see also|\"Free Albania\" National Committee}}\n\nA dozen Albanian [[emigr\u00e9]]s were recruited and taken to [[Libya]] to train for a pilot project that would become known as Operation Valuable (It is not clear exactly when MI6 assigned the VALUABLE cryptonym to the Albanian effort). The SIS, with U.S. Army Col. 'Ace' Miller as a liaison, trained these men in the use of weapons, codes and radio, the techniques of subversion and sabotage. They were dropped into the mountains of [[Mat District|Mati]] throughout 1947, but failed to impress the inhabitants of the region into a larger revolt. The operation dragged on until 1949. There were sabotage attempts on the [[Kucova]] [[oilfields]] and the [[copper]] mines in [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]] but no real success in raising a revolt. Then, the US government weighing up the political situation, decided to lend a hand. In September 1949, British foreign secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] went to Washington, D.C. to discuss Operation Valuable with US government officials. The CIA released a report that concluded that \u201ca purely internal Albanian uprising at this time is not indicated, and, if undertaken, would have little chance of success.\u201d The CIA asserted that the [[Enver Hoxha]] regime had a 65,000 man regular army and a security force of 15,000. There were intelligence reports that there were 1,500 Soviet \u201cadvisers\u201d and 4,000 \u201ctechnicians\u201d in Albania helping to train the [[Albanian Army]].\n\nBritish and U.S. naval officials were concerned that the USSR was building a [[submarine base]] at the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Peninsula]] near the port of [[Vlora]]. On September 6, 1949, when [[NATO]] met for the first time in Washington, Bevin proposed that \u201ca counter-revolution\u201d be launched in Albania. US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] was in agreement. NATO, established as a defensive military alliance for Western Europe and North America, was now committed to launching offensive covert operations against a sovereign nation in the [[Balkans]]. The U.S. and UK, joining with their weak allies, Italy and Greece, agreed to support the overthrow of the Hoxha regime in Albania and to eliminate Soviet influence in the [[Mediterranean]] region. Bevin wanted to place King Zog on the throne as the leader of Albania once Hoxha was overthrown.\n\nThis time a better class of [[commando]] was sought so an approach was made to King Zog in exile in [[Cairo]] to recommend men for the job. But British negotiator [[Billy McLean (politician)|Neil 'Billy' McLean]] and American representatives Robert Miner and Robert Low were unable to bring Zog in because no one would name him head of a provisional government in exile. In August 1949, an announcement was made in Paris that Albanian political exiles had formed a multiparty committee to foment anticommunist rebellion in the homeland; actually the [[\"Free Albania\" National Committee]] was created by American diplomatic and intelligence officials for political cover to a covert paramilitary project, with British concurrence. The British made the first organizational move, hiring on as chief trainer Major [[David Smiley]], deputy commander of a [[cavalry]] ([[tank]]) regiment stationed in Germany. Already agreed with McLean and his cohort, [[Julian Amery]], to supply 30 Albanian emigres as recruits for the operation to penetrate Albania were leaders of the Balli Kombetar, an exile political group whose key policy was to replace the Albanian Communist regime with a non-royalist government.\n\n[[File:Malta - Rabat - Fort Bingemma 06 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Bin\u0121emma]], where Albanian recruits were trained.]]\nIn July 1949, the first group of 30 Albanian recruits, some veterans of World War II guerrilla and civil wars, were recruited by Balli Kombetar leaders and transported by British special operations personnel to [[Fort Bin\u0121emma]], on the British island colony of Malta.  Labeled as \"The Pixies\" by the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]], the Pixies spent two months training as radio operators, intelligence gatherers, and more sophisticated guerrillas than they had been as members of cetas (guerrilla bands) during World War II. On September 26, 1949, nine Pixies boarded a British Navy trawler which sailed north; three days later, a Greek style fishing boat, known as a [[ca\u00efque]] and named \"Stormie Seas', sailed from Malta.\n\nWith a stop at an Italian port, the two vessels sailed October 3, rendezvoused at a point in the Adriatic Sea, and transferred the Albanians to the ca\u00efque. Hours later that same night, the Pixies landed on the Albanian coast, some south of Vlora, which was the former territory of the Balli Kombetar, others further north. This was the start of Operation Valuable. Albanian government security forces soon interdicted one of the two groups into which the commandos had split. The Communists killed three members of the first group, and a fourth man with the second group. The first three deaths and disappearance of a fourth man to join his family wiped out one group, while the surviving four from the first 1949 covert landing exfiltrated south to [[Greece]].\n\nFor two years after this landing, small groups of British-trained Albanians left every so often from training camps in [[Malta]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]. Most of the entire series of operations was a disaster, with Albanian security forces interdicting many of the insurgents. Occasionally, the Albanian authorities would report on \u201clarge but unsuccessful infiltrations of enemies of the people\u201d in several regions of the country. It must also be pointed out that some British, Italian, and Greek agents infiltrated Albania two, three and four times each, a pattern that followed Albanian exiles who worked as intelligence gatherers for the Italian Navy. Some American agents, originally trained by Italian or Greek officials, also infiltrated by air, sea, or afoot on more than two occasions, to gather intelligence rather than take part in political or paramilitary operations.\n\nThe last infiltration took place a few weeks before [[Easter]] 1952. In a desperate effort to discover what was going on Captain Shehu himself, with [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Branica and radio operator Tahir Prenci, were guided by veteran gendarme and guerrilla fighter Hamit Matjani and three armed guards to the Mati region northeast of Tirana, the region once home to Albania's ex-King Zog. Albanian security forces [[militia]] were waiting for them at their rendezvous point, a house owned by Shehu's cousin, a known supporter of Zog. The militia forced Shehu's operator to transmit an all clear signal to his base in Cyprus. The operator had been schooled to deal with such situations  by using a fail-safe drill which involved broadcasting in a way that warned it was being sent under duress and therefore should be disregarded. But the militia seemed to know the drill. The all clear signal went out and, nearly a year later, four more top agents, including Matjani himself, parachuted into an ambush at Shen Gjergj (Saint George), near the town of [[Elbasan]]. The Albanian army was waiting in a big circle, guns cocked, and the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] landed in the middle of it. No one surrendered. Those not killed were tried in April 1954.\n\nIn the 2009 RT\u00c9 (Irish) television programme [[Who_Do_You_Think_You_Are%3F_(Irish_TV_series)|\"Who Do You Think You Are?\"]] British Colonel Charles Davison's wife Maeve (n\u00e9e de Burgh - mother of [[Chris de Burgh]]) reveals that Davison was posted to Malta in the early 1950s.  When asked what the posting involved, Maeve replies \"He was offered a posting in Malta. It was officially Army work but in fact it was intelligence work. He was training agents to be put into Albania. And he was teaching them how to... blow things up and generally cause lots of destruction.\"\n \nMrs. Davison wrote a letter on 21 May 1952 telling the Army that Col Davison was no longer interested in a job he had been inquiring about because he had already left for another posting.  The letter is contained in Davison's official war records and was shown on the programme. The location of the posting is not stated in the letter but when questioned about where it was, Maeve Davison confirms it was Malta. Maeve Davison says she joined her husband in Malta and acted as a cypher clerk - encoding and decoding messages about the operations and forwarding them to London. Her letter and comments on the programme indicate the British operation did not cease but continued on Malta in 1952 and later under Colonel Charles Davison.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{see also|Company 4000}}\nShehu, Sufa, Matjani and others were put on trial, which found all guilty as charged. Shehu, Sula and the royal guards were to be shot, Matjani to be hanged.  Many of the local inhabitants who were suspected of having helped the guerrillas, were jailed or forcibly located elsewhere in Albania. Whatever remained of the anticommunist resistance was virtually erased.\n\nThose guerrillas who survived had no doubt they were betrayed: \u201cPolice were always waiting when a boat came ashore. How could they know where the boats would come unless a traitor would have told them? Also, people who had been our friends when we left Albania were often no longer our friends when we went back.\u201d\n\nUp to 300 agents and civilians who helped them were likely killed during the operation. [[Abaz Ermenji]], co-founder of Balli Kombetar (BK) stated: \u201cOur \u2018allies\u2019 wanted to make use of Albania as a guinea-pig, without caring about the human losses, for an absurd enterprise that was condemned to failure.\u201d  [[Halil Nerguti]] stated: \u201cWe were used as an experiment. We were a small part of a big game, pawns that could be sacrificed.\u201d There is no question that the CIA and MI6 used the operation as a small-scale exercise in regime change. The stakes were small. Failure would not be noticed. [[John H. Richardson (CIA)|John H. Richardson Sr]], Director of the CIA's South-East Division, terminated Operation Fiend. By 1954, [[Company 4000]]'s 120 members focused on guarding a [[United States Air Force]] chemical weapons dump south of [[Munich]]; CIA training facilities outside [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] shut down, as did a CIA base on a Greek island. Over time, the remaining Albanians were resettled in the US, UK, and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.\n\nDuring the summer of 1993, one of the ex-American agents, Shaqir Kabashi, an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo, traveled to Albania in hopes of finding skeletonized remains of his brother. He believed the sibling had been shot to death during a 1951 covert operation for the U.S. OPC.  The story Kabashi had been told by an Albanian newly emigrated to the U.S. was that remains of CIA agents were buried on a hillside near the city of Fier. Using a good amount of his own retirement money, Kabashi recruited a gang of men from a nearby village, who dug several pits in a hillside meadow. Human remains were found in one pit, Kabashi later told a Reuters stringer. Firmly persuaded he had his brother's remains, Shaqir had most of the skeletons buried in a courtyard of a nearby mosque. He carried a few samples of bones on his flight back to the U.S.  But despite suggestions that he seek U.S. Government aid in getting DNA analysis, Shaqir died in November 1997 without confirming he had found his late brother.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Banda Mustafaj]]\n* [[Anti-Communism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'', 2006\n* {{cite book |author =[[Nicholas Bethell]]|title=Betrayed |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=0-8129-1188-1 |oclc=2215298  |doi=}}\n* Colonel [[David Smiley]] LVO, OBE, MC, \"Irregular Regular\", Michael Russell, Norwich, 1994 ({{ISBN|0-85955-202-0}}).

The Albanian Subversion aimed to move Albania from the communist bloc to the Western side.]]\n\nThe '''Albanian Subversion''' ({{Lang-sq|P\u00ebrmbysja e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb}}) is one of the earliest and most notable failures of the Western [[Covert operation|covert]] paramilitary operations in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] launched a joint subversive operation, using as agents [[Albanians|Albanian]] expatriates. Other anti-communist Albanians and many nationalists worked as agents for [[Greece|Greek]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] intelligence services, some supported by the UK and U.S. secret services. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and, later, other spies tipped off the missions to [[Moscow]], which in turn relayed the information to Albania. Consequently, many of the agents were caught, put on trial, and either shot or condemned to long prison terms at [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Albanian subversion cost the lives of at least 300 men and for a long time was one of the most carefully concealed secrets of the [[Cold War]]. In 2006, some 2,300 pages of documents laying out major parts of the Albania Project under its two major cryptonyms, BGFIEND and OBOPUS, were declassified by a U.S. government interagency working group acting under the terms of the [[Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group|Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act]]. These documents are available at the [[College Park (Maryland)|National Archives in College Park, Maryland]].<ref>Within Record Group 263. A user's guide is available to assist researchers in locating the documents.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe reason behind the operation in [[Albanian People's Republic|Albania]] was that Albania was separated from the rest of the [[Soviet Bloc]] by [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which had [[Tito-Stalin split|split with the Soviet Union]] in June 1948. Albania was also the poorest [[Europe]]an nation, and was home to about one million people, many still divided along semi-feudal and (especially in remote areas) tribal lines. There were three major religious groups and two distinct classes: those people who owned land and claimed feudal privileges and those who did not. The landowners, only about 1% of the population, held 95% of the cultivated land as well as the principal ruling posts in the country's central and southern regions.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Albanian society was split into several amorphous groups: nationalists, communists, [[Balli Kombetar|royalists]], traditionalists - the latter both tribal and feudal in nature. It was the Communist-led [[National Liberation Front (Albania)|National Liberation Front]] that emerged victorious, mainly due to the ideological discipline instilled in their troops, but also because they were the only force which had consistently fought the Italians and Germans; many nationalists and the royalists had collaborated with Italian or German occupiers during the war.\n\nHowever, Albania was in an unenviable position after World War II. [[Greece]] hungered for Albanian lands it claimed, while Yugoslavia wanted Albania merged into a Balkan confederation. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] recognized neither [[King Zog]] nor a republican government-in-exile, nor did they ever raise the question of Albania or its borders at major wartime conferences. No reliable statistics on Albania's wartime losses exist, but the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] reported about 30,000 Albanian dead from the war, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people made homeless, numbers whose significance is further compounded by the relatively small population of Albania: approximately 1,000,000 in 1938.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm | title=the Casualties Section | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134810/http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm| archivedate= 24 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses.\n\n==Operational plans==\n{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}\nIn this post-war chaos of 1949 the allies decided to launch their operation. The plan called for parachute drops of royalists into the [[Mat District|Mati]] region in Central Albania. The region was traditionally known as a bastion of Albanian traditionalism and moreover praised for their loyalty to [[King Zog]], himself an offspring of one of the regional clans. The original plan was that, if [[United Kingdom|Britain]] could parachute in enough well-trained agents, they could organize a massive popular revolt, which the allies would supply by air drops. In time, this revolt would spill out a [[civil war]]. The trouble that this would cause the Soviet politics was considered by the British to be worth the risk, and if it did succeed, then it could be the starting point of a chain reaction of popular revolutions throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The project appeared so appealing that the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) had no hesitation in putting it into operation. It was run in detail by an agent who had come into SIS and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE). The chief of SIS, [[Stewart Menzies]], was not enthusiastic about the paramilitary operation but saw it as a way to appease the former SOE \u201cstinks and bangs people.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the British wanted the [[United States]] to finance the operation and to provide bases. Senior British intelligence officer [[William Goodenough Hayter|William Hayter]], who chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee ([[Joint Intelligence Center|JIC]]), came to [[Washington, D.C.]] in March with a group of Secret Intelligence Service members and [[Foreign Office]] staff that included [[Gladwyn Jebb]], [[Earl Jellicoe]], and [[Peter Dwyer]] of SIS and a [[Balkans]] specialist. Joined by SIS Washington liaison [[Kim Philby|Harold Adrian 'Kim' Philby]], they met with [[Rob Joyce|Robert Joyce]] of the [[US State Department]]\u2019s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy and Planning Staff]] (PPS) and [[Frank Wisner]], who was the head of the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC), and other U.S. intelligence officials such as James McCargar and [[Franklin Lindsay]]. McCargar was assigned to liaise with Philby on joint operational matters.  Unbeknownst to the SIS and CIA, though, Philby was a [[Communism|communist]], and [[espionage|spy]] for [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet foreign intelligence]].\n\nThere was no scarcity of anti-communist Albanians and the recruiters promptly found them in the Displaced Persons camps in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Turkey]]. The manpower recruitment for what the British codenamed [[VALUABLE Project]] and the Americans [[FIEND]], consisted of 40% from the [[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]] (BK) National Front, an organization formed during World War II on a nationalist program committed to creating a [[Greater Albania]]; 40% from the monarchist movement, known as [[Legaliteti]]; and the rest from other Albanian factions.\n\n== Valuable Project/Fiend  ==\n{{see also|\"Free Albania\" National Committee}}\n\nA dozen Albanian [[emigr\u00e9]]s were recruited and taken to [[Libya]] to train for a pilot project that would become known as Operation Valuable (It is not clear exactly when MI6 assigned the VALUABLE cryptonym to the Albanian effort). The SIS, with U.S. Army Col. 'Ace' Miller as a liaison, trained these men in the use of weapons, codes and radio, the techniques of subversion and sabotage. They were dropped into the mountains of [[Mat District|Mati]] throughout 1947, but failed to impress the inhabitants of the region into a larger revolt. The operation dragged on until 1949. There were sabotage attempts on the [[Kucova]] [[oilfields]] and the [[copper]] mines in [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]] but no real success in raising a revolt. Then, the US government weighing up the political situation, decided to lend a hand. In September 1949, British foreign secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] went to Washington, D.C. to discuss Operation Valuable with US government officials. The CIA released a report that concluded that \u201ca purely internal Albanian uprising at this time is not indicated, and, if undertaken, would have little chance of success.\u201d The CIA asserted that the [[Enver Hoxha]] regime had a 65,000 man regular army and a security force of 15,000. There were intelligence reports that there were 1,500 Soviet \u201cadvisers\u201d and 4,000 \u201ctechnicians\u201d in Albania helping to train the [[Albanian Army]].\n\nBritish and U.S. naval officials were concerned that the USSR was building a [[submarine base]] at the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Peninsula]] near the port of [[Vlora]].

By 1954, [[Company 4000]]'s 120 members focused on guarding a [[United States Air Force]] chemical weapons dump south of [[Munich]]; CIA training facilities outside [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] shut down, as did a CIA base on a Greek island. Over time, the remaining Albanians were resettled in the US, UK, and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.\n\nDuring the summer of 1993, one of the ex-American agents, Shaqir Kabashi, an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo, traveled to Albania in hopes of finding skeletonized remains of his brother. He believed the sibling had been shot to death during a 1951 covert operation for the U.S. OPC.  The story Kabashi had been told by an Albanian newly emigrated to the U.S. was that remains of CIA agents were buried on a hillside near the city of Fier. Using a good amount of his own retirement money, Kabashi recruited a gang of men from a nearby village, who dug several pits in a hillside meadow. Human remains were found in one pit, Kabashi later told a Reuters stringer. Firmly persuaded he had his brother's remains, Shaqir had most of the skeletons buried in a courtyard of a nearby mosque. He carried a few samples of bones on his flight back to the U.S.  But despite suggestions that he seek U.S. Government aid in getting DNA analysis, Shaqir died in November 1997 without confirming he had found his late brother.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Banda Mustafaj]]\n* [[Anti-Communism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'', 2006\n* {{cite book |author =[[Nicholas Bethell]]|title=Betrayed |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=0-8129-1188-1 |oclc=2215298  |doi=}}\n* Colonel [[David Smiley]] LVO, OBE, MC, \"Irregular Regular\", Michael Russell, Norwich, 1994 ({{ISBN|0-85955-202-0}}).

Turkana warriors were thus sent forward to capture one of these strange beasts, which the dreamer said looked 'like giraffes, but with humps on their backs'. The young men therefore went and captured one of these beasts - the first camels the Turkana had seen. The owners of the strange beasts appear to have struck the Turkana as strange as well. The Turkana saw them as 'red' people, partly because of their lighter skin and partly because they daubed their hair and bodies with reddish clay. They thus gave them the name 'Kor'. Lamphear states that Turkana traditions agree that the Kor were very numerous and lived in close pastoral association with two other communities known as 'Rantalle' and 'Poran'. These are analogous with the present day [[Rendille people|Rendille]] and [[Borana Oromo people|Boran]] communities.<ref name =lamphear />\n\nAccording to Von H\u00f6hnel (1894) \"a few decades\" prior, the Burkineji occupied districts on the west of the lake and that they were later driven eastwards into present day Samburu. He later states that \"some fifty years ago the Turkana owned part of the land on the west now occupied by the Karamoyo, whilst the southern portion of their land belonged to the Burkineji. The Karamoyo drove the Turkana further east, and the Turkana, in their turn, pushed the Burkineji towards Samburuland\".<ref name=hohnel />\n\nAt the time of Von H\u00f6hnel's visit the Burkineji and 'Randille' had previously frequented the shores of the lake but had stopped as at that time due to frequent attacks by the Turkana.\n\n==Loikop==\nAccording to traditions recorded by MacDonald, the Loikop society fragmented as it expanded from a territory located east of Lake Turkana. This led to the development of three groupings within Loikop society. The [[Samburu people|Sambur]] who occupied the 'original' country east of Lake Turkana as well as the Laikipia plateau.

Pelekee which loomed up in the distance directly before them...\n|John Lamphear, 1988<ref name =lamphear>{{cite journal |last=Lamphear |first=John |date=1988 |title=The People of the Grey Bull: The Origin and Expansion of the Turkana |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=30 |jstor=182237 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nLamphear notes that Tukana traditions aver that a dreamer among them saw strange animals living with the people up in the hills. Turkana warriors were thus sent forward to capture one of these strange beasts, which the dreamer said looked 'like giraffes, but with humps on their backs'. The young men therefore went and captured one of these beasts - the first camels the Turkana had seen. The owners of the strange beasts appear to have struck the Turkana as strange as well. The Turkana saw them as 'red' people, partly because of their lighter skin and partly because they daubed their hair and bodies with reddish clay. They thus gave them the name 'Kor'. Lamphear states that Turkana traditions agree that the Kor were very numerous and lived in close pastoral association with two other communities known as 'Rantalle' and 'Poran'. These are analogus with the preset day [[Rendille people|Rendille]] and [[Borana Oromo people|Boran]] communities.<ref name =lamphear />\n\nAccording to Von H\u00f6hnel (1894) \"a few decades\" prior, the Burkineji occupied districts on the west of the lake and that they were later driven eastwards into present day Samburu. He later states that \"some fifty years ago the Turkana owned part of the land on the west now occupied by the Karamoyo, whilst the southern portion of their land belonged to the Burkineji. The Karamoyo drove the Turkana further east, and the Turkana, in their turn, pushed the Burkineji towards Samburuland\".<ref name=hohnel />\n\nAt the time of Von H\u00f6hnel's visit the Burkineji and 'Randille' had previously frequented the shores of the lake but had stopped as at that time due to frequent attacks by the Turkana.\n\n==Loikop==\nAccording to traditions recorded by MacDonald, the Loikop society fragmented as it expanded from a territory located east of Lake Turkana. This led to the development of three groupings within Loikop society. The [[Samburu people|Sambur]] who occupied the 'original' country east of Lake Turkana as well as the Laikipia plateau. The [[Uasin Gishu people|Uasin Gishu]] occupied the grass plateaus of the Uasin Gishu and Mau while the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] territory extended from Naivasha to Kilimanjaro.<ref>{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=J.R.L |date=1899 |title=Notes on the Ethnology of Tribes Met with During Progress of the Juba Expedition of 1897-99 |journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=29 |issue=3/4 |pages=240 |doi=10.2307/2843005 |jstor=2843005 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2138272 }}</ref> \n\n===Rendile - Sambur conflict===\n\n{{quote box\n| title =\n| quote = The Sambur of Lykipia, weakened by war and isolation and impoverished by cattle plague, were in turn subject to attacks by the Rendille, and are now almost if not quite destroyed.\n| source = \u2014 MacDonald, 1889 <ref>{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=J.R.L |date=1899 |title=Notes on the Ethnology of Tribes Met with During Progress of the Juba Expedition of 1897-99 |journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=29 |issue=3/4 |pages=240 |doi=10.2307/2843005 |jstor=2843005 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2138272 }}</ref>\n\n| align = center\n| width = 90%\n| fontsize = 85%\n| bgcolor = AliceBlue\n| title_bg =\n| title_fnt =\n| tstyle = text-align: left;\n| qalign = right\n| qstyle = text-align: left;\n| quoted = yes\n| salign = right\n| style = text-align: right;}}\n\n===Small-pox===\nArkell-Hardwick records that the Burkineji survived a small-pox epidemic, which seems to have affected their neighbors earlier, by sending the young men away to different camps. The Rendille, previously powerful, had not been so fortunate and had been greatly impacted by the epidemic. By the time of Arkell-Hardwick's writing they had come under the protection of the Burkineji who \"were perfectly wiling to protect the Rendili, but in return they considered that they ought to be allowed the right to help themselves from the Rendili flocks...\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Arkell-Hardwick |first=Alfred |date=1903 |title=An Ivory Trader in North Kenia: The Record of an Expedition Through Kikuyu to Galla-land in East Equatorial Africa |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, and co. |page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Somali conflict===\nArkell-Hardwick, an ivory hunter who visited north Kenya in at the turn of the 19th century wrote of a 'Burkineji' community living in association with a community he referred to as [[Rendille people|'Rendili']]. He records that at some prior point the 'Burkineji and Rendili' had allied together to fight the Ogaden Somali. During this conflict the Somali were armed with old muzzle-loading guns, using very inferior powder and spherical bullets which \"..The Rendili declared...they were able to stop or turn...using their shields\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Arkell-Hardwick |first=Alfred |date=1903 |title=An Ivory Trader in North Kenia: The Record of an Expedition Through Kikuyu to Galla-land in East Equatorial Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/anivorytraderin00hardgoog |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, and co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/anivorytraderin00hardgoog/page/n257 221]}}</ref>\n\n==Late-19th century==\nArkell-Hardwick made note of Von Honnel's mention of \"Rendili inhabiting the largest of the three islands in the south end of (Lake Turkana), the other two being occupied by Burkineji and Reshiat. He also speaks of settlements of mixed Rendili and Burkineji in the western portion of the Reshiat country, at the north end of the lake..\". He notes that at the time, there were populations of Burkineji on 'Mount Nyiro' where they had settled to escape attacks by the Turkana.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arkell-Hardwick |first=Alfred |date=1903 |title=An Ivory Trader in North Kenia: The Record of an Expedition Through Kikuyu to Galla-land in East Equatorial Africa |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, and co. |page=222}}</ref>   \n\n===Turkana raids===\nIn May 1888, Von Honnel heard from a Burkineji woman that the Turkana had suffered a severe scarcity about three months before then, it seems these prompted raids on the Burkineji and Rendille. The second of these raids, during which the Turkana captured a number of livestock, had recently occurred and as a result \"all the people of the plundered districts, Burkineji and Randille alike, had combined to make an incursion on Turkana\".\n\n===Way of life===\nThe Burkineji were pastoralists and had large herds of donkeys, though at least as of the late 19th century, they did not keep horses as their neighbors the [[Rendille people|Rendille]] did.\n\nMost of the Burkineji of the late 19th century, wore cloth referred to as \"lassos\" of which they had a preference for gaudily colored types. They spoke Masai but most understood the Rendille language.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arkell-Hardwick |first=Alfred |date=1903 |title=An Ivory Trader in North Kenia: The Record of an Expedition Through Kikuyu to Galla-land in East Equatorial Africa |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, and co. |page=223}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Kenyan people by ethnic or national origin]]\n[[Category:Pastoralists]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "c/e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkineji_people"}
