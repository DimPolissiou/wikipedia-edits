The temporal gap in the development of the socioemotional and cognitive control systems creates a period of heightened vulnerability to risk-taking during mid-adolescence.  In the dual systems model, \"reward sensitivity\" and \"[[Executive functions|cognitive control]]\" refer to neurobiological constructs that are measured in studies of brain structure and function.

The dual systems model proposes an inverted-U shape development of the socioemotional system, such that reward responsivity increases in early adolescence and declines thereafter. The maturational imbalance model portrays a socioemotional system that reaches its peak around mid-adolescence and then plateaus into adulthood. Further, the dual systems model proposes that the development of the cognitive control and socioemotional systems is independent whereas the maturational imbalance proposes that the maturation of the cognitive control system leads to dampening of socioemotional responsivity.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Driven dual systems model ===\nRecently, another variation of the dual systems model was proposed called the \"driven dual systems model\".<ref name=\":1\" /> This model proposes an inverted-U shaped trajectory of socioemotional system responsivity, similar to the dual systems model, but hypothesizes a cognitive control trajectory that plateaus in mid-adolescence. This cognitive control trajectory differs from that proposed by the dual systems model and maturational imbalance model which continues to increase into the early 20s. Similar to the driven dual systems model, a model has been proposed including a hyperactive socioemotional system that undermines the regulatory ability of the cognitive control system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luciana|first=Monica|last2=Collins|first2=Paul F.|date=2012-12-01|title=Incentive Motivation, Cognitive Control, and the Adolescent Brain: Is It Time for a Paradigm Shift?|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=6|issue=4|pages=392\u2013399|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00252.x|issn=1750-8592|pmc=3607661|pmid=23543860}}</ref> These later models hypothesize that cognitive control development is completed by mid-adolescence and attribute increased risk-taking during adolescence to the hyperarousal of the socioemotional system.

The dual systems model proposes an inverted-U shape development of the socioemotional system, such that reward responsivity increases in early adolescence and declines thereafter. The maturational imbalance model portrays a socioemotional system that reaches its peak around mid-adolescence and then plateaus into adulthood.

This cognitive control trajectory differs from that proposed by the dual systems model and maturational imbalance model which continues to increase into the early 20s.

Sometimes the rewards differ on [[probability]], magnitude, or type of reward (e.g., social versus monetary).

It is 35 kilometres west of [[London, Ontario|London]].\n\nStrathroy-Caradoc is a primarily rural municipality. Industries include [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[chicken]] hatching and processing, [[maize|corn]], [[tobacco]], automotive, and pharmaceutical. Some industrial products are manufactured in Strathroy, the township's largest locality and its commercial, cultural and industrial centre. Strathroy's hatcheries have seen it referred to as the turkey capital of Canada and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.com/travelguides/strathroy-on |title=AAA Travel Guide - Strathroy, Ontario |accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>\n\nSettlements within Strathroy-Caradoc largely grew up around the [[Sydenham River]] and the southwestern Ontario railways. Three major railway lines pass through the municipality: the CN ([[Canadian National Railway]]) Chatham Subdivision (connecting [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and London, Ontario), the CP ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) Windsor Subdivision (also connecting Windsor and London), and the CN Strathroy Subdivision (connecting London and [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]]).\n\nMunicipally, Strathroy-Caradoc is within [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]]. At the federal and provincial levels of government it is represented by the riding of [[Lambton\u2014Kent\u2014Middlesex]]. It is part of the [[London, Ontario|London]] [[census metropolitan area]].\n\n==Communities==\nStrathroy-Caradoc's two largest communities are '''Strathroy''' and '''Mount Brydges'''. The township also contains the smaller communities of Cairngorm, Campbellvale, Caradoc, Christina, Falconbridge, Glen Oak, Longwood, Melbourne (part) and Muncey.\n\n===Strathroy===\n'''Strathroy''' is 35 kilometres west of the [[London, Ontario|City of London, Ontario]], and is the largest community in Middlesex County outside London. The community is situated next to [[Ontario Highway 402|Highway 402]] between [[London, Ontario|London]] and the border to [[Port Huron, Michigan]], U.S. at [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]]. Strathroy's economy is diverse, and major industries include automotive [[manufacturing]], [[agriculture]] and [[food processing]].  The township's administrative offices are located in Strathroy.\n\n===Mount Brydges===\n'''Mount Brydges''' has a small commercial \"downtown\" featuring mostly local businesses and shops. Local agriculture includes [[maize]], [[tobacco]] and [[wheat]]. The soil composition of the region is largely sandy (a phenomenon referred to locally as the \"[[Caradoc Sand Plains]]\") as a result of deposits created on the bottom of the glacial [[Lake Whittlesey]] which covered the area approximately 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe village came into existence as a result of the construction of the western division of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railroad]] from [[London, Ontario|City of London, Ontario]] to [[Windsor, Ontario]], at the point where it crossed the existing road from [[Delaware, Ontario]] to Strathroy.  This crossing happened to be at the point of greatest elevation on this division, the railroad having just climbed out of the valley of the Thames River from London.  The station was named for [[Charles John Brydges]] the Managing Director of the Railroad.  Contrary to a previous suggestion, the name had nothing to do with an early settler named Mount who left the area more than two decades earlier.\n\n==History==\nStrathroy was first settled in 1832 by [[John Stewart Buchanan]], accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques, at a location on the [[Sydenham River]] with flow and fall sufficient to power a [[Wiktionary:Gristmill|grist mill]]. A [[general store]] opened in the settlement in 1840. Strathroy was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1860 and became a [[town]] in 1872 under the motto \"We Advance\". Buchanan named the settlement after his hometown of Strathroy in [[Ireland]], now a suburb of [[Omagh]] in [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nIn 1866, ''The Age'' newspaper was established to compete with the already-established Western Dispatch newspaper. The ''Western Dispatch'' was purchased by ''The Age'' in 1923, which later became ''The Age Dispatch''. The newspaper is still published weekly.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1945 the [[Mount Elgin Indian Residential School]] operated in Muncey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memorial.nctr.ca/?p=1324|title=Mount Elgin Residential School \u2013 National Residential School Memorial Register|last=Min|first=Seon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nSir [[Arthur Currie]], who would later become the commander of Canadian forces in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]], was born here on December 5, 1875.\n\nIn the fall of 1876, [[Bixel Brewery]] opened in Strathroy, producing lager beer for a century before its closing. Other breweries in the town have included the \"Western Steam Brewery\", \"Strathroy Brewing and Malting\" and \"West End Brewery\".\n\nIn 1896, the Strathroy Furniture Company opened its doors, and was renowned for nearly a century for making residential furniture. On July 15, 1992, the company declared [[bankruptcy]] and a liquidation sale was held in October 1992.\n\nOn February 14, 1914, the first patients were admitted to what would become [[Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital]]. At the time, the hospital was municipally-owned. The current building opened on June 23, 1962 as a two-story structure with 82 beds.  The hospital was the location at which [[First Nations|Native Canadian]] [[Dudley George]] succumbed to the gunshot wound he suffered at the [[Ipperwash Crisis|Ipperwash Standoff]] at nearby [[Ipperwash Provincial Park]] on September 7, 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=123222&x=articles&s=societe |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927014113/http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=123222&x=articles&s=societe |archive-date=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_TOC.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008125009/http://ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_TOC.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1954, [[West Middlesex Memorial Arena]] opened in Strathroy. To commemorate the occasion, the [[NHL]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] played an exhibition game at the arena, defeating the local [[Western Junior B Hockey League|Junior 'B']] team the [[Strathroy Rockets]] 14\u20133 in front of 3,100 spectators.<ref>[http://www.azhockey.com/We.htm A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey - We<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Strathroy merged with the former township of Caradoc to created the town of Strathroy-Caradoc.\n\nOn March 22, 2004, the town's 117-year-old [[train station]] <ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/03/22/390948.html Blaze claims train station - London Free Press, 22 March 2004]</ref> was destroyed by a fire that took more than 35 [[firefighter]]s to get under control.

It is 35 kilometres west of [[London, Ontario|London]].\n\nStrathroy-Caradoc is a primarily rural municipality. Industries include [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[chicken]] hatching and processing, [[maize|corn]], [[tobacco]], automotive, and pharmaceutical. Some industrial products are manufactured in Strathroy, the township's largest locality and its commercial, cultural and industrial centre. Strathroy's hatcheries have seen it referred to as the turkey capital of Canada and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.com/travelguides/strathroy-on |title=AAA Travel Guide - Strathroy, Ontario |accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>\n\nSettlements within Strathroy-Caradoc largely grew up around the [[Sydenham River]] and the southwestern Ontario railways. Three major railway lines pass through the municipality: the CN ([[Canadian National Railway]]) Chatham Subdivision (connecting [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and London, Ontario), the CP ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) Windsor Subdivision (also connecting Windsor and London), and the CN Strathroy Subdivision (connecting London and [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]]).\n\nMunicipally, Strathroy-Caradoc is within [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]]. At the federal and provincial levels of government it is represented by the riding of [[Lambton\u2014Kent\u2014Middlesex]]. It is part of the [[London, Ontario|London]] [[census metropolitan area]].\n\n==Communities==\nStrathroy-Caradoc's two largest communities are '''Strathroy''' and '''Mount Brydges'''. The township also contains the smaller communities of Cairngorm, Campbellvale, Caradoc, Christina, Falconbridge, Glen Oak, Longwood, Melbourne (part) and Muncey.\n\n===Strathroy===\n'''Strathroy''' is 35 kilometres west of the [[London, Ontario|City of London, Ontario]], and is the largest community in Middlesex County outside London. The community is situated next to [[Ontario Highway 402|Highway 402]] between [[London, Ontario|London]] and the border to [[Port Huron, Michigan]], U.S. at [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]]. Strathroy's economy is diverse, and major industries include automotive [[manufacturing]], [[agriculture]] and [[food processing]].  The township's administrative offices are located in Strathroy.\n\n===Mount Brydges===\n'''Mount Brydges''' has a small commercial \"downtown\" featuring mostly local businesses and shops. Local agriculture includes [[maize]], [[tobacco]] and [[wheat]]. The soil composition of the region is largely sandy (a phenomenon referred to locally as the \"[[Caradoc Sand Plains]]\") as a result of deposits created on the bottom of the glacial [[Lake Whittlesey]] which covered the area approximately 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe village came into existence as a result of the construction of the western division of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railroad]] from [[London, Ontario|City of London, Ontario]] to [[Windsor, Ontario]], at the point where it crossed the existing road from [[Delaware, Ontario]] to Strathroy.  This crossing happened to be at the point of greatest elevation on this division, the railroad having just climbed out of the valley of the Thames River from London.  The station was named for [[Charles John Brydges]] the Managing Director of the Railroad.  Contrary to a previous suggestion, the name had nothing to do with an early settler named Mount who left the area more than two decades earlier.\n\n==History==\nStrathroy was first settled in 1832 by [[John Stewart Buchanan]], accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques, at a location on the [[Sydenham River]] with flow and fall sufficient to power a [[Wiktionary:Gristmill|grist mill]]. A [[general store]] opened in the settlement in 1840. Strathroy was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1860 and became a [[town]] in 1872 under the motto \"We Advance\". Buchanan named the settlement after his hometown of Strathroy in [[Ireland]], now a suburb of [[Omagh]] in [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nIn 1866, ''The Age'' newspaper was established to compete with the already-established Western Dispatch newspaper. The ''Western Dispatch'' was purchased by ''The Age'' in 1923, which later became ''The Age Dispatch''. The newspaper is still published weekly.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1945 the [[Mount Elgin Indian Residential School]] operated in Muncey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://memorial.nctr.ca/?p=1324|title=Mount Elgin Residential School \u2013 National Residential School Memorial Register|last=Min|first=Seon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nSir [[Arthur Currie]], who would later become the commander of Canadian forces in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]], was born here on December 5, 1875.\n\nIn the fall of 1876, [[Bixel Brewery]] opened in Strathroy, producing lager beer for a century before its closing. Other breweries in the town have included the \"Western Steam Brewery\", \"Strathroy Brewing and Malting\" and \"West End Brewery\".\n\nIn 1896, the Strathroy Furniture Company opened its doors, and was renowned for nearly a century for making residential furniture. On July 15, 1992, the company declared [[bankruptcy]] and a liquidation sale was held in October 1992.\n\nOn February 14, 1914, the first patients were admitted to what would become [[Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital]]. At the time, the hospital was municipally-owned. The current building opened on June 23, 1962 as a two-story structure with 82 beds.  The hospital was the location at which [[First Nations|Native Canadian]] [[Dudley George]] succumbed to the gunshot wound he suffered at the [[Ipperwash Crisis|Ipperwash Standoff]] at nearby [[Ipperwash Provincial Park]] on September 7, 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=123222&x=articles&s=societe |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927014113/http://www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=123222&x=articles&s=societe |archive-date=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_TOC.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008125009/http://ipperwashinquiry.ca/report/vol_1/pdf/E_Vol_1_TOC.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1954, [[West Middlesex Memorial Arena]] opened in Strathroy. To commemorate the occasion, the [[NHL]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] played an exhibition game at the arena, defeating the local [[Western Junior B Hockey League|Junior 'B']] team the [[Strathroy Rockets]] 14\u20133 in front of 3,100 spectators.<ref>[http://www.azhockey.com/We.htm A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey - We<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Strathroy merged with the former township of Caradoc to created the town of Strathroy-Caradoc.\n\nOn March 22, 2004, the town's 117-year-old [[train station]] <ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/03/22/390948.html Blaze claims train station - London Free Press, 22 March 2004]</ref> was destroyed by a fire that took more than 35 [[firefighter]]s to get under control.

This ended the town's existing reliance on [[groundwater]] and [[Water well|well]]s.\n\nOn August 10, 2016 an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] supporter from Strathroy, Aaron Driver, was killed in a [[taxi]] outside his home, after being shot by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and detonating one of two homemade bombs. The taxi driver was injured. Police suspected he intended to commit a [[suicide bombing]] in another public place.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/aaron-driver-troubled-childhood-isis-supporter-1.3716222 \"Aaron

GluR1 subunit-containing AMPA receptors are Ca2+ permeable while GluR2/3 subunit-positive receptors are nearly impermeable to calcium ions. In the regulated pathway, GluR1 dimers populate the synapse at a rate proportional to NMDA-ergic Ca2+ influx. In the constitutative pathway, GluR2/3 dimers populate the synapse at a steady state.\n\nThis forms a positive feedback loop, where a small trigger impulse degating NMDA from Mg2+ pore blockade results in calcium influx, this calcium influx then triggers trafficking of GluR1-containing(Ca2+ permeable) subunits to the PSD, such trafficking of GluR1-positive AMPA to the postsynaptic neuron allows for upmodulation of the postsynaptic neuron's calcium influx in response to presynaptic calcium influx. Robust negative feedback at NMDA from kyenurenic acid, magnesium, zinc, and agmatine prevents runaway feedback.\n\nMisregulation of this pathway would sympathetically dysregulate LTP via disruption of NMDA. Such alteration in LTP may play a role, specifically in negative symptoms of schizophrenia, in creation of more broad disruptions such as loss of brain volume; an effect of the disease which antidopaminergics actually worsen, rather than treat.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25802081 |year=2015 |last1=Vita |first1=A |title=The Effect of Antipsychotic Treatment on Cortical Gray Matter Changes in Schizophrenia: Does the Class Matter?

This may indicate a7 pentameter excess as a causative factor, or possibly as a method of self-medication to combat antipsychotic side effects. Cannabidiol, a FAAH inhibitor, increases levels in anandamide and may have antipsychotic effect; though results are mixed here as anandamide also is a cannabinoid and as such displays some psychotomimetic effect. However, a7 nicotinic ''agonists'' have been indicated as potential treatments for schizophrenia, though evidence is somewhat contradictory there is indication a7 nAChR is somehow involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.\n\n==The role of 5-HT==\nThis deficit in activation also results in a decrease in activity of 5-HT1A receptors in the [[raphe nucleus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bantick|first=R.

The [[5-HT1B receptor]], also acting as an autoreceptor, specifically within the [[striatum]], but also parts of [[basal ganglia]] then will inhibit serotonin release. This disinhibits frontal dopamine release. The local deficit of 5-HT within the striatum, basal ganglia, and [[prefrontal cortex]] causes a deficit of excitatory [[5-HT6]] signalling. This could possibly be the reason antipsychotics sometimes are reported to aggravate negative symptoms as antipsychotics are 5HT6 ''antagonists'' This receptor is primarily GABAergic, as such, it causes an excess of glutamatergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic activity within the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. An excess of [[5-HT7]] signaling within the [[thalamus]] also creates too much excitatory transmission to the prefrontal cortex. Combined with another critical abnormality observed in schizoid patients: [[5-HT2A]] dysfunction, this altered signalling cascade creates cortical, thus cognitive abnormalities. [[5-HT2A]] allows a link between cortical, thus conscious, and the basal ganglia, unconscious. Axons from 5-HT2A neurons in layer V of the [[cerebral cortex]] reach the basal ganglia, forming a feedback loop. Signalling from layer V of the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia alters [[5-HT2C]] signalling. This feedback loop with 5-HT2A/[[5-HT2C]] is how the outer cortex layers can exert some control over our neuropeptides, specifically [[opioid peptides]], [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]]. This alteration in this limbic-layer V axis may create the profound change in social cognition (and sometimes cognition as a whole) that is observed in schizoid patients. However, genesis of the actual alterations is a much more complex phenomena.\n\n==The role of inhibitory transmission==\nThe [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]] is the source of the ordered input necessary for a higher level upper cortical loop. Feedback is controlled by the inhibitory potential of the cortices via the striatum. Through 5-HT2A efferents from layer V of the cortex transmission proceeds through the striatum into the globulus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars compacta. This core input to the basal ganglia is combined with input from the subthalamic nucleus. The only primarily dopaminergic pathway in this loop is a reciprocal connection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata to the striatum.\n\nDopaminergic drugs such as dopamine releasing agents and direct dopamine receptor agonists create alterations in this primarily GABAergic pathway via increased dopaminergic feedback from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. However, dopamine also modulates other cortical areas, namely the VTA; with efferents to the amygdala and locus coeruleus, likely modulating anxiety and paranoid aspects of psychotic experience. As such, the glutamate hypothesis is probably not an explanation of primary causative factors in positive psychosis, but rather might possibly be an explanation for negative symptoms.\n\n[[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] elaborates upon the nature of abnormal lateral structures found in someone with a high risk for psychosis.\n\n==Altered signalling cascades==\nAgain, thalamic input from layer V is a crucial factor in the functionality of the human brain. It allows the two sides to receive similar inputs, thus be able to perceive the same world. In psychosis, thalamic input loses much of its integrated character: hyperactive core feedback loops overwhelm the ordered output. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is due to excessive D2 and 5-HT2A activity. This alteration in input to the top and bottom of the cortex. The altered 5-HT signal cascade enhances the strength of excitatory thalamic input from layer V. This abnormality, enhancing the thalamic-cortical transmission cascade versus the corticostriatal control, creates a feedback loop, resulting in abnormally strong basal ganglia output.{{Dubious|date=December 2018}} \n\nThe root of psychosis (experiences that cannot be explained, even within their own mind) is when basal ganglia input to layer V overwhelms the inhibitory potential of the higher cortexies resulting from striatal transmission. When combined with the excess prefrontal, specifically [[orbitofrontal]] transmission, from the hippocampus, this creates a brain prone to falling into self reinforcing belief.\n\nHowever, given a specific environment, a person with this kind of brain (a human) can create a self-reinforcing pattern of maladaptive behavior, from the altered the layer II/III and III/I axises, from the disinhibited thalamic output. Rationality is impaired, primarily as response to the deficit of oxytocin and excess of vasopressin from the abnormal 5HT2C activity.\n\nFrontal cortex activity will be impaired, when combined with excess DA activity: the basis for the advancement of schizophrenia, but it is also the neurologic mechanism behind many other psychotic diseases as well.. Heredation of schizophrenia may even be a result of conspecific \"refrigerator parenting\" techniques passed on though generations. However, the genetic component is the primary source of the neurological abnormalities which leave one prone to psychological disorders.

GluR1 subunit-containing AMPA receptors are Ca2+ permeable while GluR2/3 subunit-positive receptors are nearly impermeable to calcium ions. In the regulated pathway, GluR1 dimers populate the synapse at a rate proportional to NMDA-ergic Ca2+ influx. In the constitutative pathway, GluR2/3 dimers populate the synapse at a steady state.\n\nThis forms a positive feedback loop, where a small trigger impulse degating NMDA from Mg2+ pore blockade results in calcium influx, this calcium influx then triggers trafficking of GluR1-containing(Ca2+ permeable) subunits to the PSD, such trafficking of GluR1-positive AMPA to the postsynaptic neuron allows for upmodulation of the postsynaptic neuron's calcium influx in response to presynaptic calcium influx. Robust negative feedback at NMDA from kyenurenic acid, magnesium, zinc, and agmatine prevents runaway feedback.\n\nMisregulation of this pathway would sympathetically dysregulate LTP via disruption of NMDA. Such alteration in LTP may play a role, specifically in negative symptoms of schizophrenia, in creation of more broad disruptions such as loss of brain volume; an effect of the disease which antidopaminergics actually worsen, rather than treat.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25802081 |year=2015 |last1=Vita |first1=A |title=The Effect of Antipsychotic Treatment on Cortical Gray Matter Changes in Schizophrenia: Does the Class Matter?

Cigarettes, consumed far out of proportion by schizophrenics, contain nornitrosonicotine; a potent a7 antagonist. This may indicate a7 pentameter excess as a causative factor, or possibly as a method of self-medication to combat antipsychotic side effects. Cannabidiol, a FAAH inhibitor, increases levels in anandamide and may have antipsychotic effect; though results are mixed here as anandamide also is a cannabinoid and as such displays some psychotomimetic effect. However, a7 nicotinic ''agonists'' have been indicated as potential treatments for schizophrenia, though evidence is somewhat contradictory there is indication a7 nAChR is somehow involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.\n\n==The role of 5-HT==\nThis deficit in activation also results in a decrease in activity of 5-HT1A receptors in the [[raphe nucleus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bantick|first=R.

The [[5-HT1B receptor]], also acting as an autoreceptor, specifically within the [[striatum]], but also parts of [[basal ganglia]] then will inhibit serotonin release. This disinhibits frontal dopamine release. The local deficit of 5-HT within the striatum, basal ganglia, and [[prefrontal cortex]] causes a deficit of excitatory [[5-HT6]] signalling. This could possibly be the reason antipsychotics sometimes are reported to aggravate negative symptoms as antipsychotics are 5HT6 ''antagonists'' This receptor is primarily GABAergic, as such, it causes an excess of glutamatergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic activity within the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. An excess of [[5-HT7]] signaling within the [[thalamus]] also creates too much excitatory transmission to the prefrontal cortex. Combined with another critical abnormality observed in schizoid patients: [[5-HT2A]] dysfunction, this altered signalling cascade creates cortical, thus cognitive abnormalities. [[5-HT2A]] allows a link between cortical, thus conscious, and the basal ganglia, unconscious. Axons from 5-HT2A neurons in layer V of the [[cerebral cortex]] reach the basal ganglia, forming a feedback loop. Signalling from layer V of the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia alters [[5-HT2C]] signalling. This feedback loop with 5-HT2A/[[5-HT2C]] is how the outer cortex layers can exert some control over our neuropeptides, specifically [[opioid peptides]], [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]]. This alteration in this limbic-layer V axis may create the profound change in social cognition (and sometimes cognition as a whole) that is observed in schizoid patients. However, genesis of the actual alterations is a much more complex phenomena.\n\n==The role of inhibitory transmission==\nThe [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]] is the source of the ordered input necessary for a higher level upper cortical loop. Feedback is controlled by the inhibitory potential of the cortices via the striatum. Through 5-HT2A efferents from layer V of the cortex transmission proceeds through the striatum into the globulus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars compacta. This core input to the basal ganglia is combined with input from the subthalamic nucleus. The only primarily dopaminergic pathway in this loop is a reciprocal connection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata to the striatum.\n\nDopaminergic drugs such as dopamine releasing agents and direct dopamine receptor agonists create alterations in this primarily GABAergic pathway via increased dopaminergic feedback from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. However, dopamine also modulates other cortical areas, namely the VTA; with efferents to the amygdala and locus coeruleus, likely modulating anxiety and paranoid aspects of psychotic experience. As such, the glutamate hypothesis is probably not an explanation of primary causative factors in positive psychosis, but rather might possibly be an explanation for negative symptoms.\n\n[[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] elaborates upon the nature of abnormal lateral structures found in someone with a high risk for psychosis.\n\n==Altered signalling cascades==\nAgain, thalamic input from layer V is a crucial factor in the functionality of the human brain. It allows the two sides to receive similar inputs, thus be able to perceive the same world. In psychosis, thalamic input loses much of its integrated character: hyperactive core feedback loops overwhelm the ordered output. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is due to excessive D2 and 5-HT2A activity. This alteration in input to the top and bottom of the cortex. The altered 5-HT signal cascade enhances the strength of excitatory thalamic input from layer V. This abnormality, enhancing the thalamic-cortical transmission cascade versus the corticostriatal control, creates a feedback loop, resulting in abnormally strong basal ganglia output.{{Dubious|date=December 2018}} \n\nThe root of psychosis (experiences that cannot be explained, even within their own mind) is when basal ganglia input to layer V overwhelms the inhibitory potential of the higher cortexies resulting from striatal transmission. When combined with the excess prefrontal, specifically [[orbitofrontal]] transmission, from the hippocampus, this creates a brain prone to falling into self reinforcing belief.\n\nHowever, given a specific environment, a person with this kind of brain (a human) can create a self-reinforcing pattern of maladaptive behavior, from the altered the layer II/III and III/I axises, from the disinhibited thalamic output. Rationality is impaired, primarily as response to the deficit of oxytocin and excess of vasopressin from the abnormal 5HT2C activity.\n\nFrontal cortex activity will be impaired, when combined with excess DA activity: the basis for the advancement of schizophrenia, but it is also the neurologic mechanism behind many other psychotic diseases as well.. Heredation of schizophrenia may even be a result of conspecific \"refrigerator parenting\" techniques passed on though generations. However, the genetic component is the primary source of the neurological abnormalities which leave one prone to psychological disorders. Specifically, there is much overlap between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.\n\nPsychotic disorder is linked to excessive drug use, specifically [[dissociative]]s, [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[stimulant]]s, and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].\n\n==Current state of schizophrenia treatment==\nAlterations in serine racemase indicate that the endogenous NDMA ''agonist'' D-serine <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Labrie|first=Viviane|last2=Fukumura|first2=Ryutaro|last3=Rastogi|first3=Anjali|last4=Fick|first4=Laura J.|last5=Wang|first5=Wei|last6=Boutros|first6=Paul C.|last7=Kennedy|first7=James L.|last8=Semeralul|first8=Mawahib O.|last9=Lee|first9=Frankie H.|date=2009-09-01|title=Serine racemase is associated with schizophrenia susceptibility in humans and in a mouse model|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=18|issue=17|pages=3227\u20133243|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp261|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2722985|pmid=19483194}}</ref>may be produced abnormally in schizophrenia and that d-serine may be an effective treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nSchizophrenia is now treated by medications known as [[antipsychotics]] (or [[neuroleptics]]) that typically reduce dopaminergic activity because too much activity has been most strongly linked to [[positive symptoms]], specifically persecutory delusions.
