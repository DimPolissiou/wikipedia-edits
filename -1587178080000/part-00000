However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award). She then released \"[[She Wants You#Billie version|She Wants You]]\" as the third single from the album. The song reached number three. \"Honey to the Bee\" was released as the fourth single from the album; like the previous single, it reached number three. <!--note: the album is ''Honey to the B'', but the song is \"Honey to the Bee.\"-->At the same time, \"She Wants You\" was released in the US, reaching number  9 on the \"Hot Club Dance Play\" chart.\n\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two [[BRIT Awards]] and won two awards at the 1999 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, although she was reduced to tears at the latter ceremony after being booed by fans of [[Ritchie Neville]], whom she was dating at the time. She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined. She recorded a song for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'' titled \"[[Billie Piper discography#Other appearances|Makin' My Way (Any Way That I Can)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pokemon-the-first-movie-mw0000254801|title= Pokemon: The First Movie > Overview|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n====''Walk of Life''====\n[[File:Billie Piper (16) edited.jpg|thumb|Piper in 2004]]\nDuring that time, Piper recorded her second album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number-one single \"[[Day & Night (song)|Day & Night]]\". She waited until September to release \"[[Something Deep Inside]]\", which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, ''[[Walk of Life (album)|Walk of Life]]'', which reached #14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached #17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at #23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a \"commercial bomb\". The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1321339/Billie-Piper-needs-head-cut-off-said-telephone-threats.html |title=Billie Piper 'needs head cut off', said telephone threats |date=6 February 2001 |last=Demetriou |first=Danielle |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence. According to her autobiography, Piper was reluctant about the court case, but was pushed by her parents and her label. She also stated in the book that this was why \"The Tide Is High\" was not released as a single, writing: \"The court case succeeded in doing what I alone could not {{ndash}} cutting the ties.

The college was inaugurated in 1930 after the British Government had received a bequest from the [[Iraq]]i-born [[Jews|Jewish]] [[philanthropist]] [[Sir Ellis Kadoorie]].<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> The college was named in his honour and still bears his name. \n'''\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and British Mandate years===\n[[File:Kadoorie Tulkarm.jpg|thumbnail|The agricultural school in the 1930s]]\n\nKadoorie is one of two of agricultural schools founded as agricultural schools by the British during the [[Mandatory Palestine]] period with contributions from a bequest of the [[Iraq]]i-born [[Jews|Jewish]] [[philanthropist]] [[Sir Ellis Kadoorie]], who died in the British colony of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] in 1922. Kadoorie contributed 1,000,000 British Pounds. However, when Kadoorie's testament was read it became clear that the [[Yishuv]] would not inherit the money - the government of Britain would - and that Kadoorie ordered in his testament to invest the money either in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or in [[Iraq]]. Initially an agricultural school was built in Tulkarm.<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> This opened in 1930 with an English principal; the school had the character of a British colonial institution.<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> Soon after many institutions and leaders of the Yishuv made a petition to [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] for the establishment of a Jewish school.<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> The British authorities endorsed the idea of a [[Palestinian Jews|Palestinian Jewish]] agricultural school similar to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] school in Tulkarm.<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> The foundations for the second school were laid down in 1931 at Um J\u2019abal, next to the village of [[Kfar Tavor]] and the Jewish [[Kadoorie Agricultural High School]] was opened in 1933.<ref name=\"ASYA\">Shapira, Anita (2008) Yigal Allon, Native Son; a Biography translated by Evelyn Able, University of Pennsylvania press. {{ISBN|0-8122-4028-6}} pp 35-36</ref> Both school buildings were designed by British architect [[Austen Harrison]], chief architect of the Public Works Department of British Mandatory Palestine's government.\n\nThe Agricultural college in Tulkarm came under the authority of the Government of the British Mandate and was supervised by the Department of Agriculture.<ref name=\"ASYA\"/> In addition to the agricultural land the college included cattle, sheep and chicken farms. The agricultural school played an important role in providing the Palestinian agricultural sector with technicians in various fields of agriculture.
