The archaeological site herein designated by the name of EI Inga was brought to the attention of Bell by Allen Graffham.

The prehistoric village covered over 26 hectares in an area irrigated by many creeks. Near the rectangular there are also burials with pottery and stone offerings. The Cotocollao people extracted and exported obsidian to the coastal region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/|title=The Cambridge Prehistory of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela|last=Lleras|first=Roberto|publisher=Eclass|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:Virgen Gu\u00e1pulo.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork that shows a far view of the city.

In 1563, Quito became the seat of a ''Real Audiencia'' (administrative district) of Spain and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], until 1717 after the ''Audiencia'' was part of a newly created [[Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada]]. Its administration on both Viceroyalties remained to Quito. (see [[Real Audiencia de Quito]])\n\n[[File:Plano de la Ciudad de Quito hacia 1805.

In January 1535, the San Francisco Convent was constructed, the first of about 20 churches and convents built during the colonial period. The Spanish converted the indigenous population to Christianity and used them as labor for construction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn 1743, after nearly 210 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} On August 10, 1809, an independence movement from Spanish domination started in Quito. On that date, a plan for government was established that placed Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar as president with various other prominent figures in other positions of government. However, this initial movement was ultimately defeated on August 2, 1810, when colonial troops came from [[Lima]], [[Peru]], killing the leaders of the uprising along with about 200 settlers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} A chain of conflicts concluded on May 24, 1822, when [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], under the command of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], led troops into the [[Battle of Pichincha]]. Their victory marked the independence of Quito and the surrounding areas.\n\n===Republican Ecuador===\nIn 1833, members of the Society of Free Inhabitants of Quito were assassinated by the government after they conspired against it, and on March 6, 1845, the [[Marcist Revolution]] began. Later, in 1875, the country's president, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]], was assassinated in Quito. Two years later, in 1877, Archbishop [[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Checa y Barba]] was killed by poisoning while he was celebrating Mass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 1882, insurgents arose against the regime of dictator [[Ignacio de Veintimilla]]. However, this did not end the violence that was occurring throughout the country. On July 9, 1883, the liberal commander [[Eloy Alfaro]] participated in the [[Battle of Guayaquil]], and later, after more conflict, became the president of Ecuador on September 4, 1895. Upon completing his second term in 1911, he moved to [[Europe]]. When he returned to Ecuador in 1912 and attempted a return to power, he was arrested on January 28, 1912; thrown in prison; and assassinated by a [[Gang|mob]] that had stormed the prison. His body was dragged through the streets of Quito to a city park, where it was burned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 1932, the [[Four Days' War]] broke out. This was a civil war that followed the election of [[Neptal\u00ed Bonifaz]] and the subsequent realization that he carried a Peruvian passport. On February 12, 1949, a realistic broadcast of [[H. G.

Parishes are called ''urban'' if they are within the boundaries of the seat (capital) of their corresponding canton, and ''rural'' if outside those boundaries. Inside Quito (the city proper), subdivision into urban parishes depends on the organizations that use these parishes (e.g., the municipality, the electoral tribunals, the postal service, the Ecuadorian statistics institute). The urban parishes of different types are not necessarily coterminous nor the same in number or name.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, the municipality of Quito divided the city into 32 urban parishes. These parishes, which are used by the municipality for administrative purposes, are also known as ''cabildos''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.quito.gob.ec/spirales/8_diccionario_de_la_base_de_datos/8_1_fondo_cartografico/8_1_1_1.html |title=Diccionario.

This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mud\u00e9jar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery. In the museum located on the north side of the lower cloister are wonderful pieces of great Quito sculptors such as the [[Saint Dominic|Saint Dominic de Guzm\u00e1n]] by Father Carlos, the [[John of God|Saint John of God]] by Caspicara, and the [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] by Legarda. Another Baroque piece that stands is the Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, which is a recognizable feature of the architecture of Quito. This chapel was built beside the church, in the gospel side. In this was founded the largest fraternity in the city of Quito.\n<gallery>\nFile:Carondelet - Quito.JPG|[[Carondelet Palace]], office and house of the Presidents of Ecuador.\nFile:Catedral metropolitana Quito.jpg|[[Cathedral of Quito]].\nFile:Iglesia de La Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 149-151 HDR.JPG|Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas.\nFile:Bas\u00edlica del Voto Nacional - Quito.jpg|[[Bas\u00edlica del Voto Nacional]].\nFile:Iglesia de San Francisco, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 152.JPG|[[Church and Convent of St. Francis|Church of San Francisco]].\nIglesia de San Francisco, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 171-173 HDR.JPG|Interior of the church of San Francisco.\nFile:Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Quito - 2.jpg|View of the Church of Santo Domingo.\nIglesia de Santo Domingo, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 196.JPG|Interior of the church of Santo Domingo.\nIglesia de Santo Domingo, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 202-204 HDR.JPG|Chapel of the Rosary within the church of Santo Domingo.\nPalacio Gangotena, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 156.JPG|Gangotena Palace.\nPalacio Municipal, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 189.JPG|Municipal Palace in the Plaza Grande.\nPlaza Grande, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 81-85 PAN.JPG|Plaza Grande.\nCentro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Quito pic b4.JPG|Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Quito.\nAntiguo Hospital Militar (Centro Hist\u00f3rico, Quito) pic a05.JPG|Antiguo Hospital Militar (Centro Hist\u00f3rico, Quito).\nFile:Quito, Ecuador - Michael Shade.jpeg|View of Quito from Bas\u00edlica del Voto Nacional\nFile:Virgen de Quito Panecillo 03.jpg|Virgin of [[El Panecillo]]\nFile:Cementerio de San Diego, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 59.JPG|Cemetery of San Diego, Quito\n</gallery>\n\n===El Panecillo===\n[[File:Vista de Quito desde El Panecillo, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 34-37 PAN.JPG|thumbnail|View of Quito from El Panecillo.]]\n[[El Panecillo]] is a hill located in the middle west of the city at an altitude of about {{convert|3016|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].

In 1563, Quito became the seat of a ''Real Audiencia'' (administrative district) of Spain and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], until 1717 after the ''Audiencia'' was part of a newly created [[Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada]].

In January 1535, the San Francisco Convent was constructed, the first of about 20 churches and convents built during the colonial period. The Spanish converted the indigenous population to Christianity and used them as labor for construction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn 1743, after nearly 210 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} On August 10, 1809, an independence movement from Spanish domination started in Quito. On that date, a plan for government was established that placed Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar as president with various other prominent figures in other positions of government. However, this initial movement was ultimately defeated on August 2, 1810, when colonial troops came from [[Lima]], [[Peru]], killing the leaders of the uprising along with about 200 settlers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} A chain of conflicts concluded on May 24, 1822, when [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], under the command of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], led troops into the [[Battle of Pichincha]]. Their victory marked the independence of Quito and the surrounding areas.\n\n===Republican Ecuador===\nIn 1833, members of the Society of Free Inhabitants of Quito were assassinated by the government after they conspired against it, and on March 6, 1845, the [[Marcist Revolution]] began. Later, in 1875, the country's president, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]], was assassinated in Quito. Two years later, in 1877, Archbishop [[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Checa y Barba]] was killed by poisoning while he was celebrating Mass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 1882, insurgents arose against the regime of dictator [[Ignacio de Veintimilla]]. However, this did not end the violence that was occurring throughout the country. On July 9, 1883, the liberal commander [[Eloy Alfaro]] participated in the [[Battle of Guayaquil]], and later, after more conflict, became the president of Ecuador on September 4, 1895. Upon completing his second term in 1911, he moved to [[Europe]]. When he returned to Ecuador in 1912 and attempted a return to power, he was arrested on January 28, 1912; thrown in prison; and assassinated by a [[Gang|mob]] that had stormed the prison. His body was dragged through the streets of Quito to a city park, where it was burned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 1932, the [[Four Days' War]] broke out. This was a civil war that followed the election of [[Neptal\u00ed Bonifaz]] and the subsequent realization that he carried a Peruvian passport. On February 12, 1949, a realistic broadcast of [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' led to citywide panic and the deaths of more than twenty people who died in fires set by mobs.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Brown |title=Manipulating the Ether |pages=251\u2013252 |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=0-7864-2066-9 }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2011, the city's population was 2,239,191 people.

Parishes are called ''urban'' if they are within the boundaries of the seat (capital) of their corresponding canton, and ''rural'' if outside those boundaries. Inside Quito (the city proper), subdivision into urban parishes depends on the organizations that use these parishes (e.g., the municipality, the electoral tribunals, the postal service, the Ecuadorian statistics institute). The urban parishes of different types are not necessarily coterminous nor the same in number or name.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, the municipality of Quito divided the city into 32 urban parishes.

There is a Jewish school in Quito, the Colegio Experimental Alberto Einstein, established in 1973, which serves both Jewish and non-Jewish students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. All Jewish holidays are celebrated by the school, and Hebrew and other Jewish studies are taught there. The school has a fair reputation and pre-college preparatory program.

During the Republican era, almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which the President and his family dwell.

The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mud\u00e9jar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery. In the museum located on the north side of the lower cloister are wonderful pieces of great Quito sculptors such as the [[Saint Dominic|Saint Dominic de Guzm\u00e1n]] by Father Carlos, the [[John of God|Saint John of God]] by Caspicara, and the [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] by Legarda. Another Baroque piece that stands is the Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, which is a recognizable feature of the architecture of Quito. This chapel was built beside the church, in the gospel side.

Because of the increased elevation and the wind on the mountain, it is considerably cooler.\n\nBesides the aerial tramway to Cruz Loma, the [[Telef\u00e9riqo]] as a whole is a visitor centre that includes an amusement park ([[Vulqano Park]]), fine-dining restaurants, Go Karts, Paint Ball, shopping malls, an extensive food court, and other attractions.\n\n===Outside the city===\n[[File:Mitad del Mundo, Ecuador 5.jpg|upright|thumb|The monument at the equator (La Mitad del Mundo)]]\nLa [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo|Mitad del Mundo]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mitaddelmundo.com/indexeng.html |title=Welcome to Mitad del Mundo |website=GoEcuador.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204145137/http://www.mitaddelmundo.com/indexeng.html |archive-date=December 4, 2004 }}</ref> (the middle of the world) is a small village administered by the prefecture of the province of Pichincha, {{convert|35|km}} north of Quito.

For example, the acid may be [[acetic acid]] and the salt may be [[sodium acetate]].\nThe Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation relates the [[pH]] of a solution containing a mixture of the two components to the [[acid dissociation constant]], K<sub>a</sub>, and the concentrations of the species in solution.<ref>For details and worked examples see, for instance, {{cite book |last1=Skoog |first1=Douglas A. |last2=West |first2=Donald M. |last3=Holler |first3=F.

Notable producer, and former [[Digable Planets]] member, [[King Britt]], described the song as \"what [[Curtis Mayfield]] would be doing today!\"<ref name=\"profile.myspace.com\"/> ''Spaceshift'' was also popular among mainstream critics, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine noting that Spacek \"...gives new meaning to the phrase space funk\",<ref name=\"profile.myspace.com\"/> and [[The Fader|Fader magazine]] calling the group \"the most futuristic soul group of our modern age\".<ref name=\"profile.myspace.com\"/>\n\nThe group, fronted by White, continues to tour and gig all over the world. Its members now live in [[Los Angeles]], [[Munich, Germany|Munich]], and [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]].

The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009.

The conference drew 109 heads of state to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/earthsummit/ |title=United Nations Earth Summit+5 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 June 1997 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. \"The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html/ |title=Earth_Summit |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nMajor outcomes of the conference include the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) \u2014a climate-change agreement that led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Agenda 21]], the [[United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD).

At Rio+10, [[sustainable development]] was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national, regional and international levels. There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system.<ref name=\"isfd.html\"/>\n\nMajor outcomes of that conference include the [[Johannesburg Declaration]] and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].\n\n== Objectives ==\n[[File:Rio+20 statue of liberty and Dilma Rousseff.JPG|thumb|Demonstration at Rio+20.

The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document.\n\nRio+20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein, and discussing new and emerging issues.\n<ref name=\"Gerhardt\">{{Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=20 June 2012|title=Rio+20 Kicks Off|url=http://www.progressive.org/rio_20_kicks_off.html|work=[[The Progressive]]}}</ref> The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN \"green economy roadmap\", with environmental goals, targets and deadlines, whereas developing countries preferred establishing new \"sustainable development goals\" to better protect the environment, guarantee food and power to the poorest, and alleviate poverty.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/19/rio-20-earth-summit-1992-2012 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=Rio+20: Earth summit dawns with stormier clouds than in 1992 | date=19 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nRio+20 attracted many protests, and more than 500 parallel events, exhibitions, presentations, fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention.

Numbered in the thousands, these activists joined forces to stand up to what they considered exploitation and degradation of the [[Earth]], as well as the negation of the rights of [[indigenous peoples]]. This group is ever more relevant in [[Brazil]] as [[deforestation]] threatens [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] ethnic groups everyday.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Scott |title=Last of the Amazon|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/last-of-amazon/ |work=National Geographic |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to holding signs and shouting chants, the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages. Firstly, they poked at [[Brazilian President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]], claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/megastars-of-the-earth-summit/|title=Stars of the Earth Summit|first=Taylor|last=Barnes|date=4 August 1692|website=Green Blog}}</ref>  Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic \"tearing up\" of the plenary's negotiated text,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Watts, in Rio de Janeiro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/21/rio-20-protesters-text-agreement |title=The Guardian June 21, 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> conveying their disapproval.\n\nThousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Gerhardt\"/> Organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist [[Jens Galschi\u00f8t]], the leader of the group [[AIDOH]], and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during [[Rio+20]] and a related television program was produced in [[Denmark]].\n\n===Ahmadinejad Visit to Rio===\nThere was some controversy over Iran's involvement in the Rio+20 conference.

In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\n\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Summit]]\n** [[Agenda 21]]\n** [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]\n* [[Durban III]] The conference opened on 22 September 2011\n* [[Planetary boundaries#United Nations endorsement|Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n* [[The United Nations Ocean Conference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420002837/http://www.uncsd2012.org/ United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]\n* [[Brundtland Report|Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development]]\n** [http://rio20.ebc.com.br/memoria/ Videos, photos and information about the Summit in Brazil]\n** [http://rio20.net/en/ Rio+20 Portal.

The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009.

The conference drew 109 heads of state to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/earthsummit/ |title=United Nations Earth Summit+5 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 June 1997 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. \"The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html/ |title=Earth_Summit |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nMajor outcomes of the conference include the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) \u2014a climate-change agreement that led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Agenda 21]], the [[United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD). It also created new international institutions, among them the Commission on Sustainable Development, tasked with the follow-up to the Rio Conference and led to the reform of the [[Global Environment Facility]].<ref name=\"isfd.html\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/isfd.html |title=Rio+20 \u2013 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nTen years later, [[Earth Summit 2002]] informally nicknamed Rio+10 was held in Johannesburg, South Africa with the goal of again bringing together leaders from government, business and NGOs to agree on a range of measures toward similar goals. At Rio+10, [[sustainable development]] was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national, regional and international levels. There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system.<ref name=\"isfd.html\"/>\n\nMajor outcomes of that conference include the [[Johannesburg Declaration]] and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].\n\n== Objectives ==\n[[File:Rio+20 statue of liberty and Dilma Rousseff.JPG|thumb|Demonstration at Rio+20.

That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years.

In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects.
