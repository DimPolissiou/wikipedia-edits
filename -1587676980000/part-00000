(It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded.

(It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W.

Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

It is a center of recreation and tourism and of various cultural events (e.g. the Summer Festival of Music). The spa provides treatment of [[rheumatism]] and post-traumatic disorders.\n\n==History==\nIn the middle of the 13th century as ''terra Teplicza'' it was property of the [[House of Cseszneky|Cseszneky de Milv\u00e1ny]] family.<ref>Monumenta Hungariae historica</ref> It has been a spa site since the 14th century. As early as the 16th century, the spa was known all over Europe, and was mentioned as the most important of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The spa was owned by the [[Ill\u00e9sh\u00e1zy]], an aristocratic family of the Kingdom of Hungary, from 1582 onwards. In 1835, it was bought by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] financier [[Jozef Sina]], who developed the area. The spa was [[nationalised]] after the Second World War.\n\nA [[hydroelectric]] power station (it was producing polyphase AC of 5250 V) was built between 1886\u20131888 and supplied the town's streetlights as well as surrounding communities ([[Tren\u010dianska Tepl\u00e1]], [[Ko\u0161eca]], [[Ladce]]) with electricity.

{{lang-hu|Trencs\u00e9nteplic|links=no}}) is a health resort and small [[spa town]] in western [[Slovakia]], in the valley of the river [[Tepli\u010dka (river)|Tepli\u010dka]], at the foothills of the [[Str\u00e1\u017eovsk\u00e9 vrchy]] mountains.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe town is renowned for its sulphuric and [[hot spring|thermal spring]]s. It is a center of recreation and tourism and of various cultural events (e.g. the Summer Festival of Music). The spa provides treatment of [[rheumatism]] and post-traumatic disorders.\n\n==History==\nIn the middle of the 13th century as ''terra Teplicza'' it was property of the [[House of Cseszneky|Cseszneky de Milv\u00e1ny]] family.<ref>Monumenta Hungariae historica</ref> It has been a spa site since the 14th century. As early as the 16th century, the spa was known all over Europe, and was mentioned as the most important of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The spa was owned by the [[Ill\u00e9sh\u00e1zy]], an aristocratic family of the Kingdom of Hungary, from 1582 onwards. In 1835, it was bought by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] financier [[Jozef Sina]], who developed the area. The spa was [[nationalised]] after the Second World War.\n\nA [[hydroelectric]] power station (it was producing polyphase AC of 5250 V) was built between 1886\u20131888 and supplied the town's streetlights as well as surrounding communities ([[Tren\u010dianska Tepl\u00e1]], [[Ko\u0161eca]], [[Ladce]]) with electricity. It also powered a special narrow-gauged public electric railway opened on 29 July 1909.

As an ABC affiliate, WMAR-TV now usually runs the network's entire lineup. The station was Baltimore's home to ''The [[Jerry Lewis]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' for nearly three decades until it moved to [[WNUV-TV]] (channel 54); in 2013, the telethon moved back to WMAR-TV, airing on ABC as the ''MDA Show of Strength'', for its final two years of its run.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WMAR-TV preempted an hour of the network's weekday morning daytime schedule, as well as CBS' [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]]. However, this was not a problem for Baltimore area viewers, as most of the area got a decent signal from WTOP-TV in Washington (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]). From 1961 until 1980, the station was also co-owned with fellow CBS affiliate [[WBOC-TV]] in [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]].\n\nChannel 2 continued to preempt network programming as an NBC affiliate. ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' was not carried by WMAR-TV for several years in the mid-1980s as the station chose to air ''[[Thicke of the Night]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Bedell Smith |first=Sally |title=Is it time for a fourth TV network? |work=The New York Times |date=August 28, 1983 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/arts/is-it-time-for-a-fourth-tv-network.html }}</ref> and later syndicated [[sitcom]] reruns following the 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. Some of the network's [[NBC Daytime|daytime programming]] was preempted as well. Both ''Tonight'' and preempted daytime programs were aired on then-independent stations WBFF and WNUV, though Baltimore viewers could also watch the entire NBC lineup on [[owned-and-operated station|network-owned]] [[WRC-TV]] in Washington, along with affiliate [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] from [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], whose signal was viewable in areas north of Baltimore County.\n\nUntil September 17, 2012 (upon the institution by Scripps of a company-wide effort at lower-cost original programming), ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' aired on channel 2 from the beginning of their runs in 1984 and 1983 respectively. The two shows immediately moved to Fox affiliate WBFF, where they remain.\n\n===Sports programming===\nFrom [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|1979]] to [[1993 Baltimore Orioles season|1993]], channel 2 was the over-the-air flagship station of the Baltimore Orioles\u2014long after most \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" stations dropped local regular season sports coverage. In addition to Orioles games broadcast in-house by channel 2, WMAR-TV also aired all Orioles games via NBC's MLB broadcast contract from 1982 to 1989. Channel 2 served as the then-Baltimore Colts' station of record (through NBC's AFC broadcast contract) for three seasons from 1981 to 1983, before the team's controversial move to Indianapolis. As a CBS station, WMAR-TV first aired Colts games in 1956, when CBS obtained the broadcast rights to the pre-merger NFL; all Colts games were broadcast exclusively on channel 2 until 1969. From 1970 to 1980, with the Colts' move to the American Football Conference upon the completion of the AFL/NFL merger, WMAR then broadcast all Colts games in which they played host to an NFC team (when CBS assumed the broadcast contract to the post-merger NFC).\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:WMAR WeatherNet Digital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|WMAR Comcast WeatherNet Digital screenshot.]]\n[[File:Wmar tv live shot.jpg|thumb|right|185px|WMAR-TV anchors Kelly Swoope and Jamie Costello prepare for live shot in downtown Baltimore, April 27, 2011.]]\nWMAR-TV presently broadcasts 23\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour on Sundays); with regards to the amount of news programming, it is the lowest output among Baltimore's television stations. Unlike most news-producing ABC affiliates that are located in the Eastern Time Zone, WMAR does not air a newscast in the weekday midday timeslot; it also holds the distinction of being the largest news-producing \"Big Three\" station by market size that does not air any local newscasts on Saturdays (although WMAR does produce local weather cut-ins that are shown during the weekend edition of ''[[Good Morning America]]'').\n\nWMAR is also one of ten television stations that airs the \"Don't Waste Your Money\" series of consumer reports from John Matarese, based at Cincinnati sister station [[WCPO-TV]]. WMAR formerly operated a 24-hour local weather channel known as \"ABC 2 WeatherNet Digital\", which was also available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] [[digital cable]] channel 204 and streamed on the station's website; until 2012, the channel was also broadcast on a third [[digital subchannel]] of WMAR's over-the-air signal.\n\nDespite its newspaper roots and its status as the oldest television station in Maryland, WMAR's newscasts have been in last place among Baltimore's \"Big Three\" network affiliates since the early 1960s, and the station has not been a significant factor in the news ratings in over 30 years. This was the case even during the 1980s, with NBC's powerhouse primetime lineup as a lead-in.\n\nCurrently, WMAR's newscasts lag behind both WBAL-TV and WJZ-TV in the ratings by a wide margin, and has even trailed WBFF in some timeslots. For the past decade, WMAR and WBFF have formed one tier of local newscast ratings\u2014significantly lower than the tier that is occupied by WBAL and WJZ. As such, it is currently one of ABC's weakest affiliates, especially in a top-50 market. By contrast, WJZ-TV dominated the ratings in the Baltimore market when it was affiliated with ABC before it switched to CBS.\n\nHowever, WMAR formerly boasted one of the most respected sports departments in the region, thanks in large part to the presence of longtime anchor and former [[Baltimore Ravens]] radio play-by-play announcer Scott Garceau. Garceau has since left to host a show on [[WJZ-FM]] and sports director Rob Carlin left for [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], meaning WMAR's newscasts no longer have a separate sports anchor. Despite this, the station lays claim to the market's most aggressive coverage of local college and high school [[lacrosse]], arguably the most popular sport in the area among young athletes. WMAR works in partnership with [[ESPNU]] to produce the ''ABC 2 Lacrosse Game of the Week'' during the college season, featuring prime matchups involving one or more Maryland lacrosse powerhouses, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Loyola College in Maryland]], [[Towson University]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. Garceau continues to do play-by-play for the station's lacrosse telecasts. [[Quint Kessenich]], four-time lacrosse All-American with Johns Hopkins, is a major contributor to lacrosse coverage and appears sporadically as a fill-in anchor, host of the station's [[Baltimore Blast]] show and field reporter for select Ravens games.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, WMAR-TV became the last station in the market and the last Scripps-owned television station at the time to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]] (Scripps has since acquired the television station group of [[McGraw-Hill]]; of those stations, one of them still produces its newscasts in [[pillarbox]]ed [[4:3]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] as of January 2012). On April 18, 2011, WMAR became the first television station in Baltimore to expand its weekday morning newscast to the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2011-04-wmar_channel_goes_to_430_am_ne-story.html|title=WMAR Channel 2 Goes to 4:30am Newscast|last=Zurawik|first=David|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=18 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Curt Anderson]] \u2013 news reporter (a graduate of local \"[[Magnet school|magnet\"]] academic premier public high school - [[Baltimore City College]], currently in the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] in lower chamber of [[Maryland House of Delegates|House of Delegates]])<ref>http://www.delegatecurtanderson.com</ref>\n* [[Andy Barth]] \u2013 left WMAR to pursue a political career, his 2006 bid for U.S. Congress failed; now reporter for [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[Nelson Benton]] (1982\u20131983) former ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' correspondent (died February 13, 1988)\n* [[Keith Cate]] (now at [[WFLA-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg, Florida]])\n* [[Stu Kerr]] (1928\u20131994) \u2013 At station 1952\u20131981, longtime \"public face\" of the station, \"jack-of-all-trades\" from various hosts of early morning children's shows \u2013 a janitor on ''The Early Riser'', and comic roles as \"Professor Kool\" and \"[[Bozo the Clown]]\" to \"Mr. Fortune\" on ''Dialing for Dollars'' and weather forecaster.\n* [[Tom Marr]] \u2013 morning news anchor and news director for WFBR Radio AM 1300; sportscaster for CBS Radio; former [[Baltimore Orioles]] radio broadcaster; Longtime talk show host on conservative talk radio AM 680 [[WCBM]] in Baltimore, died in 2016)\n* [[Jim McKay]] \u2013 did early first broadcasts in late 1940s, (went on to host [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (American TV program)|Wide World of Sports]]'', died in 2008)\n* [[Uma Pemmaraju]] (now an anchor with [[Fox News Channel]])\n* [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]] (went on to [[ESPN]], died in 2016)\n* [[Sally Thorner]] (went on to anchor at competitor [[WJZ-TV]] channel 13, now retired)\n* [[Brian Wood (journalist)|Brian Wood]] (now at [[KATU]] in [[Portland, Oregon]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050319102326/http://www.scripps.com/corporateoverview/businesses/broadcast/wmar.shtml at Scripps.com])\n*{{TVQ|WMAR-TV}}\n*[https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3Aublangsdale%20AND%20subject%3A%22WMAR-TV%20%28Television%20Station%3A%20Baltimore%2C%20Md.%29%22 View archival footage held by the University of Baltimore]\n\n{{Baltimore TV}}\n{{Washington TV}}\n{{Susquehanna Valley TV}}\n{{ABC Maryland}}\n{{EWS CORP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wmar-Tv}}\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Maryland]]\n[[Category:ABC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Bounce TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates]]\n[[Category:E.

Indeed, ABC's ratings in Baltimore went into a steep decline after the switch, with a number of programs falling from first to third in the Baltimore ratings in one stroke.\n\nIn 1996, a year after the affiliation change, station management opted not to renew channel 2's carriage of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', deciding instead to take a chance on the new ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''. The move proved costly in the long term, as market leader WBAL-TV picked up ''Oprah'' until its 2011 end, and ''Rosie'' (which moved to WJZ-TV in late 2000) lasted only seven years.

As an ABC affiliate, WMAR-TV now usually runs the network's entire lineup. The station was Baltimore's home to ''The [[Jerry Lewis]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' for nearly three decades until it moved to [[WNUV-TV]] (channel 54); in 2013, the telethon moved back to WMAR-TV, airing on ABC as the ''MDA Show of Strength'', for its final two years of its run.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WMAR-TV preempted an hour of the network's weekday morning daytime schedule, as well as CBS' [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]].

Some of the network's [[NBC Daytime|daytime programming]] was preempted as well. Both ''Tonight'' and preempted daytime programs were aired on then-independent stations WBFF and WNUV, though Baltimore viewers could also watch the entire NBC lineup on [[owned-and-operated station|network-owned]] [[WRC-TV]] in Washington, along with affiliate [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] from [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], whose signal was viewable in areas north of Baltimore County.\n\nUntil September 17, 2012 (upon the institution by Scripps of a company-wide effort at lower-cost original programming), ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' aired on channel 2 from the beginning of their runs in 1984 and 1983 respectively. The two shows immediately moved to Fox affiliate WBFF, where they remain.\n\n===Sports programming===\nFrom [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|1979]] to [[1993 Baltimore Orioles season|1993]], channel 2 was the over-the-air flagship station of the Baltimore Orioles\u2014long after most \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" stations dropped local regular season sports coverage. In addition to Orioles games broadcast in-house by channel 2, WMAR-TV also aired all Orioles games via NBC's MLB broadcast contract from 1982 to 1989. Channel 2 served as the then-Baltimore Colts' station of record (through NBC's AFC broadcast contract) for three seasons from 1981 to 1983, before the team's controversial move to Indianapolis. As a CBS station, WMAR-TV first aired Colts games in 1956, when CBS obtained the broadcast rights to the pre-merger NFL; all Colts games were broadcast exclusively on channel 2 until 1969. From 1970 to 1980, with the Colts' move to the American Football Conference upon the completion of the AFL/NFL merger, WMAR then broadcast all Colts games in which they played host to an NFC team (when CBS assumed the broadcast contract to the post-merger NFC).\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:WMAR WeatherNet Digital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|WMAR Comcast WeatherNet Digital screenshot.]]\n[[File:Wmar tv live shot.jpg|thumb|right|185px|WMAR-TV anchors Kelly Swoope and Jamie Costello prepare for live shot in downtown Baltimore, April 27, 2011.]]\nWMAR-TV presently broadcasts 23\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour on Sundays); with regards to the amount of news programming, it is the lowest output among Baltimore's television stations. Unlike most news-producing ABC affiliates that are located in the Eastern Time Zone, WMAR does not air a newscast in the weekday midday timeslot; it also holds the distinction of being the largest news-producing \"Big Three\" station by market size that does not air any local newscasts on Saturdays (although WMAR does produce local weather cut-ins that are shown during the weekend edition of ''[[Good Morning America]]'').\n\nWMAR is also one of ten television stations that airs the \"Don't Waste Your Money\" series of consumer reports from John Matarese, based at Cincinnati sister station [[WCPO-TV]]. WMAR formerly operated a 24-hour local weather channel known as \"ABC 2 WeatherNet Digital\", which was also available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] [[digital cable]] channel 204 and streamed on the station's website; until 2012, the channel was also broadcast on a third [[digital subchannel]] of WMAR's over-the-air signal.\n\nDespite its newspaper roots and its status as the oldest television station in Maryland, WMAR's newscasts have been in last place among Baltimore's \"Big Three\" network affiliates since the early 1960s, and the station has not been a significant factor in the news ratings in over 30 years. This was the case even during the 1980s, with NBC's powerhouse primetime lineup as a lead-in.\n\nCurrently, WMAR's newscasts lag behind both WBAL-TV and WJZ-TV in the ratings by a wide margin, and has even trailed WBFF in some timeslots. For the past decade, WMAR and WBFF have formed one tier of local newscast ratings\u2014significantly lower than the tier that is occupied by WBAL and WJZ. As such, it is currently one of ABC's weakest affiliates, especially in a top-50 market. By contrast, WJZ-TV dominated the ratings in the Baltimore market when it was affiliated with ABC before it switched to CBS.\n\nHowever, WMAR formerly boasted one of the most respected sports departments in the region, thanks in large part to the presence of longtime anchor and former [[Baltimore Ravens]] radio play-by-play announcer Scott Garceau. Garceau has since left to host a show on [[WJZ-FM]] and sports director Rob Carlin left for [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], meaning WMAR's newscasts no longer have a separate sports anchor. Despite this, the station lays claim to the market's most aggressive coverage of local college and high school [[lacrosse]], arguably the most popular sport in the area among young athletes. WMAR works in partnership with [[ESPNU]] to produce the ''ABC 2 Lacrosse Game of the Week'' during the college season, featuring prime matchups involving one or more Maryland lacrosse powerhouses, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Loyola College in Maryland]], [[Towson University]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. Garceau continues to do play-by-play for the station's lacrosse telecasts. [[Quint Kessenich]], four-time lacrosse All-American with Johns Hopkins, is a major contributor to lacrosse coverage and appears sporadically as a fill-in anchor, host of the station's [[Baltimore Blast]] show and field reporter for select Ravens games.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, WMAR-TV became the last station in the market and the last Scripps-owned television station at the time to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]] (Scripps has since acquired the television station group of [[McGraw-Hill]]; of those stations, one of them still produces its newscasts in [[pillarbox]]ed [[4:3]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] as of January 2012). On April 18, 2011, WMAR became the first television station in Baltimore to expand its weekday morning newscast to the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2011-04-wmar_channel_goes_to_430_am_ne-story.html|title=WMAR Channel 2 Goes to 4:30am Newscast|last=Zurawik|first=David|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=18 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Curt Anderson]] \u2013 news reporter (a graduate of local \"[[Magnet school|magnet\"]] academic premier public high school - [[Baltimore City College]], currently in the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] in lower chamber of [[Maryland House of Delegates|House of Delegates]])<ref>http://www.delegatecurtanderson.com</ref>\n* [[Andy Barth]] \u2013 left WMAR to pursue a political career, his 2006 bid for U.S. Congress failed; now reporter for [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[Nelson Benton]] (1982\u20131983) former ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' correspondent (died February 13, 1988)\n* [[Keith Cate]] (now at [[WFLA-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg, Florida]])\n* [[Stu Kerr]] (1928\u20131994) \u2013 At station 1952\u20131981, longtime \"public face\" of the station, \"jack-of-all-trades\" from various hosts of early morning children's shows \u2013 a janitor on ''The Early Riser'', and comic roles as \"Professor Kool\" and \"[[Bozo the Clown]]\" to \"Mr. Fortune\" on ''Dialing for Dollars'' and weather forecaster.\n* [[Tom Marr]] \u2013 morning news anchor and news director for WFBR Radio AM 1300; sportscaster for CBS Radio; former [[Baltimore Orioles]] radio broadcaster; Longtime talk show host on conservative talk radio AM 680 [[WCBM]] in Baltimore, died in 2016)\n* [[Jim McKay]] \u2013 did early first broadcasts in late 1940s, (went on to host [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (American TV program)|Wide World of Sports]]'', died in 2008)\n* [[Uma Pemmaraju]] (now an anchor with [[Fox News Channel]])\n* [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]] (went on to [[ESPN]], died in 2016)\n* [[Sally Thorner]] (went on to anchor at competitor [[WJZ-TV]] channel 13, now retired)\n* [[Brian Wood (journalist)|Brian Wood]] (now at [[KATU]] in [[Portland, Oregon]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050319102326/http://www.scripps.com/corporateoverview/businesses/broadcast/wmar.shtml at Scripps.com])\n*{{TVQ|WMAR-TV}}\n*[https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3Aublangsdale%20AND%20subject%3A%22WMAR-TV%20%28Television%20Station%3A%20Baltimore%2C%20Md.%29%22 View archival footage held by the University of Baltimore]\n\n{{Baltimore TV}}\n{{Washington TV}}\n{{Susquehanna Valley TV}}\n{{ABC Maryland}}\n{{EWS CORP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wmar-Tv}}\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Maryland]]\n[[Category:ABC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Bounce TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates]]\n[[Category:E.
