The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\",<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> [[Fland Mainistrech]]'s poem \"Rig Themra dia tesband tn\u00fa\"<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G800011C/text004.html]</ref> in the [[Book of Leinster]] and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/revueceltique41pari/page/316/mode/2up/search/ambrois]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\",<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> [[Fland Mainistrech]]'s poem \"Rig Themra dia tesband tn\u00fa\"<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G800011C/text004.html]</ref> in the [[Book of Leinster]] and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

It consists of a host of landscape painters who worked from 1830 to 1950 on the banks of the [[Creuse (river)|Grande Creuse]], Petite Creuse, S\u00e9delle and Gargilesse rivers near the communes of Crozant and [[Fresselines]].\n\nThe \"Crozant School\" is simply a convenient name to designate all those who have found inspiration in the Creuse valleys: it is a \"school without a master\". In little more than a century, nearly 500 painters frequented the region.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071025214225/http://diren.dev.e-services.fr/donnees/sites_paysages/Atlas_paysage/atlas_paysage_P1.pdf Services DIREN]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Abandonment of neoclassical===\n[[File:John Constable - Cottage at East Bergholt.jpg|thumb|250px|''Cottage at East Bergholt'' by [[John Constable]]]]\nAt the start of the 19th century, artistic fashion had settled around the neoclassical tradition as exemplified by the work of the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]. Alongside this academicism, the romantic tradition formalized by [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault|Gericault]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington|Bonington]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] was gaining momentum.\n\nIn 1824, the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] exhibited some of the works of [[John Constable]]. His rural scenes had a decisive influence on younger artists, leading them to abandon the formalism of the time and take their inspiration from Nature. They produced paintings, often of rural scenes, that broke from the dramatic mythological themes.\n\nDuring the 1848 revolution, the painters that would soon be associated with Crozant school or the [[Barbizon school]] got together and deliberately opted to follow Constable's precepts, to make nature itself the subject of their paintings. Among them, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]] spread his vision of landscapes with figures, depicting peasants and farm work. ''[[The Gleaners]]'' (1857) is a perfect example, showing three peasant busy gleaning after the harvest, without staging or dramatic effects but simply an evocation of the simple life.\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin 002.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Creuze landscape by [[Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin]]]]\n\n===Origin of Crozant===\nFresselines is located about fifty kilometers from [[Nohant]], the home of [[George Sand]] (1804-1876).\nShe and her prestigious guests enjoyed walks in the Creuze valleys around Fresselines and Crozant.\nShe would evoke Crozant or Fresselines in several of her novels: ''Lettres d'un voyageur (Letters of a traveler)'',<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA253&dq=crozant%2Bsand&lr=&as_brr=1\n |page=253\n |title=Lettres d'un voyageur |volume=1\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=Meline, Cans |year=1838}}</ref>\n''Le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 de Monsieur Antoine (the Sin of Monsieur Antoine)''<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Bus-lI9RJQ0C\n |quote=crozant+sand.\n |title=Le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 de Monsieur Antoine |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Bus-lI9RJQ0C/page/n301 294]\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=Michel L\u00e9vy Fr\u00e8res |year=1857}}</ref>\nand ''Jeanne''.<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waEGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA50&dq=crozant%2Bsand&lr=&as_brr=1#PPA50,M1\n |page=50\n |title=Jeanne: suivie de Procope le grand |volume=1 \u00e0 2\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=R.

In little more than a century, nearly 500 painters frequented the region.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071025214225/http://diren.dev.e-services.fr/donnees/sites_paysages/Atlas_paysage/atlas_paysage_P1.pdf Services DIREN]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Abandonment of neoclassical===\n[[File:John Constable - Cottage at East Bergholt.jpg|thumb|250px|''Cottage at East Bergholt'' by [[John Constable]]]]\nAt the start of the 19th century, artistic fashion had settled around the neoclassical tradition as exemplified by the work of the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]. Alongside this academicism, the romantic tradition formalized by [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault|Gericault]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington|Bonington]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] was gaining momentum.\n\nIn 1824, the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] exhibited some of the works of [[John Constable]]. His rural scenes had a decisive influence on younger artists, leading them to abandon the formalism of the time and take their inspiration from Nature. They produced paintings, often of rural scenes, that broke from the dramatic mythological themes.\n\nDuring the 1848 revolution, the painters that would soon be associated with Crozant school or the [[Barbizon school]] got together and deliberately opted to follow Constable's precepts, to make nature itself the subject of their paintings. Among them, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]] spread his vision of landscapes with figures, depicting peasants and farm work. ''[[The Gleaners]]'' (1857) is a perfect example, showing three peasant busy gleaning after the harvest, without staging or dramatic effects but simply an evocation of the simple life.\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin 002.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Creuze landscape by [[Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin]]]]\n\n===Origin of Crozant===\nFresselines is located about fifty kilometers from [[Nohant]], the home of [[George Sand]] (1804-1876).\nShe and her prestigious guests enjoyed walks in the Creuze valleys around Fresselines and Crozant.\nShe would evoke Crozant or Fresselines in several of her novels: ''Lettres d'un voyageur (Letters of a traveler)'',<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA253&dq=crozant%2Bsand&lr=&as_brr=1\n |page=253\n |title=Lettres d'un voyageur |volume=1\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=Meline, Cans |year=1838}}</ref>\n''Le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 de Monsieur Antoine (the Sin of Monsieur Antoine)''<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Bus-lI9RJQ0C\n |quote=crozant+sand.\n |title=Le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 de Monsieur Antoine |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Bus-lI9RJQ0C/page/n301 294]\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=Michel L\u00e9vy Fr\u00e8res |year=1857}}</ref>\nand ''Jeanne''.<ref>{{cite book\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waEGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA50&dq=crozant%2Bsand&lr=&as_brr=1#PPA50,M1\n |page=50\n |title=Jeanne: suivie de Procope le grand |volume=1 \u00e0 2\n |author=George Sand\n |publisher=R.

Beginning in 1960, Winters recorded many classic [[comedy album]]s for the [[Verve Records]] label. He also had [[Jonathan Winters#Discography|records released every decade]] for over 50 years, receiving 11 Grammy nominations, including eight for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]], during his career. From these nominations, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children#1970s|Grammy Award for Best Album for Children]] for his contribution to [[List of The Little Prince adaptations#Vinyl record|an adaptation]] of ''[[The Little Prince]]'' in 1975 and the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards#Spoken|Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album]] for ''Crank(y) Calls'' in 1996.\n\nWith a career spanning more than six decades, Winters also appeared in hundreds of television shows and films, including eccentric characters on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', ''The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters'' (1972\u201374), ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. He also voiced [[List of The Smurfs characters#Protagonists|Grandpa Smurf]] on ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' TV series from 1986 to the show's conclusion in 1989. Over twenty years later, Winters was introduced to a new generation through voicing [[Papa Smurf]] in ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' (2013). Winters died nine days after recording his dialogue for ''The Smurfs 2''; the film was dedicated in his memory.\n\nIn 1991, Winters won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] for playing Gunny Davis in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Davis Rules]]''. 1999 saw Winters become the 2nd recipient of the prestigious [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]]. In 2002, he was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his performance as Q.T. Marlens on ''[[Life with Bonnie]]''. Winters was presented with a Pioneer [[TV Land Award]] by [[Robin Williams]] in 2008.\n\nWinters also spent time painting and presenting his artwork, including [[Screen printing|silkscreens]] and sketches, in many [[Art exhibition|gallery shows]]. He authored several books, with his book of short stories entitled ''[[Jonathan Winters#Bibliography|Winters' Tales]]'' (1988) making several bestseller lists.<ref name=\"Post obit\" />\n\n==Early life==\nWinters was born in [[Bellbrook, Ohio|Bellbrook]], Ohio, to  Jonathan Harshman Winters II<!--Do not change to Jr., he was named after his grandfather-->, an insurance agent who later became an investment broker.<ref name=\"film reference\" /><ref name=\"beverly\" /> He was a descendant of Valentine Winters, founder of the Winters National Bank in [[Dayton, Ohio]] (now part of [[JPMorgan Chase]]).

A poor student, Winters continued talking to himself and developed a repertoire of strange sound effects. He often entertained his high school friends by imitating a race at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].<ref name=\"Boston Globe obit\" />\n\nIn another television interview, Winters described how deeply he was hurt by his parents' divorce. He fought youthful tormentors who ridiculed him for not having a father in his life. When the tormentors were not around, he would go to a building or tree and weep in despair. Winters said that he learned to laugh at his situation but admitted that his adult life had been a response to sorrow.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[James Dobson]] |title=What wives wished their husbands knew about women |publisher=[[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]], [[Illinois]]: Tyndale House Publishers |year=1975 |page=167 |isbn=0-8423-7890-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring his senior year at [[South High School (Springfield, Ohio)|Springfield High School]], Winters [[Dropping out|quit school]] to join the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] at the age of seventeen and served two and a half years in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"beverly\"/><ref name=\"Corps Stories\" /><ref name=\"Springfield News Sun\" /> Upon his return, he attended [[Kenyon College]].

He was also a local radio personality on [[WING]] (mornings, 6 to 8) in Dayton, Ohio, and at [[WIZE]] in Springfield, Ohio. He performed as \"Johnny Winters\" on [[WBNS-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], for two and a half years. Jerome R. \"Ted\" Reeves, then program director for WBNS-TV, arranged for his first audition with [[CBS]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"YT\"/>\n\nAfter promising his wife that he would return to Dayton if he did not make it in a year, and with $56.46 in his pocket, he moved to New York City, staying with friends in Greenwich Village. After obtaining Martin Goodman as his agent, he began stand-up routines in various New York nightclubs. His earliest network television appearance was in 1954 on ''[[Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series)|Chance of a Lifetime]]'' hosted by [[Dennis James]] on the [[DuMont Television Network]], where Winters again appeared as \"Johnny Winters.\"\n\nWinters made [[History of television|television history]] in 1956 when [[RCA]] broadcast the first public demonstration of color [[videotape]] on ''The Jonathan Winters Show''. Author [[David Hajdu]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (2006), \"He soon used video technology 'to appear as two characters,' bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time.

In the ads, he provided the voices of talking beer steins, named Shultz and Dooley. Later, he became a spokesman for [[Hefty]] brand trash bags, for whom he appeared as a dapper [[Waste collector|garbageman]] known for collecting \"gahr-bahj,\" as well as \"Maude Frickert\" and other characters.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObGR5AaqLkc&NR=1|publisher=YouTube|title= 1970's Hefty Scrap Bags (Jonathan Winters) Commercial}}</ref>\n\nWinters recorded many classic [[comedy album]]s for the [[Verve Records]] label, starting in 1960. Probably the best known of his characters from this period is \"Maude Frickert\", the seemingly sweet old lady with the barbed tongue. He was a favorite of [[Jack Paar]], who hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from 1957 to 1962, and appeared frequently on his television programs, even going so far as to impersonate then\u2013U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] over the telephone as a prank on Paar.\n\nWinters had a dramatic role in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[A Game of Pool (1961)|A Game of Pool]]\" (episode 3.5 aired on October 13, 1961). He also recorded [[Ogden Nash]]'s ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' poems to [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s classical opus.\n\nOn ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1962\u201392), Winters usually performed in the guise of some character. [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] often did not know what Winters had planned and usually had to tease out the character's backstory during a pretend interview. Carson invented a character called \"Aunt Blabby,\" which was similar to and possibly inspired by \"Maude Frickert.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead-groundbreaking-improv-comic-was-87/|title=Fox News obituary|work=Fox News|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer10.jpg|thumb|''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)]]\nWinters appeared in more than 50 movies and many television shows, including particularly notable roles in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and in the dual roles of Henry Glenworthy and his dark, scheming brother, the Rev.

It featured guest stars (including [[The Doors]]), comedy sketches (often featuring Winters characters such as Maudie Frickert, rural Elwood P. Suggins, drunk Harold Nermlinger, Norwegian Yorny Bjorny); and an audience-request section where Winters did impressions of persons, animals, etc. in various situations (e.g. John Wayne on the moon). Choice bits from the latter were collected and released on a 1969 Columbia LP, \"Stuff 'n' Nonsense\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jonathan-Winters-Stuff-N-Nonsense/release/1748094 |title=Jonathan Winters - Stuff 'N Nonsense (1969, Vinyl) |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nHe later participated on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'', hosted by [[Grits Gresham]], who took celebrities on hunting, fishing, and shooting trips to exotic places around the world.\n\nWinters made memorable appearances on both ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', as well as a regular on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.

In 1981 he was a guest on the short-lived comedy series ''[[Aloha Paradise]]''.\n\nIn the [[Mork & Mindy#Fourth season|fourth and final season]] of the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]]-styled TV comedy ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', Jonathan Winters (one of [[Robin Williams]]'s idols) was brought in as Mork & Mindy's child, Mearth. Due to the different Orkan physiology, [[Mork & Mindy|Mork]] laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged \"backwards,\" thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress [[Louanne Sirota]]). Mork's infant son Mearth in ''Mork & Mindy'' was created in hopes of improving ratings and as an attempt to capitalize on Williams's comedic talents. Winters had previously guest-starred in Season 3, Episode 18, as Dave McConnell, Mindy's uncle. However, after multiple scheduling and cast changes, ''Mork & Mindy''&apos;s fourth season was already quite low in the ratings and ended up being the show's last season.\n\n[[File:Jonathan-Winters 1986.JPEG|thumb|upright|Winters performing at a [[USO]] show in 1986]]\n\nWinters became a regular on ''[[Hee Haw]]'' during the 1983\u20131984 season. He was later the voice of [[Grandpa Smurf]] from 1986 to 1990 on the television series ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. Additionally, he did the [[voice acting|voice]] of Bigelow in the 1985 TV film ''[[Pound Puppies (TV special)|Pound Puppies]]'' and voice-acted on ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'' in 1985, among other voice roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1987, Winters was featured in [[NFL Films]]' ''[[Football Follies|The NFL TV Follies]]''. That same year he published ''Winters' Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual''.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, he had a supporting role on ''[[Davis Rules]]'', a sitcom that lasted two seasons (25 episodes), for which he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. He played Gunny Davis, an eccentric grandfather who was helping raise his grandchildren after his son lost his wife.\n\nIn addition to his live-action roles, he was a guest star on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (in an episode where he also voiced an animated version of his \"Maude Frickert\" character) and as the narrator in ''[[Frosty Returns]]'' which [[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)#Television rights|airs annually]] aired during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]]. Winters also provided the voice for the thief in ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.\n\nIn 1994, Winters appeared as a fired factory worker (credited as \"Grizzled Man\") in ''[[The Flintstones]]''. In an interesting role reversal, he was the serious-minded secular police chief and uncle of the character Lamont Cranston (played by [[Alec Baldwin]]) in ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]''. That same year he voiced Stinkbomb D. Basset in the episode \"Smell Ya Later\" on ''[[Animaniacs]]''.\n\nWinters received eleven Grammy nominations during his career, including eight for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]; he won the [[Grammy Awards of 1996#Spoken|Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album]] for ''Crank(y) Calls'' in 1996.<ref>Dagan, Carmel.\n[https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/jonathan-winters-dead-at-87-1200354170/#1/jonathan-winters-in-1965/ \u201cComedian Jonathan Winters Dead at 87\u201d], ''Variety'', April 12, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Winters played himself in ''Bloopy's Buddies'', a children's TV series on [[PBS]] designed to teach children about health and nutrition and to encourage them to exercise.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/bloopys-buddies/ ''Bloopy's Buddies''] at TV.com</ref>\n\nIn 1999, he was awarded the [[John F.

The comic suffered from [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]] and [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=\"Post obit\" /> With an unprecedented frenetic energy, Winters made obscure references to his illness and hospitalization during his [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routines]], most famously on his 1960 comedy album, ''[[The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters]]''. During his classic \"flying saucer\" routine, Winters casually mentions that if he wasn't careful, the authorities might put him back in the \"zoo\", referring to the institution.\n\n\"These voices are always screaming to get out,\" Winters told the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''. \"They follow me around pretty much all day and night.\" Winters was able to use his talents in [[voice-over]] roles as a result. A devotee of [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], Winters once claimed, \"I've done for the most part pretty much what I intended.\" He told ''[[U.S. News & World Report|U.S. News]]'', \"I ended up doing comedy, writing, and painting.... I've had a ball, and as I get older I just become an older kid.\"<ref name=\"Huffingtonpost obit\" />\n\nWinters lived near [[Santa Barbara, California]], and was often seen browsing or \"hamming\" for the crowd at the [[antique]] and gun shows on the [[Ventura County Fair|Ventura County fairgrounds]]. He often entertained the tellers and other employees whenever he visited his local bank to make a deposit or withdrawal. Additionally, he spent his time painting and attended many [[art museum|gallery showings]], even presenting his art in one-man shows.\n\nOn January 11, 2009, Winters' wife of more than 60 years, Eileen, died at the age of 84 after a 20-year battle with [[breast cancer]].<ref>[http://www.mccrearyrecord.com/opinion/local_story_013141453.html?keyword=secondarystory Write On: \"Behind Every Great Man...\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202203844/http://www.mccrearyrecord.com/opinion/local_story_013141453.html?keyword=secondarystory |date=February 2, 2009 }}, ''McCreary County Record'', January 13, 2009</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWinters died of [[death by natural causes|natural causes]] on the evening of April 11, 2013, in [[Montecito, California]], at the age of 87.<ref name=\"beverly\"/><ref name=\"NY Times obit\" /><ref name=\"Baltimore News Journal\" />\nHe was survived by his two children, Jonathan (\"Jay\") Winters IV and Lucinda Winters, and five grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news|author=William Grimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/television/jonathan-winters-comedian-dies-at-87.html |title=Jonathan Winters, Unpredictable Comedian, Dies at 87 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/tv/tvguide/article/Comedian-Jonathan-Winters-Dies-at-87-4430400.php Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413165813/http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/tv/tvguide/article/Comedian-Jonathan-Winters-Dies-at-87-4430400.php |date=April 13, 2013 }}</ref> He was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.\n\nFans of Winters placed flowers on his [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star on April 12, 2013, at 1:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"CBS LA obit\" />\n\nMany comedians, actors, and friends gave personal tributes about Winters on [[social media]] shortly after his death.

With notable honors, many television show, film and [[Stand-up comedy|comedy circuit]] appearances, Winters was known to start his stage shows by commanding an applauding audience that had risen to its feet to: \"Please remain standing throughout the evening.\"<ref name=\"Post obit\" />\n\nWinters performed a wide range of characters: [[hillbilly|hillbillies]], arrogant [[city slicker]]s, nerve-shattered airline pilots trying to hide their fear, disgruntled [[Western (genre)|westerners]], judgmental [[Martian]]s, little old ladies, nosy gas station attendants, a hungry cat eyeing a mouse, the oldest living airline stewardess, and more. \"I was fighting for the fact that you could be funny without telling jokes,\" he told ''[[The New York Times]]'', adding that he thought of himself foremost as a writer and less as a stand-up comedian. He named [[James Thurber]]'s sophisticated absurdity as influential and said he idolized writers with a gift for humor.<ref name=\"Post obit\" />\n\nTwo of his most memorable characters, cranky granny \"Maude Frickert\" and [[Yokel|bumpkin]] farmer \"Elwood P. Suggins\" (\"I think eggs 24 hours a day\"), were born from his early television routines. [[Robin Williams]] once told ''[[Playboy]]'' why Mr. Winters inspired him. \"It was like seeing a guy behind a mask, and you could see that his characters were a great way for him to talk about painful stuff,\" he said. \"I found out later that they are people he knows\u2014his mother, his aunt.

After obtaining Martin Goodman as his agent, he began stand-up routines in various New York nightclubs. His earliest network television appearance was in 1954 on ''[[Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series)|Chance of a Lifetime]]'' hosted by [[Dennis James]] on the [[DuMont Television Network]], where Winters again appeared as \"Johnny Winters.\"\n\nWinters made [[History of television|television history]] in 1956 when [[RCA]] broadcast the first public demonstration of color [[videotape]] on ''The Jonathan Winters Show''. Author [[David Hajdu]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (2006), \"He soon used video technology 'to appear as two characters,' bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time.

In the ads, he provided the voices of talking beer steins, named Shultz and Dooley. Later, he became a spokesman for [[Hefty]] brand trash bags, for whom he appeared as a dapper [[Waste collector|garbageman]] known for collecting \"gahr-bahj,\" as well as \"Maude Frickert\" and other characters.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObGR5AaqLkc&NR=1|publisher=YouTube|title= 1970's Hefty Scrap Bags (Jonathan Winters) Commercial}}</ref>\n\nWinters recorded many classic [[comedy album]]s for the [[Verve Records]] label, starting in 1960. Probably the best known of his characters from this period is \"Maude Frickert\", the seemingly sweet old lady with the barbed tongue. He was a favorite of [[Jack Paar]], who hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from 1957 to 1962, and appeared frequently on his television programs, even going so far as to impersonate then\u2013U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] over the telephone as a prank on Paar.\n\nHowever, Winters had a dramatic role in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[A Game of Pool (1961)|A Game of Pool]]\" (episode 3.5 aired on October 13, 1961). He also recorded [[Ogden Nash]]'s ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' poems to [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s classical opus.\n\nOn ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1962\u201392), Winters usually performed in the guise of some character. [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] often did not know what Winters had planned and usually had to tease out the character's backstory during a pretend interview. Carson invented a character called \"Aunt Blabby,\" which was similar to and possibly inspired by \"Maude Frickert.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead-groundbreaking-improv-comic-was-87/|title=Fox News obituary|work=Fox News|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer10.jpg|thumb|''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)]]\nWinters appeared in more than 50 movies and many television shows, including particularly notable roles in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and in the dual roles of Henry Glenworthy and his dark, scheming brother, the Rev.

It featured guest stars (including [[The Doors]]), comedy sketches (often featuring Winters characters such as Maudie Frickert, rural Elwood P. Suggins, drunk Harold Nermlinger, Norwegian Yorny Bjorny); and an audience-request section where Winters did impressions of persons, animals, etc. in various situations (e.g. John Wayne on the moon). Choice bits from the latter were collected and released on a 1969 Columbia LP, \"Stuff 'n' Nonsense\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jonathan-Winters-Stuff-N-Nonsense/release/1748094 |title=Jonathan Winters - Stuff 'N Nonsense (1969, Vinyl) |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nHe later participated on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'', hosted by [[Grits Gresham]], who took celebrities on hunting, fishing, and shooting trips to exotic places around the world.\n\nWinters made memorable appearances on both ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', as well as a regular on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.

That same year, he also appeared in ''[[I Go Pogo]]'' (a.k.a. ''Pogo for President''). In 1981 he was a guest on the short-lived comedy series ''[[Aloha Paradise]]''.\n\nIn the [[Mork & Mindy#Fourth season|fourth and final season]] of the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]]-styled TV comedy ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', Jonathan Winters (one of [[Robin Williams]]'s idols) was brought in as Mork & Mindy's child, Mearth. Due to the different Orkan physiology, [[Mork & Mindy|Mork]] laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged \"backwards,\" thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress [[Louanne Sirota]]). Mork's infant son Mearth in ''Mork & Mindy'' was created in hopes of improving ratings and as an attempt to capitalize on Williams's comedic talents. Winters had previously guest-starred in Season 3, Episode 18, as Dave McConnell, Mindy's uncle. However, after multiple scheduling and cast changes, ''Mork & Mindy''&apos;s fourth season was already quite low in the ratings and ended up being the show's last season.\n\n[[File:Jonathan-Winters 1986.JPEG|thumb|upright|Winters performing at a [[USO]] show in 1986]]\n\nWinters became a regular on ''[[Hee Haw]]'' during the 1983\u20131984 season. He was later the voice of [[Grandpa Smurf]] from 1986 to 1990 on the television series ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. Additionally, he did the [[voice acting|voice]] of Bigelow in the 1985 TV film ''[[Pound Puppies (TV special)|Pound Puppies]]'' and voice-acted on ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'' in 1985, among other voice roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1987, Winters was featured in [[NFL Films]]' ''[[Football Follies|The NFL TV Follies]]''. That same year he published ''Winters' Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual''.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, he had a supporting role on ''[[Davis Rules]]'', a sitcom that lasted two seasons (25 episodes), for which he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. He played Gunny Davis, an eccentric grandfather who was helping raise his grandchildren after his son lost his wife.\n\nIn addition to his live-action roles, he was a guest star on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (in an episode where he also voiced an animated version of his \"Maude Frickert\" character) and as the narrator in ''[[Frosty Returns]]'' which [[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)#Television rights|airs annually]] aired during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]]. Winters also provided the voice for the thief in ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.\n\nIn 1994, Winters appeared as a fired factory worker (credited as \"Grizzled Man\") in ''[[The Flintstones]]''. In an interesting role reversal, he was the serious-minded secular police chief and uncle of the character Lamont Cranston (played by [[Alec Baldwin]]) in ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]''. That same year he voiced Stinkbomb D. Basset in the episode \"Smell Ya Later\" on ''[[Animaniacs]]''.\n\nWinters received eleven Grammy nominations during his career, including eight for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]; he won the [[Grammy Awards of 1996#Spoken|Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album]] for ''Crank(y) Calls'' in 1996.<ref>Dagan, Carmel.\n[https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/jonathan-winters-dead-at-87-1200354170/#1/jonathan-winters-in-1965/ \u201cComedian Jonathan Winters Dead at 87\u201d], ''Variety'', April 12, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Winters played himself in ''Bloopy's Buddies'', a children's TV series on [[PBS]] designed to teach children about health and nutrition and to encourage them to exercise.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/bloopys-buddies/ ''Bloopy's Buddies''] at TV.com</ref>\n\nIn 1999, he was awarded the [[John F.

Later in the year a second group of five novels were added to the series: ''Sons of the Ocean Deeps'' by Bryce Walton, ''Mists of Dawn'' by Chad Oliver, ''Rocket Jockey'' by Phillip St. John, ''Islands in the Sky'' by Arthur Clarke, and ''Vault of the Ages'' by Poul Anderson.

Contributors include [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Hugo]] winning artists like [[Alex Schomburg]] (who also created the endpapers used in every book of the series) and [[Virgil Finlay]], as well Hugo nominees like [[Mel Hunter]], and [[Ed Emshwiller]]. There is even a cover (\"The Ant Men\") by [[Paul Blaisdell]], best known for his imaginatively extreme monsters in low-budget science fiction movies of the 1950s, such as \"[[It Conquered the World]]\"\n\nWinston cover art features colorful images of [[spaceflight]], [[exploration]] (of Earth, Space, and Time) and other fantastical subject matter describing important scenes from each book. The art is similar in style to [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] art of the time, but like the novels themselves, the art tends towards a believable and accurate portrayal of the subject matter. Artists like Mel Hunter had extensive training in scientific and technical illustration, and a broad knowledge of space technologies. This gives the covers a more serious feel than some other art of the time, and compliments the educational attitude the authors took in writing their factual forewords describing the science and technology that appears in the books.\n\n== Books ==\nThe series was not numbered.

Later in the year a second group of five novels were added to the series: ''Sons of the Ocean Deeps'' by Bryce Walton, ''Mists of Dawn'' by Chad Oliver, ''Rocket Jockey'' by Phillip St. John, ''Islands in the Sky'' by Arthur Clarke, and ''Vault of the Ages'' by Poul Anderson.

Contributors include [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Hugo]] winning artists like [[Alex Schomburg]] (who also created the endpapers used in every book of the series) and [[Virgil Finlay]], as well Hugo nominees like [[Mel Hunter]], and [[Ed Emshwiller]]. There is even a cover (\"The Ant Men\") by [[Paul Blaisdell]], best known for his imaginatively extreme monsters in low-budget science fiction movies of the 1950s, such as \"[[It Conquered the World]]\" \n\nWinston cover art features colorful images of [[spaceflight]], [[exploration]] (of Earth, Space, and Time) and other fantastical subject matter describing important scenes from each book. The art is similar in style to [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] art of the time, but like the novels themselves, the art tends towards a believable and accurate portrayal of the subject matter. Artists like Mel Hunter had extensive training in scientific and technical illustration, and a broad knowledge of space technologies. This gives the covers a more serious feel than some other art of the time, and compliments the educational attitude the authors took in writing their factual forewords describing the science and technology that appears in the books.\n\n== Books ==\nThe series was not numbered. This chronological list identifies the artists who usually illustrated the dustjackets only (\"cover\"), occasionally illustrated the novels too (\"cover and interior illus.\").\n\n* ''[[Earthbound (book)|Earthbound]]'' by [[Milton Lesser]], cover by Peter Poulton (1952)\n* ''[[Find the Feathered Serpent]]'', [[Evan Hunter]], cover [[Henry Sharp (artist)|Henry Sharp]] (1952)\n* ''[[Five Against Venus]]'', [[Robert S.
