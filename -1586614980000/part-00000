Fauzia's older sister Nazia is married and she constantly keeps getting beaten by her husband. Fauzia keeps telling Nazia to not allow her husband to hit her which keeps enraging her brother-in-law (Nazia's husband) Fauzia is the apple of her father's eye; Fauzia's mother also loves her, however, she punishes Fauzia as Fauzia is outspoken and rebellious.\n\nFauzia's sister-in-law (Asma) is manipulative and has the complete control over her husband. Asma's brother Sajid falls in love with Fauzia and compels Asma to ask for her hand. Asma is strongly against the marriage as she does not want her brother to marry such a 'sharp' woman. Sajid manages  to convince his sister who, in turn, convinces Rahim, and that too very easily. Rahim and Asma talk to Fauzia's parents about the proposal, who are initially reluctant but finally succumb to the pressure exerted by the couple, and Sajids mother, and, eventually confirm the proposal. However, Fauzia rejects the relation firstly because Sajid was a lazy jobless person who would sit on the road all day doing nothing and also because  she has dreams of becoming famous and independent - creating a social career. Hence marrying Sajid would derail her dreams. But Fauzia's family tells her that it is too late to refuse to the marriage as the whole village has been told about it and calling off the engagement just before the wedding would ruin their reputation.\n\nFauzia, however falls in love with Abid, the owner of a cosmetic shop in her neighbourhood who recently returned from Dubai. Abid has promised to allow and help her to accomplish all her dreams and gives her many magazines of models. Fauzia tries her best to marry him and he even sends his proposal through is mother but Fauzia's mother rejects. Her wedding day with Sajid arrives but she escapes right before the ceremony.\n\nHaving no other option left, she goes to the Chaudhry and Chaudrani of the village, who help and tell her father to get Fauzia married to Abid. Fauzia and Abid, in due course, get married. However, Abid loses interest in Fauzia after their marriage. Soon, they have a son. Soon, Fauzia discovers that Abid is having an affair with Ruby, leading to conflict between Fauzia and Abid, but they reunite, but occasionally continue to fight. Fauzia wants to be a model as Abid had promised to allow her to, but after the marriage he insists her to sit at home and raise their child. Abid, also physically abuses Fauzia. Amidst his outrageous fighting he divorced Fauzia and throws her out of his house. Devastated, she leaves the village and travels to Karachi to be a model and make a career and provide for her initial family. The company she works for sends her a beautician Gogi/Rehaan (Khalid Malik) who gives her a makeover, improves her English and gives her lessons of speaking English with an accent. Meanwhile, Abid, who has divorced Fauzia, marries Ruby and gives legal custody of his child to his sister to take care for. After hearing of this news, Fauzia become depressed - and is, now, desperate to get a job and reclaim her child. Meanwhile, the company owner/boss, Gauhar introduced Fauzia to the party life of elite class. Enraged, Fauzia leaves the company as soon as she realizes this and decides to go to a woman's hostel. The caretaker of the hostel is an evil woman and seeing Fauzia for how she was, she decides to send her as an escort to a rich man's house. Fauzia realizes this when she reaches the house and meets with the rich man. Fauzia runs from there and goes back to Gogi/Rehaan [((Khalid Malik))] and starts living with him. But for many months, she does not get work. So, although reluctantly but given the circumstances, she desperately returns to the company that she was initially in, by apologizing to the boss, Gauhar. Gradually, she starts refining herself and agrees to work on Gauhar's terms, earning money. She started uploading her videos on social media and gained a lot of fan following as well as bashing and haters. After many episodes, the entry of Shehryar (Osman Khalid Butt) takes place and Fauzia and Shehryar start getting closer. Shehryar is a widower who lost his first wife and daughter in an accident few years ago and he starts falling for Fauzia's true real innocent nature. However she does not reveal about her marriage, divorce or son. Meanwhile, Fauzia's father, faces an accident which results in the cutting of one of his legs. So, Fauzia meets her family in the hospital after a very long time and pays off for all her father's hospital expenses by working however and whatever way she can. She even takes a house in the city (on rent) and shifts her family (excluding her elder brother and his wife) to the city for some days until her father gets a new leg fixed at a private hospital in the city. Meanwhile, she gets close to her family and also provides them with all the amenities which were not available in the village. She also lends money to her elder brother, just to pay - off his rent and other debts and to maintain a cordial relationship with him. Moreover, Shehryar gives a diamond ring to Fauzia and proposes to her in an indirect manner. Initially she agrees but she refuses when she thinks herself as unworthy of his love. However, she gradually realizes that agreeing to marry him would result in her getting a safe exit from the world of glamour. She agrees to marry him. Overjoyed, Shehryar takes Fauzia to his house and makes his mother meet Fauzia. Her life seemed to get calm when all of a sudden a breaking news is shared on television channels which mentions her real name (Fauzia, instead of Kanwal) and reveals the details of her past including her marriage and child. The TV channels also showed interview of her ex-husband who twisted the facts and stated that she ran away from his house on the pretext of working in media and did n0t even care about her infant son. The son who was now a few years of age, had completely no memory of his mother and hence agreed to what his father had fed him against his mother. This broke Fauzia's heart very badly since she did not expect to be hated by her own son and that, too on baseless lies. On the other hand, Sheheryar feels hurt on finding out the truth in this way. However his mother tells him to give Fauzia at least a chance to tell her side of the story. On hearing the truth from her own mouth, Shehryar's affection and respect for Fauzia increases and he promises to never leave her and assured her that one day he will help her bring back her son because his daughter was dead but her son was alive. They happily decide to start the wedding preparations and she meanwhile decides to pay a final visit to her parents' house.\n\nThe media breaking her past story also became the cause of her own family including her parents and siblings finding out her job and they were all extremely angry at her since Fauzia had previously told them that she earned her money by working on a boutique. However, when she visits them and informs them of her decision to marry Shehryar, their anger starts to subside. However, her younger brother, who now had become a drug addict, was mocked by his friends and peers for having such a reckless sister who was bringing shame to the name of their family. He drugs her and then strangles her in her semi- conscious state. Fauzia's whole life flashes in front of her eyes as she makes frail attempts to free herself. Eventually she dies and her brother runs away. Next morning her younger sister finds her dead body in the room. The news soon spreads like wildfire and media breaks the news which ultimately reaches Sheheryar as well who is numb with grief. Fauzia's brother is arrested by police and Fauzia's father cried helplessly on his daughter's murder. He initially did not want to forgive his son however he reluctantly had to give in to his elder son and Fauzia's mother's plea. A woman is shown visiting Fauzia's father who, after paying condolences, asks for his permission to make a documentary on Fauzia's life. He gives the permission and as a token of thanks, the lady hands him over an envelope containing money which he later hands over to Fauzia's mother saying Fauzia sent that money. The last scene of the drama shows Shehryar sitting on Fauzia's grave and recalling all the good times he had spent with her since the time he had first met her. He remembers how once, she had mentioned to him about her love for red roses, adding as a joke to bring two dozen red flowers to her grave in case she dies. He had hushed away her joke but she in her carefree mood, had made him promise to do that. Pulling himself out of the flashback, a teary eyed Shehryar puts a bouquet of two dozen red roses on her grave and leaves.\nThe end of the drama shows a burning candle with Fauzia's voice in the background, addressing society, stating that she had left the world, however good or bad she was. She adds that the society snatched away her any chances of redemption. She questions in the end whether the society was pure now, after killing her. The candle is blown off.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Saba Qamar]] as Fauzia Batool/Kanwal Baloch\n*[[Osman Khalid Butt]] as Shehreyar (Kanwal's love interest)\n*[[Khalid Malik]] as Rehaan (Kanwal's best friend)\n*[[Ali Kazmi]] as Abid (Fauzia's husband) \n*[[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Raheem (Fauzia's elder brother)\n*[[Irfan Khoosat]] as Fauzia's father\n*[[Saba Faisal (actress)|Saba Faisal]] as Fauzia's mother\n*[[Nimra Khan]] as Munni Fauzia's younger sister \n*[[Nadia Afgan]] as Asma (Fauzia's sister-in-law)\n*[[Seemi Raheel]] as Abid's mother\n*Syed Tabrez Ali Shah as Munna Fauzia's younger brother\n*Syed Babrik Shah\n*[[Laila Zuberi]] as Shehreyar's mother\n*[[Mani (actor)|Mani]]\n*Tahir Jatoi\n*Sophia Mirza\n*Tahir Latif Saqi\n*Nishoo\n*Farhana Maqsood as Abid's second wife\n*Farah Tufail\n*Muskan Jay as Abid's sister\n*Rabia Abid Ali (Noreen)\n*Imran Ali Sheikh\n*Raja Matloob\n*Fahad Sherwani\n*Usman Mazhar\n*Ali Deswali\n*Amna Karim\n*Mahrukh Rizvi\n*Wahaj Khan\n*Salma Shaheen\n*Mehboob Sultan\n*Urooj Abbas\n*Anees Alam\n*Omair Ali Bhutto\n*Abdullah Malik\n*Meerub Shahid\n*Muhammad Subhan\n*Sunaina Shehzad\n*Ali Saqi\n*Bahawal Tofeeq\n*Ibrahim Tariq \n*Munawar noor\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Yasir Hussain]] as [[Sohail Warraich]]\n* [[Yasir Nawaz]]\n* Ali Saqi \n* [[Hareem Farooq]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Goher Mumtaz]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* Nomi Ansari as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Hira Tareen]]\n* [[Naeem Tahir]]\n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Chaudhrani Ji\n* Ahmed Godil\n* Hasan Soomro\n* [[Farooq Rind]]\n* Amna Karim\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

Fauzia's older sister Nazia is married and she constantly keeps getting beaten by her husband. Fauzia keeps telling Nazia to not allow her husband to hit her which keeps enraging her brother-in-law (Nazia's husband) Fauzia is the apple of her father's eye; Fauzia's mother also loves her, however, she tries to her full potential to discipline Fauzia as Fauzia is an outspoken and rebellious girl.\n\nFauzia's sister-in-law (Asma) is a manipulative woman who has the complete control over her husband. Asma's brother Sajid falls in love with Fauzia and compulses Asma to ask for her hand. Asma is strongly against the marriage as she does not want her brother to marry such a 'sharp' woman. Sajid manages  to convince his sister who, in turn, convinces Rahim, and that too very easily. Rahim and Asma talk to Fauzia's parents about the proposal, who are initially reluctant but finally succumb to the pressure exerted by the couple, and Sajids mother, and, eventually confirm the proposal. However, Fauzia rejects the relation firstly because Sajid was a lazy jobless person who would sit on the road all day doing nothing and also because  she has dreams of becoming famous and independent - creating a social career. Hence marrying Sajid would derail her dreams. But Fauzia's family tells her that it is too late to refuse to the marriage as the whole village has been told about it and calling off the engagement just before the wedding would ruin their reputation.\n\nFauzia, however falls in love with Abid, the owner of a cosmetic shop in her neighbourhood who recently came back from Dubai. Abid has promised to allow and help her to accomplish all her dreams and gives her many magazines of models. Fauzia tries her best to marry him and he even sends his proposal through is mother but Fauzia's mother rejects. Her wedding day with Sajid arrives but she escapes right before the ceremony.\n\nHaving no other option left, she goes to the Chaudhry and Chaudrani of the village, who help and tell her father to get Fauzia married to Abid. Fauzia and Abid, in due course, get married. However, Abid loses interest in Fauzia after their marriage. Soon, they have a son together. Soon, Fauzia discovers that Abid is having an affair with a girl called Ruby, due to which, Fauzia and Abid have a major fight though they reunite but continue to fight every now and then. Fauzia wants to be a model as Abid had promised to allow her to, but after the marriage he insists her to sit at home and raise their child. Abid, also physically abuses Fauzia. Amidst his outrageous fighting he divorced Fauzia and throws her out of his house. Devastated, she leaves the village and travels to Karachi to be a model and make a career and provide for her initial family. The company she works for sends her a beautician Gogi/Rehaan (Khalid Malik) who gives her a makeover, improves her English and gives her lessons of speaking English with an accent. Meanwhile, Abid, who has divorced Fauzia, marries Ruby and gives legal custody of his child to his sister to take care for. After hearing of this news, Fauzia become depressed - and is, now, desperate to get a job and reclaim her child. Meanwhile, the company owner/boss, Gauhar introduced Fauzia to the party life of elite class. Enraged, Fauzia leaves the company as soon as she realizes this and decides to go to a woman's hostel. The caretaker of the hostel is an evil woman and seeing Fauzia for how she was, she decides to send her as an escort to a rich man's house. Fauzia realizes this when she reaches the house and meets with the rich man. Fauzia runs from there and goes back to Gogi/Rehaan [((Khalid Malik))] and starts living with him. But for many months, she does not get work. So, although reluctantly but given the circumstances, she desperately returns to the company that she was initially in, by apologizing to the boss, Gauhar. Gradually, she starts refining herself and agrees to work on Gauhar's terms, earning money. She started uploading her videos on social media and gained a lot of fan following as well as bashing and haters. After many episodes, the entry of Shehryar (Osman Khalid Butt) takes place and Fauzia and Shehryar start getting closer. Shehryar is a widower who lost his first wife and daughter in an accident few years ago and he starts falling for Fauzia's true real innocent nature. However she does not reveal about her marriage, divorce or son. Meanwhile, Fauzia's father, faces an accident which results in the cutting of one of his legs. So, Fauzia meets her family in the hospital after a very long time and pays off for all her father's hospital expenses by working however and whatever way she can. She even takes a house in the city (on rent) and shifts her family (excluding her elder brother and his wife) to the city for some days until her father gets a new leg fixed at a private hospital in the city. Meanwhile, she gets close to her family and also provides them with all the amenities which were not available in the village. She also lends money to her elder brother, just to pay - off his rent and other debts and to maintain a cordial relationship with him. Moreover, Shehryar gives a diamond ring to Fauzia and proposes to her in an indirect manner. Initially she agrees but she refuses when she thinks herself as unworthy of his love. However, she gradually realizes that agreeing to marry him would result in her getting a safe exit from the world of glamour. She agrees to marry him. Overjoyed, Shehryar takes Fauzia to his house and makes his mother meet Fauzia. Her life seemed to get calm when all of a sudden a breaking news is shared on television channels which mentions her real name (Fauzia, instead of Kanwal) and reveals the details of her past including her marriage and child. The TV channels also showed interview of her ex-husband who twisted the facts and stated that she ran away from his house on the pretext of working in media and did n0t even care about her infant son. The son who was now a few years of age, had completely no memory of his mother and hence agreed to what his father had fed him against his mother. This broke Fauzia's heart very badly since she did not expect to be hated by her own son and that, too on baseless lies. On the other hand, Sheheryar feels hurt on finding out the truth in this way. However his mother tells him to give Fauzia at least a chance to tell her side of the story. On hearing the truth from her own mouth, Shehryar's affection and respect for Fauzia increases and he promises to never leave her and assured her that one day he will help her bring back her son because his daughter was dead but her son was alive. They happily decide to start the wedding preparations and she meanwhile decides to pay a final visit to her parents' house.\n\nThe media breaking her past story also became the cause of her own family including her parents and siblings finding out her job and they were all extremely angry at her since Fauzia had previously told them that she earned her money by working on a boutique. However, when she visits them and informs them of her decision to marry Shehryar, their anger starts to subside. However, her younger brother, who now had become a drug addict, was mocked by his friends and peers for having such a reckless sister who was bringing shame to the name of their family. He drugs her and then strangles her in her semi- conscious state. Fauzia's whole life flashes in front of her eyes as she makes frail attempts to free herself. Eventually she dies and her brother runs away. Next morning her younger sister finds her dead body in the room. The news soon spreads like wildfire and media breaks the news which ultimately reaches Sheheryar as well who is numb with grief. Fauzia's brother is arrested by police and Fauzia's father cried helplessly on his daughter's murder. He initially did not want to forgive his son however he reluctantly had to give in to his elder son and Fauzia's mother's plea. A woman is shown visiting Fauzia's father who, after paying condolences, asks for his permission to make a documentary on Fauzia's life. He gives the permission and as a token of thanks, the lady hands him over an envelope containing money which he later hands over to Fauzia's mother saying Fauzia sent that money. The last scene of the drama shows Shehryar sitting on Fauzia's grave and recalling all the good times he had spent with her since the time he had first met her. He remembers how once, she had mentioned to him about her love for red roses, adding as a joke to bring two dozen red flowers to her grave in case she dies. He had hushed away her joke but she in her carefree mood, had made him promise to do that. Pulling himself out of the flashback, a teary eyed Shehryar puts a bouquet of two dozen red roses on her grave and leaves.\nThe end of the drama shows a burning candle with Fauzia's voice in the background, addressing society, stating that she had left the world, however good or bad she was. She adds that the society snatched away her any chances of redemption. She questions in the end whether the society was pure now, after killing her. The candle is blown off.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Saba Qamar]] as Fauzia Batool/Kanwal Baloch\n*[[Osman Khalid Butt]] as Shehreyar (Kanwal's love interest)\n*[[Khalid Malik]] as Rehaan (Kanwal's best friend)\n*[[Ali Kazmi]] as Abid (Fauzia's husband) \n*[[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Raheem (Fauzia's elder brother)\n*[[Irfan Khoosat]] as Fauzia's father\n*[[Saba Faisal (actress)|Saba Faisal]] as Fauzia's mother\n*[[Nimra Khan]] as Munni Fauzia's younger sister \n*[[Nadia Afgan]] as Asma (Fauzia's sister-in-law)\n*[[Seemi Raheel]] as Abid's mother\n*Syed Tabrez Ali Shah as Munna Fauzia's younger brother\n*Syed Babrik Shah\n*[[Laila Zuberi]] as Shehreyar's mother\n*[[Mani (actor)|Mani]]\n*Tahir Jatoi\n*Sophia Mirza\n*Tahir Latif Saqi\n*Nishoo\n*Farhana Maqsood as Abid's second wife\n*Farah Tufail\n*Muskan Jay as Abid's sister\n*Rabia Abid Ali (Noreen)\n*Imran Ali Sheikh\n*Raja Matloob\n*Fahad Sherwani\n*Usman Mazhar\n*Ali Deswali\n*Amna Karim\n*Mahrukh Rizvi\n*Wahaj Khan\n*Salma Shaheen\n*Mehboob Sultan\n*Urooj Abbas\n*Anees Alam\n*Omair Ali Bhutto\n*Abdullah Malik\n*Meerub Shahid\n*Muhammad Subhan\n*Sunaina Shehzad\n*Ali Saqi\n*Bahawal Tofeeq\n*Ibrahim Tariq \n*Munawar noor\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Yasir Hussain]] as [[Sohail Warraich]]\n* [[Yasir Nawaz]]\n* Ali Saqi \n* [[Hareem Farooq]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Goher Mumtaz]] as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* Nomi Ansari as a Pakistan Idol Judge\n* [[Hira Tareen]]\n* [[Naeem Tahir]]\n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Chaudhrani Ji\n* Ahmed Godil\n* Hasan Soomro\n* [[Farooq Rind]]\n* Amna Karim\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

The class was indigenously designed and built by [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works|CLW]] in 1970. The class was produced from 1970 until 1983. WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\n.Production of these locomotives started in 1970 with 20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with 21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. They have been used for regularly hauling freight only in a few locations (Arakkonam - Renigunta, Kirandul-Kottavalasa and other SER sections). Max. speed 110&nbsp;km/h.\n\nVariants include\n\n* WAM-4P D (dual brakes), WAM-4P R (??),\n* WAM-4P DB 6P, WAM-4 6P DB HS, and WAM-4 6P D (these are for superfast trains), \n* WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P (some superfasts, passengers), and WAM-4P DB 4P (generally for stopping passengers). \n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.Now, most of these are used exclusively for passenger traffic.\n\n<br />\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n==Loco Sheds still holding WAM-4.==\n*'''Loco Shed Asansol-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Ghaziabad-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Ludhiana-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Jhansi-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Kanpur-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Tatanagar-''' 4\n*'''Loco Shed Bhilai-''' 4<br/ >In total 17 locomotives as of 01-03-2020 are there but 9 of them are overaged condemned and 8 of them are inferior in service.\n('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n<br/ >'''Source:''' http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/\n\n==Technical specifications<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>==\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|Alstom TAO 659 A1 (575&nbsp;kW, 750 V).

The [[asterisk]] indicates that the name was reconstructed by modern scholars, and the sign \"\u0161\" indicates the sound \"sh\". According to Ran Zadok, the name is of a non-[[Old Persian|Persic]] dialect origin.</ref>) (?- c. 478 BC) was a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] prince of the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]], son of king [[Darius I]]  (reign: 520-486 BC) and of his wife [[Atossa]], and full brother of king [[Xerxes I]] (reign: 486-465 BC). He was [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Bactria]] during his brother's reign, where he attempted to start a revolt in 478 BC.\n\n==Chief marshal==\n[[Image:Perserkriege Mykale.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Xerxes' invasion of Greece, showing the Persian march through Thrace (yellow) and the battle of Mycale (circled in blue).]]\nMasistes was one of the six chief marshals of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greek campaigns of Xerxes]] (480-479 BC). Along with general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], he commanded the army column that crossed [[Thrace]] along the coast;<ref>''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' VII 121</ref> however, he was almost completely absent during the course of the war, including the battles of [[battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\nHe reappeared close to the end of the war, when he fought in the [[Battle of Mycale]] (479 BC). According to Herodotus, the battle was just about to take place at sea, but the Persians decided to come ashore in [[Ionia]], [[Asia Minor]], and fight on land.<ref>''Histories'' IX 107</ref> The Greek and the Persian armies finally fought in Mycale, and the Persians were completely defeated. Commanders [[Tigranes (commander)|Tigranes]] and [[Mardontes]] died during the battle, but [[Artayntes]] and [[Itamithres]], as well as Masistes, managed to escape. According to Herodotus, on their way to [[Sardis]], where the king stayed, Masistes accused Artayntes of cowardice and blamed him of being \"worse than a woman\". In response, Artayntes unsheathed his sword and tried to kill Masistes, but was stopped by a [[Carian]] named [[Xenagoras of Halicarnassus]].<ref>Burn 1962, pp. 333, 336, 337, 351; Dandamaev 1989, p. 253.; Green 1998, p. 283.</ref>\n\nMasistes' family stayed near the battle, in Sardis, [[Lydia]], which was a common practice of the nobility of the Persian Empire.<ref>Brosius 1998, p. 90</ref> In Herodotus' ''Histories'', he comments that while Masistes was fighting, his brother, king Xerxes, seduced Masistes' wife (see below).<ref>Shrimpton 1997, p. 208.</ref>\n\n==Love affairs and Masistes' revolt==\n===The tale===\nMasistes is one of the main characters in a bloody episode in Herodotus' ''Histories'' (IX 108-110). Herodotus relates that, after his defeat in Greece, Xerxes fell in love with the wife of Masistes, but failed in all attempts to win her favour. In order to be closer to his sister-in-law, Xerxes married his son [[Darius (son of Xerxes I)|Darius]] to his niece [[Artaynte]], a daughter of Masistes. The wedding was celebrated in Sardis, but when the court returned to [[Susa]], Xerxes decided that he wanted the daughter rather than the mother, and Artaynte became his lover. One day, Xerxes visited Artaynte wearing a robe that had been woven by queen [[Amestris]].  He offered Artaynte to grant her whatever wish she desired. She chose the robe, and when she wore it in public, the affair was discovered.\n\nWhen Amestris heard the news she sought revenge, not from Artaynte, strangely enough, but from her mother, the wife of Masistes. It was customary in Persia that on the king's birthday he had to grant all the wishes he was asked, so Amestris waited until that date to ask Xerxes to have Masistes' wife killed. Under Amestris' orders, Masistes' wife was tortured and mutilated: her breasts, nose, ears, lips and tongue were cut out. In the meantime, Xerxes offered Masistes the hand of one of his daughters. Masistes refused, and when he saw his mutilated wife he fled to Bactria to start a revolt; however, he was intercepted on his way by troops sent by the king, and put to death along with his followers and his three sons.\n\n===Historical background===\nThe tale refers to an ill-fated attempt of Masistes to lead a revolt against his brother Xerxes. Although the exact date is unknown, it could not have happened too long after the battle of Mycale (479 BC), perhaps in 478 BC.<ref>Lendering, a.</ref>\n\nIt was originally considered that Xerxes, affected by his defeats in Greece, became involved in [[harem]] intrigues that would cause turmoil in the court and eventually result in the decadence and ruin of the Empire.<ref>Olmstead 1959 [1948], pp. 266-267.</ref> This view is widely criticised by more modern authors.<ref>Such as, Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983], pp. 28-30; Dandamaev 1989, p. 232; Brosius 1998, pp. 8-9; Wieseh\u00f6fer 2006 [2001], pp. 52-53.</ref> Many of the episode's themes appear in many legendary tales of Persian origin - the plot is the same, only the names of the characters are changed. Thus, although the tale is based on Persian oral accounts of Masistes' revolt, it is impossible to consider it as a historical fact and to derive literal conclusions from it.<ref>Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983], pp. 28-30; Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2002.</ref>\n\nRelating to this, it has been argued that the royal [[robe]] (which Amestris wove for Xerxes in the story) was not just a piece of clothing but a symbol of the Persian monarchy.<ref>Eddy 1961, p. 93; Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983] pp. 28-30.</ref> According to this reasoning, and within the symbolic context of Persian culture of this period, when Artaynte asked Xerxes for his robe she was actually asking for the throne, although not for her, as she was married to the heir, prince Darius, but perhaps for her father Masistes. This could explain why Amestris punished Masistes' wife instead of her daughter Artaynte.

Along with general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], he commanded the army column that crossed [[Thrace]] along the coast;<ref>''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' VII 121</ref> however, he was almost completely absent during the course of the war, including the battles of [[battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\nHe reappeared close to the end of the war, when he fought in the [[Battle of Mycale]] (479 BC). According to Herodotus, the battle was just about to take place at sea, but the Persians decided to come ashore in [[Ionia]], [[Asia Minor]], and fight on land.<ref>''Histories'' IX 107</ref> The Greek and the Persian armies finally fought in Mycale, and the Persians were completely defeated. Commanders [[Tigranes (commander)|Tigranes]] and [[Mardontes]] died during the battle, but [[Artayntes]] and [[Itamithres]], as well as Masistes, managed to escape. According to Herodotus, on their way to [[Sardis]], where the king stayed, Masistes accused Artayntes of cowardice and blamed him of being \"worse than a woman\". In response, Artayntes unsheathed his sword and tried to kill Masistes, but was stopped by a [[Carian]] named [[Xenagoras of Halicarnassus]].<ref>Burn 1962, pp. 333, 336, 337, 351; Dandamaev 1989, p. 253.; Green 1998, p. 283.</ref>\n\nMasistes' family stayed near the battle, in Sardis, [[Lydia]], which was a common practice of the nobility of the Persian Empire.<ref>Brosius 1998, p. 90</ref> In Herodotus' ''Histories'', he comments that while Masistes was fighting, his brother, king Xerxes, seduced Masistes' wife (see below).<ref>Shrimpton 1997, p. 208.</ref>\n\n==Love affairs and Masistes' revolt==\n===The tale===\nMasistes is one of the main characters in a bloody episode in Herodotus' ''Histories'' (IX 108-110). Herodotus relates that, after his defeat in Greece, Xerxes fell in love with the wife of Masistes, but failed in all attempts to win her favour. In order to be closer to his sister-in-law, Xerxes married his son [[Darius (son of Xerxes I)|Darius]] to his niece [[Artaynte]], a daughter of Masistes. The wedding was celebrated in Sardis, but when the court returned to [[Susa]], Xerxes decided that he wanted the daughter rather than the mother, and Artaynte became his lover. One day, Xerxes visited Artaynte wearing a robe that had been woven by queen [[Amestris]].  He offered Artaynte to grant her whatever wish she desired. She chose the robe, and when she wore it in public, the affair was discovered.\n\nWhen Amestris heard the news she sought revenge, not from Artaynte, strangely enough, but from her mother, the wife of Masistes. It was customary in Persia that on the king's birthday he had to grant all the wishes he was asked, so Amestris waited until that date to ask Xerxes to have Masistes' wife killed. Under Amestris' orders, Masistes' wife was tortured and mutilated: her breasts, nose, ears, lips and tongue were cut out. In the meantime, Xerxes offered Masistes the hand of one of his daughters. Masistes refused, and when he saw his mutilated wife he fled to Bactria to start a revolt; however, he was intercepted on his way by troops sent by the king, and put to death along with his followers and his three sons.\n\n===Historical background===\nThe tale refers to an ill-fated attempt of Masistes to lead a revolt against his brother Xerxes. Although the exact date is unknown, it could not have happened too long after the battle of Mycale (479 BC), perhaps in 478 BC.<ref>Lendering, a.</ref>\n\nIt was originally considered that Xerxes, affected by his defeats in Greece, became involved in [[harem]] intrigues that would cause turmoil in the court and eventually result in the decadence and ruin of the Empire.<ref>Olmstead 1959 [1948], pp. 266-267.</ref> This view is widely criticised by more modern authors.<ref>Such as, Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983], pp. 28-30; Dandamaev 1989, p. 232; Brosius 1998, pp. 8-9; Wieseh\u00f6fer 2006 [2001], pp. 52-53.</ref> Many of the episode's themes appear in many legendary tales of Persian origin - the plot is the same, only the names of the characters are changed. Thus, although the tale is based on Persian oral accounts of Masistes' revolt, it is impossible to consider it as a historical fact and to derive literal conclusions from it.<ref>Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983], pp. 28-30; Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2002.</ref>\n\nRelating to this, it has been argued that the royal [[robe]] (which Amestris wove for Xerxes in the story) was not just a piece of clothing but a symbol of the Persian monarchy.<ref>Eddy 1961, p. 93; Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983] pp. 28-30.</ref> According to this reasoning, and within the symbolic context of Persian culture of this period, when Artaynte asked Xerxes for his robe she was actually asking for the throne, although not for her, as she was married to the heir, prince Darius, but perhaps for her father Masistes. This could explain why Amestris punished Masistes' wife instead of her daughter Artaynte. It has also been noted that the punishment that Masistes' wife received was usually reserved for rebels.<ref>Sancisi-Weerdenburg 2005 [1983], p. 29. For example, in the [[Behistun Inscription]]: \"Thereupon that Phraortes fled thence with a few horseman to a district in [[Medes|Media]] called Rhagae. Then I sent an army in pursuit. Phraortes was taken and brought unto me. I cut off his nose, his ears, and his tongue...\" (quoted from Kent's translation [https://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun03.html])</ref>\n\nOther legendary Persian episodes share the theme of the royal robe, amongst these:\n*[[Cyrus the Great]] receives the royal [[Medes|Mede]] robe when he marries the daughter of Mede king [[Astyages]] ([[Xenophon]], ''Cyropaedia'' VIII 5 18).\n*[[Cyrus the Younger]] is just about to kill his brother, king [[Artaxerxes II]], but stops when he sees him dressing himself with the royal robe ([[Plutarch]], ''Artoxerxes'' III 1-4).\n*During a hunting expedition, nobleman [[Tiribazus]] wears the royal robe of king Artaxerxes II, causing disgust amongst his courtiers, as it is forbidden ([[Plutarch]], ''Artoxerxes'' V 2).<ref>Eddy 1961, p. 93.</ref>\n\n==Masistes and ''mathishta''==\nIt has been noted that the name ''Masistes'' (which the Greek sources give) is related to the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian[[ title ''mathishta'' (''ma\u03b8i\u0161ta'', \"the greatest\", \"the highest\", \"the longest\"; \"chief [of the troop]\"; as a title, \"the greatest after the king\", \"the second after the king\") given to the royal heir designated by the king.<ref>Lendering b, with previous bibliography; Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez 2005, pp. 8-9.</ref> The problem lies in that the heir designated by Darius I is Xerxes, not Masistes, although the succession was not free of conflict.

Inventions that are credited to the [[ancient Greeks]] include the gear, screw, rotary mills, [[bronze]] casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult, the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys, and a chart to find [[prime numbers]]. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. However, peaceful uses are shown by their early development of the [[watermill]], a device which pointed to further exploitation on a large scale under the Romans. They developed [[surveying]] and [[mathematics]] to an advanced state, and many of their technical advances were published by philosophers, like [[Archimedes]] and [[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]].\n\n==Water technology==\nSome fields that were encompassed in the area of water resources (mainly for urban use) included groundwater exploitation, construction of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s for water supply, storm water and wastewater sewerage systems, flood protection and drainage, construction and use of [[fountain]]s, baths and other sanitary and purgatory facilities, and even recreational uses of water.<ref>{{cite book |last=Angelfish |first=A.

It involved mining the ores in underground galleries, washing it and [[smelting]] it to produce the metal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site, which used rainwater held in [[cistern]]s and collected during the winter months. Mining also helped to create currency by the conversion of the metal into [[coin]]age. Greek mines had tunnels that were as deep as 330 feet and were worked by slaves using picks and iron hammers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Technology in Ancient Greece|last=Samuels|first=Charlie|publisher=Gareth Stevens Publishing LLLP|year=2013|isbn=9781433996337|location=New York|pages=36}}</ref> The extracted ore were lifted by small skips hauled by a rope that was sometimes guided by a wheel placed against the rim of the mine shaft.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Studies in Ancient Technology, Volume 4|last=Forbes|first=Robert|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1966|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=145}}</ref>\n\n==Inventions==\nThe Greeks extensively developed technology in several fields. To achieve this feat they used innovative inventions and techniques and perfected foreign ideas. Several of these inventions are found in the following list. To these must be added, as a special mention, the sophisticated [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel]] that serve as aqueduct built in the 6th century B.C. by the engineer [[Eupalinos]] from [[Megara]], which was the first engineer project of its kind and the longest tunnel of its time, which is still in good condition today, being an achievement that represented a new dimension of the skills of the Greeks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1px; border:1px solid #ccc;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\" \"\n! |Technology\n! |Date\n! |Description\n! class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|'''[[Archimedes' screw]]'''\n|c. 3rd century BC\n|This device, capable of lifting solid or liquid substances from a lower plane to a higher elevation, is traditionally attributed to the Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Oleson\n | first = John Peter\n | year = 2000\n | contribution = Water-Lifting\n | editor-last = Wikander\n | editor-first = \u00d6rjan\n | editor-link = \u00d6rjan Wikander\n | title = Handbook of Ancient Water Technology\n | series = Technology and Change in History\n | publication-place = Leiden\n | volume = 2\n | pages = 217\u2013302 (242\u2013251)\n | isbn = 90-04-11123-9\n}}</ref><ref>David Sacks (2005) [1995].

Inventions that are credited to the [[ancient Greeks]] include the gear, screw, rotary mills, [[bronze]] casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult, the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys, and a chart to find [[prime numbers]]. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. However, peaceful uses are shown by their early development of the [[watermill]], a device which pointed to further exploitation on a large scale under the Romans. They developed [[surveying]] and [[mathematics]] to an advanced state, and many of their technical advances were published by philosophers, like [[Archimedes]] and [[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]].\n\n==Water technology==\nSome fields that were encompassed in the area of water resources (mainly for urban use) included groundwater exploitation, construction of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s for water supply, storm water and wastewater sewerage systems, flood protection and drainage, construction and use of [[fountain]]s, baths and other sanitary and purgatory facilities, and even recreational uses of water.<ref>{{cite book |last=Angelfish |first=A.

It involved mining the ores in underground galleries, washing it and [[smelting]] it to produce the metal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site, which used rainwater held in [[cistern]]s and collected during the winter months. Mining also helped to create currency by the conversion of the metal into [[coin]]age.

To achieve this feat they used innovative inventions and techniques and perfected foreign ideas. Several of these inventions are found in the following list. To these must be added, as a special mention, the sophisticated [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel]] that serve as aqueduct built in the 6th century B.C. by the engineer [[Eupalinos]] from [[Megara]], which was the first engineer project of its kind and the longest tunnel of its time, which is still in good condition today, being an achievement that represented a new dimension of the skills of the Greeks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1px; border:1px solid #ccc;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\" \"\n! |Technology\n! |Date\n! |Description\n! class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|'''[[Archimedes' screw]]'''\n|c. 3rd century BC\n|This device, capable of lifting solid or liquid substances from a lower plane to a higher elevation, is traditionally attributed to the Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Oleson\n | first = John Peter\n | year = 2000\n | contribution = Water-Lifting\n | editor-last = Wikander\n | editor-first = \u00d6rjan\n | editor-link = \u00d6rjan Wikander\n | title = Handbook of Ancient Water Technology\n | series = Technology and Change in History\n | publication-place = Leiden\n | volume = 2\n | pages = 217\u2013302 (242\u2013251)\n | isbn = 90-04-11123-9\n}}</ref><ref>David Sacks (2005) [1995].
