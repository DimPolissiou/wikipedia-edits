He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&nbsp; x&nbsp;18&nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&nbsp;ft square.<ref name=Guillermo13>Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab. OPRR found that the lab's animal care failed in significant ways, and concluded that it was grossly unsanitary.<ref name=Science11dec1981/> Based on the OPRR investigation, NIH suspended the remaining funding for the experiments, over $200,000, because of violations of its animal care guidelines.<ref name=Boffey>Boffey, Philip M.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>Sideris, Lisa; McCarthy, Charles; and Smith, David H. 1999 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml \"Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics\"], ''ILAR Journal'', volume 40, issue 1.</ref> They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], still under the care and control of the NIH.<ref>''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.</ref> Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.<ref name=Barnard>Barnard ND et al.

He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&nbsp; x&nbsp;18&nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&nbsp;ft square.<ref name=Guillermo13>Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>Sideris, Lisa; McCarthy, Charles; and Smith, David H.

Under anesthesia, electrodes were placed in his brain and hundreds of recordings taken. The ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' said it revealed an \"unprecedented degree of reorganization of the sensory cortex. An 8&ndash;10-millimeter-wide area that would normally receive input from the hand was found to have completely filled in with input from the face.\" Brainmapping studies were conducted on the remaining monkeys on July 6, 1990, three days after PETA's application for custody was rejected.

The other premier towns were Naga, Quipayo and Nabua. The Spaniards who first came to this place asked the men who were splitting bamboos about the name of the place, and since they did not understand the language, they thought that they were being asked about the name of the bamboo, and so they got the answer \"Bu-la\". And so Bula became the name of the town.\n\nBula is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Pili and Ocampo, on the east by the municipality of Baao, on the southeast by the Municipality of Nabua, on the south it is bounded by the Municipality of Balataan, on the southwest by Ragay Gulf, and on the west by the Municipality of Minalabac.

Bula was established together with Quipayo, Naga and Nabua. However, it was only in 1578 when the natives where Christianized, so the National Historical Commission dates back our history to 1578. From this historical fact, Bula, whose chosen Saint is St. Mary Magdalene celebrates its fiesta every 22nd day of July, which is the birthdate of the Saint.\n\n==Language==\nMajority of the people speak the Bula-Pili variant, a lowland dialect (sinaran\u0259w) of [[Ri\u014bkon\u0101da Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]] language, also known as Ri\u014bkon\u0101da.

The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a [[giant order]] of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two {{convert|5.55|m}} statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]].<ref name=Pinto/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/StPaulStatue/StPaulStatue.htm|title=St. Peter's Square \u2013 Statue of St. Paul |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is [[cruciform]] in shape, with an elongated [[nave]] in the [[Latin cross]] form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a [[narthex]], or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the [[Holy Door]], only opened during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilees]].<ref name=Pinto/>\n\nThe interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches.<ref name=\"cathency\"/> One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building.

Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\n\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''. The central feature is a [[baldachin]], or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic ''Chair of Saint Peter''.\n\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world.

For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615.

The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"''petra''\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. ([[s:Bible (King James)/John#1:42|John 1:42]], and see [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]])\n\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his [[martyrdom]] there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to [[Origen]], Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles |website=New Advent |date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=JL-M/>  The obelisk now stands in [[St. Peter's Square]] and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death.

The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed over this site.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe area now covered by the [[Vatican City]] had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials, because for many years after the burial of [[Saint Peter]] many Christians chose to be buried near Peter.\n\nIn 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the 9th century.

Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance.

It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding, or at least making radical changes was [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1447\u201355). He commissioned work on the old building from [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/>  He had, however, ordered the demolition of the [[Colosseum]] and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/><ref>Quarrying of stone for the Colosseum had, in turn, been paid for with treasure looted at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] and destruction of the temple by the emperor [[Vespasian]]'s general (and the future emperor) [[Titus]] in 70 AD., Claridge, Amanda (1998).

Some walls for the choir had also been built.<ref>{{Harvnb|Betts|1993|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Julius II]] planned far more for St Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair or modification.

A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521), [[Pope Hadrian VI|Hadrian VI]] (1522\u20131523). [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534), [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), [[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), [[Pope Marcellus II|Marcellus II]] (1555), [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555\u20131559), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565), [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] (saint) (1565\u20131572), [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] (1572\u20131585), [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] (1585\u20131590), [[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]] (1590), [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]] (1590\u20131591), [[Pope Innocent IX|Innocent IX]] (1591), [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), [[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]] (1605), [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621), [[Pope Gregory XV|Gregory XV]] (1621\u20131623), [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623\u20131644) and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]] (1644\u20131655).\n\n===Financing with indulgences===\nOne method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of [[indulgences]] in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was [[Albrecht of Mainz|Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg]], who had to clear debts owed to the [[Roman Curia]] by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preacher [[Johann Tetzel]], whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.<ref>\"[[Johann Tetzel]]\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007: \"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\"</ref>\n\nA German [[Augustinian]] priest, [[Martin Luther]], wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as ''[[The 95 Theses]]''.<ref>Hillerbrand, Hans J. \"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007.</ref> This became a factor in starting the [[protestant reformation|Reformation]], the birth of [[Protestantism]].\n\n==Architecture==\n===Successive plans===\n[[File:SaintPierre.svg|thumb|upright|Bramante's plan|alt=This is plan 1 of 3.

It was the design of [[Donato Bramante]] that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous [[Greek Cross]] with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].<ref name=BF/> The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a [[Roof lantern|lantern]] with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of [[Florence Cathedral]] designed for Brunelleschi's dome by [[Michelozzo]].<ref name=Hartt/>\n\nBramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal [[chancel]], nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.<ref>Bramante's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] and [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo]], who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year).

His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\">Sangallo's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nOn 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldscheider|1996}}</ref> He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, [[Giulio Romano]] and the refusal of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] to leave [[Venice]]. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.<ref name=JL-M>{{Harvnb|Lees-Milne|1967}}</ref>\n\n===Michelangelo's contribution===\n[[Michelangelo]] took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] form, like the iconic [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, or of a [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].\n\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"<ref name=Gardner>{{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005}}</ref>\n\nAs it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by [[Carlo Maderno]]. It is the [[chancel]] end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the [[Vatican State]] and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections.<ref>Michelangelo's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref> Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small [[vestry]] or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a [[giant order]] of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface. Above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.<ref name=Mignacca>Eneide Mignacca, ''Michelangelo and the architecture of St. Peter's Basilica'', lecture, Sydney University, (1982)</ref>\n\n===Dome: successive and final designs===\n[[File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzf).jpg|thumb|upright|Bramante's dome|alt= Engraved image in two parts.

The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply [[coffering|coffered]] which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening {{convert|8|m|ft}} across which provides light to the interior.<ref name=BF/>\n\nBramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in [[Tufa]] [[Concrete]] for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a [[drum (architecture)|drum]] raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a [[peristyle]].\n\nIn the case of [[Florence Cathedral]], the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] made its construction feasible.<ref>The dome of Florence Cathedral is depicted in a fresco at [[Santa Maria Novella]] that pre-dates its building by about 100 years.</ref> Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.<ref name=Hartt>{{Harvnb|Hartt|2006}}</ref>\n\nSangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a [[peristyle]] and surmounted by a spire of conic form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\"/> According to [[James Lees-Milne]] the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}<!---Leave this.

The fa\u00e7ade is wide and has a row of huge columns rising from the basement to support the cornice. The ribbed, ovoid dome is surmounted by a lantern topped with ball and cross. Its drum is framed by two very much smaller domes.]]\n[[Michelangelo]] redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of [[Florence]], is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of {{convert|15|m|ft}} high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a [[Sphere|hemispherical]] [[dome]], such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each {{convert|18|m|ft}} across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] with [[Giorgio Vasari]] appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed [[Giacomo della Porta]] who was to be assisted by [[Domenico Fontana]]. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Caradosso Foppa, View of Saint Peter's (reverse), 1506, NGA 44669.jpg|thumb|upright|1506 medal by [[Cristoforo Foppa]] depicting Bramante's design, including the four flanking smaller domes<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 641] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 }}</ref>]]\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du P\u00e9rac who claimed that they were the master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways. The major change restored an earlier design, in which the outer dome appears to rise above, rather than rest directly on the base.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/663 663] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/663 }}</ref> Most of the other changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion's masks over the swags on the drum in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of [[finial]]s around the spire at the top of the lantern, as proposed by Sangallo.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nA drawing by Michelangelo indicates that his early intentions were towards an ovoid dome, rather than a hemispherical one.<ref name=Gardner/>  In an engraving in [[Galasso Alghisi]]' treatise (1563), the dome may be represented as ovoid, but the perspective is ambiguous.<ref>*[https://books.google.com/books?id=qP5PAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Alghisi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=quiyUPqrHeffyQGW_IE4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw  ''Galassi Alghisii Carpens., apud Alphonsum II.

The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Elevation Showing the Exterior of Saint Peter's Basilica from the South as Conceived by Michelagelo (Published in 1569) MET DT203424.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The engraving by Stefan du P\u00e9rac was published in 1569, five years after the death of Michelangelo |alt=This engraving shows the chancel end of the building much as it was built, except that the dome in this picture is completely semi-circular, not ovoid]]\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo]&nbsp;... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nIt is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome ''must'' appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections.<ref name=Mignacca/> If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the [[Classicism]] of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the Baroque]].<ref name=Mignacca/>\n\n====Completion====\n[[File:Dome of Saint Peter's Basilica (Interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The dome was brought to completion by Giacomo della Porta and Fontana.|alt= Photo looking up at the dome's interior from below.

His successor, [[Gregory XIV]], saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, [[Clement VIII]], had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the [[True Cross]] and a relic of [[St. Andrew]] and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting. As many as ten chains have been installed at various times, the earliest possibly planned by Michelangelo himself as a precaution, as Brunelleschi did at Florence Cathedral.\n\nAround the inside of the dome is written, in letters {{convert|1.4|m|ft}} high:\n\n{{quote|{{font|{{lang|la|TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM.

He was a nephew of [[Domenico Fontana]] and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The ''Fabbrica'' or building [[committee]], a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the [[Curia]] who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the [[Counter-Reformation]] which increasingly associated a [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] plan with paganism and saw the [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] as truly symbolic of Christianity.<ref name=JL-M/> The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"<ref name=\"Pile\">{{Harvnb|Pile|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, [[Vestry|vestries]] and [[Sacristy|sacristies]] had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a [[nave]] that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the [[facade]] were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the [[stucco]] decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Maderno's facade====\n[[File:0 Basilique Saint-Pierre - Rome (2).JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Maderno's fa\u00e7ade, with the statues of Saint Peter (left) and Saint Paul (right) flanking the entrance stairs|alt=Ornate building in the early morning with a giant order of columns beneath a Latin inscription, fourteen statues on the roofline, and large dome on top.]]\nThe facade designed by Maderno, is {{convert|114.69|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|45.55|m|ft}} high and is built of [[travertine]] stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall [[Attic style|attic]] surmounted by thirteen statues: [[Christ]] flanked by eleven of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] (except [[Saint Peter]], whose statue is left of the stairs) and [[John the Baptist]].\n<ref>[[:File:San Pietro in Vaticano 001.JPG|Another view of the fa\u00e7ade statues]].

The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the [[attic]] story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:San Pietro in Vaticano 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The narthex|alt=Photo shows view of vestibule with three huge doorways leading to the church's interior.

This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of [[Charlemagne]] (18th century) by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] in the south end and ''[[The Vision of Constantine (Bernini)|The Vision of Constantine]]'' (1670) by [[Bernini]] in the north end.\n\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica.

The changes that Maderno made to the axis and width can be seen clearly in this picture.]]\nTo the single bay of [[Michelangelo]]'s Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient [[List of obelisks in Rome|Egyptian obelisk]] had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe nave has huge paired [[pilaster]]s, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building.<ref name=JL-M/><ref>The word \"stupendous\" is used by a number of writers trying to adequately describe the enormity of the interior. These include James Lees-Milne and Banister Fletcher.</ref> The four [[cherub]]s who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two [[holy water]] basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller [[chapel]]s and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, [[Gilding|gilt]], [[sculpture]] and [[mosaic]]. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces. \n\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its [[Baluster|balustrade]] are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n===Influence on church architecture===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced [[church architecture]] in [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]. Within Rome, the huge domed church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of [[San Carlo ai Catinari]], [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]], and many others. [[Christopher Wren]]'s dome at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] ([[London]], [[England]]), the domes of [[Karlskirche]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]]), [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church]] ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]), and the [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]) all pay [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago]], [[St. Josaphat's Basilica]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh]] and [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] in [[Montreal]], which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. [[Post-Modernism]] has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]].\n\n==Bernini's furnishings==\n[[File:The Chair of Saint Peter adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|The apse with St. Peter's Cathedra supported by four Doctors of the Church|alt=Pews before the ornate, gold-leafed throne of St. Peter]]\n\n===Pope Urban VIII and Bernini===\nAs a young boy [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter [[Annibale Carracci]] and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]] and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the [[Baroque]] period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the [[baldachin]] (baldaquin, from Italian: ''baldacchino''), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and [[loggia]]s in the piers of the dome and the [[Chair of Saint Peter|chair of St. Peter]].<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\n====Baldacchino and niches====\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Baldachin}}\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|baldacchino]], a pavilion-like structure {{convert|28.74|m|ft}} tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the [[Ciborium (architecture)|''ciborium'']], of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the [[Sacrament]]<!-- -Caps needed in this sense- --> is laid for the [[Eucharist]] and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ''ciboria'' are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the [[baldachin]] or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted [[Solomonic columns|barley-sugar shape]] had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Jerusalem]] and donated by the [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]]. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\n[[File:Interiorvaticano8baldaquino.jpg|High altar|thumb|left|The altar with Bernini's baldacchino|alt= Photo shows the baldachin standing in the centre of the church, viewed looking towards the nave. There is an altar beneath it which has a red and gold frontal cloth decorated with large crosses.]]\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'' in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\nAs part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four [[Balcony|balconies]]. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the [[Holy Lance|spear of Longinus]], said to have pierced the side of Christ, the [[veil of Veronica]], with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the [[True Cross]] discovered in [[Jerusalem]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], and a relic of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only ''Saint Longinus'' is the work of Bernini.<ref name=JL-M/> (See below)\n\n====Bernini's Towers====\n[[File:Cathedrapetri+gloria.jpg|thumb|Bernini's Cathedra Petri and ''Gloria''|alt=The chair-shaped bronze reliquary which holds the throne of St Peter is much larger than a normal chair, is ornate in shape and decorated with relief sculpture and gold leaf. The \"Gloria\" which surrounds a round window is a sculpture of clouds and sun-rays, surrounded by angels, the whole lot being covered in gleaming gold leaf.]]\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\n\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\n\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n====Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament====\n{{Main article|Chair of Saint Peter}}\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called ''[[Cathedra Petri]]'' or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, [[Pope Alexander VII]] determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four [[Doctors of the Church]], Saints [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine]] representing the Latin Church and [[Athanasius]] and [[John Chrysostom]], the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow [[alabaster]], illuminating, at its centre, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, [[Andrea Sacchi]], had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.<ref name=\"JL-M\" /><ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nBernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament.<ref name=\"Basilica Info\">{{cite web|last=Kilby|first=Peter|title=St Peter's Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)|url=http://www.rome.info/vatican/st-peters-basilica/|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's [[Tempietto]], the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==St. Peter's Piazza==\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Square}}\n<!-- -NOTE:This section uses the well-known Italian word \"piazza\" because the English translation to \"square\" is a misnomer.- -->\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro (notte).jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's Basilica and the piazza at night|alt=Behind a large monolithic obelisk, the facade of St. Peter's Basilica, lit by floodlights, rising majestically against the night sky]]\nTo the east of the basilica is the ''Piazza di San Pietro'', ([[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]]). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the [[Baroque]] inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian [[obelisk]] which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade.<ref>The obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis by an unknown pharaoh of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (c. 2494 BC \u2013 2345 BC).</ref> The [[obelisk]], known as \"The Witness\", at {{convert|25.31|m|ft}} and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of {{convert|40|m|ft}}, is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the [[Circus of Nero]] in 37&nbsp;AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the [[crucifixion]] of Saint Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/Obelisk/Obelisk.htm|title=St. Peter's, the Obelisk |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> Its removal to its present location by order of [[Pope Sixtus V]] and engineered by [[Domenico Fontana]] on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of [[Sanremo]], and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Fountain of Carlo Maderno night.jpg|thumb|One of the two fountains which form the axis of the piazza.|alt=View of one fountain which rises in two tiers from a sculptured pool. The fountain is playing and the water is sparkling.]]\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large [[fountain]] designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] in [[Siena]]. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The [[trapezoid]] plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nBernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its centre. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an [[entablature]] of the simple [[Tuscan order|Tuscan Order]].\n\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".<ref name=Gardner/>  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the [[Via della Conciliazione]], built by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaties]], leads from the [[Tiber|River Tiber]] to the [[Town square|piazza]] and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a [[terminating vista]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nBernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\".<ref name=Gardner/> Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility&nbsp;... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"<ref name=BF/>\n[[File:St Peter's Square, Vatican City - April 2007.jpg|upright=2.25|thumb|centre|View of Rome from the Dome of St. Peter's Basilica|alt=At the front of the view are the backs of thirteen large statues that stand in along the edge of the fa\u00e7ade. Beyond them can be seen the piazza which is in three parts. The nearest appears square, while the second widens into an oval surrounded on each side by the huge grey columns on the colonnade, and with the obelisk at its centre. Beyond that is a further square surrounded by pale pink buildings. A wide street leads from the square, at the end of which can be seen the river, a bridge and castle.]]\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows [[European mean time]]. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the roman clock is the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City]] since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"  \n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]] that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell '''Rota''' dates from 1288 and the bourdon called '''Campanone''' is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Bell#\n!Name\n!Mass \n!Casted\n|-\n|1\n|Campanella\n|260 kg\n|1825\n|-\n|2\n|Ave Maria \n|280 kg\n|1932\n|-\n|3\n|Predica\n|850 kg\n|1893\n|-\n|4\n|Rota\n|2 t\n|1288\n|-\n|5\n|Campanoncino (Mezzana, Benedittina)\n|4 t\n|1725\n|-\n|6\n|Campanone\n|9 t\n|1785\n|}\n\n==Treasures==\n[[File:Crypt air vent.jpg|thumb|[[Air vent]]s for the crypt in St. Peter's Basilica|alt=White and orange marble rings a circular, decorated bronze vent]]\n\n===Tombs and relics===\n{{Main article|List of papal tombs}}\nThere are over 100 [[tomb]]s within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto II]], and the composer [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]. Exiled Catholic British royalty [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and his two sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by [[Pope Clement XI]]. Also buried here are [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]], wife of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated her throne in order to convert to [[Catholicism]], and [[Countess]] [[Matilda of Tuscany]], supporter of the Papacy during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. The most recent interment was [[Pope John Paul II]], on 8 April 2005. Beneath, near the [[crypt]], is the recently discovered vaulted 4th-century \"[[Tomb of the Julii]]\". (See below for some descriptions of tombs).\n\n===Artworks===\n====Towers and narthex====\n* In the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\n* One of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by [[Giotto]] (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church.<ref name=Pinto/> The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\n* At each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north [[Constantine the Great]] by Bernini (1670) and to the south [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] (18th century).<ref name=Pinto/>\n* Of the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by [[Antonio di Pietro Averlino|Antonio Averulino]] (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the ''[[Door of the Dead in St. Peter's Basilica|Door of the Dead]]'', was designed by 20th-century sculptor [[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]] and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\n* The northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee year]] by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by [[Vico Consorti]] in 1950 and cast in [[Florence]] by the [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]].

One foot of the statue is largely worn away by [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] kissing it for centuries.\n* The sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican [[Grotto]]es (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by [[Canova]] of [[Pope Pius VI]], who was captured and mistreated by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\n* In the Confessio is the ''Niche of the Pallium'' (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\n* The High [[Altar]] is surmounted by Bernini's [[baldachin]]. (See above)\n* Set in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] holding the [[True Cross]] and the [[Nail (relic)|Holy Nails]], by [[Andrea Bolgi]]; [[Saint Longinus]] holding the [[Holy Lance|spear that pierced the side of Jesus]], by Bernini (1639); [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] with the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], by [[Francois Duquesnoy]] and [[Saint Veronica]] holding her [[Veil of Veronica|veil with the image of Jesus' face]], by [[Francesco Mochi]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"150px\">\nFile:Saint Helena.jpg|alt= A marble statue showing a matronly woman in a sweeping cloak supporting a cross which stands beside her and presenting a set of nails to the viewer with her left hand|''Saint Helena''<br>by Andrea Bolgi\nFile:Saint Longinus.jpg|alt= This statue shows a Roman soldier, with a cloak furling around him, gazing upward while he supports a long spear with his right hand and throws out his other hand in amazement.|''Saint Longinus''<br>by Bernini\nFile:Saint Andreas.jpg|alt= This statue shows an elderly man, bare-chested, and draped, looking up despairingly as he supports a large cross, arranged diagonally.|''Saint Andrew''<br>by Francois Duquesnoy\nFile:Saint veronica.jpg|alt= This statue shows the saint as a young woman, who, with a sweeping dramatic gesture, displays a cloth on which there is an image of the face of Jesus.|''Saint Veronica''<br>by Francesco Mochi\n</gallery>\n\n====North aisle====\n* In the first chapel of the north aisle is [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''.<ref>The statue was damaged in 1972 by Lazlo Toft, a Hungarian-Australian, who considered that the veneration shown to the statue was idolatrous. The damage was repaired and the statue subsequently placed behind glass.</ref>\n* On the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\n* The second chapel, dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian]], contains the statues of popes [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of [[Pope Innocent XI]] but his remains were moved to the ''Altar of the Transfiguration'' on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of [[Pope John Paul II]]. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\n* The large chapel on the right aisle is the ''Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament'' which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' at [[San Pietro in Montorio]] supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the [[Holy Trinity]] by [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n* Near the altar of ''Our Lady of Succour'' are the monuments of popes [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] by [[Camillo Rusconi]] (1723) and [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]].\n* At the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of [[Saint Petronilla]] and with an altarpiece ''The Burial of St Petronilla'' by [[Guercino]] (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n====South aisle====\n* The first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and designed by [[Carlo Fontana]], (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font, which was previously located in the opposite chapel, is the red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] of Probus, the 4th-century [[Prefect]] of Rome. The lid came from a different [[sarcophagus]], which had once held the remains of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] and in removing it from the Vatican Grotto where it had been stored, the workmen broke it into ten pieces. Fontana restored it expertly and surmounted it with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\".\n* Against the first pier of the aisle is the [[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]], James and his sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]], known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" and [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry, Cardinal and Duke of York]]. The tomb is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] design by [[Canova]] unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]].\n* The second chapel is that of the ''Presentation of the Virgin'' and contains the memorials of [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].\n* Against the piers are the tombs of [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]].\n* The large chapel off the south aisle is the ''Choir Chapel'' which contains the altar of the ''[[Immaculate Conception]]''.\n* At the entrance to the [[Sacristy]] is the tomb of [[Pope Pius VIII]]\n* The south transept contains the altars of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint Joseph]] and the ''Crucifixion of [[Saint Peter]]''.\n* The tomb of Fabio Chigi, [[Pope Alexander VII]], towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the [[Baroque]] Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] and [[Truth]]. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant [[England]].

[[Saint Peter's tomb]] is supposedly directly below the [[high altar]] of the basilica. For this reason, many [[pope]]s have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period. A church has stood on this site since the time of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]]. [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] dates from the 4th century AD.

The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a [[giant order]] of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two {{convert|5.55|m}} statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]].<ref name=Pinto/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/StPaulStatue/StPaulStatue.htm|title=St. Peter's Square \u2013 Statue of St. Paul |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is [[cruciform]] in shape, with an elongated [[nave]] in the [[Latin cross]] form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a [[narthex]], or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the [[Holy Door]], only opened during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilees]].<ref name=Pinto/>\n\nThe interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches.<ref name=\"cathency\"/> One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building.

The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome.

Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\n\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''. The central feature is a [[baldachin]], or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic ''Chair of Saint Peter''.\n\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world.

The rank of major basilica confers on St. Peter's Basilica precedence before all [[minor basilica]]s worldwide.

Although the New Testament does not mention St. Peter's martyrdom in Rome, tradition, based on the writings of the [[Fathers of the Church]],{{clarify|Clement of Rome was the only one close enough. This sounds rather deliberately vague. We have Clement's writing and can identify him.

For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615. At length, on 18 November 1626 [[Pope Urban VIII]] solemnly dedicated the Basilica.<ref name=\"cathency\"/>\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica is neither the [[Pope]]'s official seat nor first in rank among the [[Major basilica|Major Basilicas]] of Rome.

However, St. Peter's is certainly the Pope's principal church in terms of use because most Papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size, proximity to the Papal residence, and location within the Vatican City proper. The \"[[Chair of Saint Peter]]\", or [[cathedra]], an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by St. Peter himself, but which was a gift from [[Charles the Bald]] and used by many popes, symbolizes the continuing line of [[apostolic succession]] from St. Peter to the reigning Pope.

The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"''petra''\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. ([[s:Bible (King James)/John#1:42|John 1:42]], and see [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]])\n\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his [[martyrdom]] there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to [[Origen]], Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles |website=New Advent |date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=JL-M/>  The obelisk now stands in [[St. Peter's Square]] and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death.

The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed over this site.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe area now covered by the [[Vatican City]] had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials, because for many years after the burial of [[Saint Peter]] many Christians chose to be buried near Peter.\n\nIn 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the 9th century. The excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels, from [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1594)  to [[Callixtus II]] (1123) and [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (590\u2013604), built over an [[aedicula]] containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations, tinted with the precious [[murex]] purple. Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance.

He commissioned work on the old building from [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old.

A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was [[Albrecht of Mainz|Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg]], who had to clear debts owed to the [[Roman Curia]] by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preacher [[Johann Tetzel]], whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.<ref>\"[[Johann Tetzel]]\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007: \"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\"</ref>\n\nA German [[Augustinian]] priest, [[Martin Luther]], wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as ''[[The 95 Theses]]''.<ref>Hillerbrand, Hans J. \"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007.</ref> This became a factor in starting the [[protestant reformation|Reformation]], the birth of [[Protestantism]].\n\n==Architecture==\n===Successive plans===\n[[File:SaintPierre.svg|thumb|upright|Bramante's plan|alt=This is plan 1 of 3.

This plan shows a return to the form of plan 1. but with all the various parts made bolder.]]\nPope Julius' scheme for the grandest building in Christendom<ref name=BF>{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1975}}</ref> was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence. It was the design of [[Donato Bramante]] that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous [[Greek Cross]] with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].<ref name=BF/> The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a [[Roof lantern|lantern]] with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of [[Florence Cathedral]] designed for Brunelleschi's dome by [[Michelozzo]].<ref name=Hartt/>\n\nBramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal [[chancel]], nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.<ref>Bramante's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] and [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo]], who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). [[Raphael]] was confirmed as architect of St. Peter's on 1 August, 1514.<ref>{{cite book |last=Golzio |first=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |date=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |pp=593\u201394}}</ref>The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.<ref>Raphael's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante.<ref>Peruzzi's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by [[Emperor Charles V]]. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.<ref name=BF/>\n\nAt this point [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa\u00e7ade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\">Sangallo's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nOn 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldscheider|1996}}</ref> He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, [[Giulio Romano]] and the refusal of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] to leave [[Venice]]. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.<ref name=JL-M>{{Harvnb|Lees-Milne|1967}}</ref>\n\n===Michelangelo's contribution===\n[[Michelangelo]] took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] form, like the iconic [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, or of a [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].\n\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"<ref name=Gardner>{{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005}}</ref>\n\nAs it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by [[Carlo Maderno]]. It is the [[chancel]] end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the [[Vatican State]] and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections.<ref>Michelangelo's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref> Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small [[vestry]] or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a [[giant order]] of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface. Above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.<ref name=Mignacca>Eneide Mignacca, ''Michelangelo and the architecture of St. Peter's Basilica'', lecture, Sydney University, (1982)</ref>\n\n===Dome: successive and final designs===\n[[File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzf).jpg|thumb|upright|Bramante's dome|alt= Engraved image in two parts.

It has a greater diameter by approximately {{convert|30|ft|m}} than Constantinople's [[Hagia Sophia]] church, completed in 537. It was to the domes of the Pantheon and Florence [[duomo]] that the architects of St. Peter's looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived, from the outset, as the greatest dome of [[Christendom]].\n\n====Bramante and Sangallo, 1506 and 1513====\n[[File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzg).jpg|thumb|left|alt= An engraved picture showing an immensely complex design for the fa\u00e7ade, with two ornate towers and a multitude of windows, pilasters and pediments, above which the dome rises looking like a three-tiered wedding cake.|Sangallo's design]]\n\nThe dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door. The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply [[coffering|coffered]] which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening {{convert|8|m|ft}} across which provides light to the interior.<ref name=BF/>\n\nBramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in [[Tufa]] [[Concrete]] for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a [[drum (architecture)|drum]] raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a [[peristyle]].\n\nIn the case of [[Florence Cathedral]], the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] made its construction feasible.<ref>The dome of Florence Cathedral is depicted in a fresco at [[Santa Maria Novella]] that pre-dates its building by about 100 years.</ref> Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.<ref name=Hartt>{{Harvnb|Hartt|2006}}</ref>\n\nSangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a [[peristyle]] and surmounted by a spire of conic form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\"/> According to [[James Lees-Milne]] the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}<!---Leave this.

Its drum is framed by two very much smaller domes.]]\n[[Michelangelo]] redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of [[Florence]], is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of {{convert|15|m|ft}} high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a [[Sphere|hemispherical]] [[dome]], such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each {{convert|18|m|ft}} across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] with [[Giorgio Vasari]] appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed [[Giacomo della Porta]] who was to be assisted by [[Domenico Fontana]]. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Caradosso Foppa, View of Saint Peter's (reverse), 1506, NGA 44669.jpg|thumb|upright|1506 medal by [[Cristoforo Foppa]] depicting Bramante's design, including the four flanking smaller domes<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 641] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 }}</ref>]]\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du P\u00e9rac who claimed that they were the master's final solution.

The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Elevation Showing the Exterior of Saint Peter's Basilica from the South as Conceived by Michelagelo (Published in 1569) MET DT203424.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The engraving by Stefan du P\u00e9rac was published in 1569, five years after the death of Michelangelo |alt=This engraving shows the chancel end of the building much as it was built, except that the dome in this picture is completely semi-circular, not ovoid]]\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo]&nbsp;... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nIt is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome ''must'' appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections.<ref name=Mignacca/> If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the [[Classicism]] of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the Baroque]].<ref name=Mignacca/>\n\n====Completion====\n[[File:Dome of Saint Peter's Basilica (Interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The dome was brought to completion by Giacomo della Porta and Fontana.|alt= Photo looking up at the dome's interior from below.

His successor, [[Gregory XIV]], saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, [[Clement VIII]], had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the [[True Cross]] and a relic of [[St. Andrew]] and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting.

He was a nephew of [[Domenico Fontana]] and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The ''Fabbrica'' or building [[committee]], a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the [[Curia]] who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the [[Counter-Reformation]] which increasingly associated a [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] plan with paganism and saw the [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] as truly symbolic of Christianity.<ref name=JL-M/> The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"<ref name=\"Pile\">{{Harvnb|Pile|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, [[Vestry|vestries]] and [[Sacristy|sacristies]] had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a [[nave]] that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the [[facade]] were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the [[stucco]] decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down.

The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the [[attic]] story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:San Pietro in Vaticano 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The narthex|alt=Photo shows view of vestibule with three huge doorways leading to the church's interior.

A group listens to a tour guide while one woman examines the doors.]]\n\n====Narthex and portals====\nBehind the fa\u00e7ade of St. Peter's stretches a long portico or \"[[narthex]]\" such as was occasionally found in Italian churches. This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of [[Charlemagne]] (18th century) by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] in the south end and ''[[The Vision of Constantine (Bernini)|The Vision of Constantine]]'' (1670) by [[Bernini]] in the north end.\n\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica. The central portal has a [[bronze]] door created by [[Filarete|Antonio Averulino]] c.&nbsp;1440 for the old basilica<ref>{{cite book |last=Decker |first=Heinrich |title=The Renaissance in Italy: Architecture \u2022 Sculpture \u2022 Frescoes |year=1969 |origyear=1967 |publisher=The Viking Press |location=New York |p=279}}</ref> and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space.\n\n====Maderno's nave====\n[[File:Vatican-StPierre-Int\u00e9rieur1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Maderno's nave, looking towards the chancel|alt= This photo of the interior reveals the near details of the arched ceiling which is divided into square coffers. The changes that Maderno made to the axis and width can be seen clearly in this picture.]]\nTo the single bay of [[Michelangelo]]'s Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient [[List of obelisks in Rome|Egyptian obelisk]] had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe nave has huge paired [[pilaster]]s, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building.<ref name=JL-M/><ref>The word \"stupendous\" is used by a number of writers trying to adequately describe the enormity of the interior. These include James Lees-Milne and Banister Fletcher.</ref> The four [[cherub]]s who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two [[holy water]] basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller [[chapel]]s and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, [[Gilding|gilt]], [[sculpture]] and [[mosaic]]. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces. \n\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its [[Baluster|balustrade]] are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n===Influence on church architecture===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced [[church architecture]] in [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]. Within Rome, the huge domed church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of [[San Carlo ai Catinari]], [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]], and many others. [[Christopher Wren]]'s dome at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] ([[London]], [[England]]), the domes of [[Karlskirche]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]]), [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church]] ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]), and the [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]) all pay [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago]], [[St. Josaphat's Basilica]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh]] and [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] in [[Montreal]], which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. [[Post-Modernism]] has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]].\n\n==Bernini's furnishings==\n[[File:The Chair of Saint Peter adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|The apse with St. Peter's Cathedra supported by four Doctors of the Church|alt=Pews before the ornate, gold-leafed throne of St. Peter]]\n\n===Pope Urban VIII and Bernini===\nAs a young boy [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter [[Annibale Carracci]] and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]] and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the [[Baroque]] period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the [[baldachin]] (baldaquin, from Italian: ''baldacchino''), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and [[loggia]]s in the piers of the dome and the [[Chair of Saint Peter|chair of St. Peter]].<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\n====Baldacchino and niches====\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Baldachin}}\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|baldacchino]], a pavilion-like structure {{convert|28.74|m|ft}} tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the [[Ciborium (architecture)|''ciborium'']], of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the [[Sacrament]]<!-- -Caps needed in this sense- --> is laid for the [[Eucharist]] and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ''ciboria'' are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the [[baldachin]] or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted [[Solomonic columns|barley-sugar shape]] had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Jerusalem]] and donated by the [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]]. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\n[[File:Interiorvaticano8baldaquino.jpg|High altar|thumb|left|The altar with Bernini's baldacchino|alt= Photo shows the baldachin standing in the centre of the church, viewed looking towards the nave. There is an altar beneath it which has a red and gold frontal cloth decorated with large crosses.]]\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'' in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\nAs part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four [[Balcony|balconies]]. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the [[Holy Lance|spear of Longinus]], said to have pierced the side of Christ, the [[veil of Veronica]], with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the [[True Cross]] discovered in [[Jerusalem]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], and a relic of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only ''Saint Longinus'' is the work of Bernini.<ref name=JL-M/> (See below)\n\n====Bernini's Towers====\n[[File:Cathedrapetri+gloria.jpg|thumb|Bernini's Cathedra Petri and ''Gloria''|alt=The chair-shaped bronze reliquary which holds the throne of St Peter is much larger than a normal chair, is ornate in shape and decorated with relief sculpture and gold leaf. The \"Gloria\" which surrounds a round window is a sculpture of clouds and sun-rays, surrounded by angels, the whole lot being covered in gleaming gold leaf.]]\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\n\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\n\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n====Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament====\n{{Main article|Chair of Saint Peter}}\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called ''[[Cathedra Petri]]'' or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, [[Pope Alexander VII]] determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four [[Doctors of the Church]], Saints [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine]] representing the Latin Church and [[Athanasius]] and [[John Chrysostom]], the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the Cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow [[alabaster]], illuminating, at its center, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, [[Andrea Sacchi]], had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.<ref name=\"JL-M\" /><ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nBernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament.<ref name=\"Basilica Info\">{{cite web|last=Kilby|first=Peter|title=St Peter's Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)|url=http://www.rome.info/vatican/st-peters-basilica/|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's [[Tempietto]], the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==St. Peter's Piazza==\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Square}}\n<!-- -NOTE:This section uses the well-known Italian word \"piazza\" because the English translation to \"square\" is a misnomer.- -->\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro (notte).jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's Basilica and the piazza at night|alt=Behind a large monolithic obelisk, the facade of St. Peter's Basilica, lit by floodlights, rising majestically against the night sky]]\nTo the east of the basilica is the ''Piazza di San Pietro'', ([[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]]). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the [[Baroque]] inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian [[obelisk]] which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade.<ref>The obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis by an unknown pharaoh of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (c. 2494 BC \u2013 2345 BC).</ref> The [[obelisk]], known as \"The Witness\", at {{convert|25.31|m|ft}} and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of {{convert|40|m|ft}}, is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the [[Circus of Nero]] in 37&nbsp;AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the [[crucifixion]] of Saint Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/Obelisk/Obelisk.htm|title=St. Peter's, the Obelisk |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> Its removal to its present location by order of [[Pope Sixtus V]] and engineered by [[Domenico Fontana]] on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of [[Sanremo]], and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Fountain of Carlo Maderno night.jpg|thumb|One of the two fountains which form the axis of the piazza.|alt=View of one fountain which rises in two tiers from a sculptured pool. The fountain is playing and the water is sparkling.]]\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large [[fountain]] designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] in [[Siena]]. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The [[trapezoid]] plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nBernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its center. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an [[entablature]] of the simple [[Tuscan order|Tuscan Order]].\n\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".<ref name=Gardner/>  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the [[Via della Conciliazione]], built by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaties]], leads from the [[Tiber|River Tiber]] to the [[Town square|piazza]] and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a [[terminating vista]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nBernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\".<ref name=Gardner/> Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility&nbsp;... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"<ref name=BF/>\n[[File:St Peter's Square, Vatican City - April 2007.jpg|upright=2.25|thumb|centre|View of Rome from the Dome of St. Peter's Basilica|alt=At the front of the view are the backs of thirteen large statues that stand in along the edge of the fa\u00e7ade. Beyond them can be seen the piazza which is in three parts. The nearest appears square, while the second widens into an oval surrounded on each side by the huge grey columns on the colonnade, and with the obelisk at its centre. Beyond that is a further square surrounded by pale pink buildings. A wide street leads from the square, at the end of which can be seen the river, a bridge and castle.]]\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows [[European mean time]]. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the roman clock is the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City]] since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"  \n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]] that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell '''Rota''' dates from 1288 and the bourdon called '''Campanone''' is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Bell#\n!Name\n!Mass \n!Casted\n|-\n|1\n|Campanella\n|260 kg\n|1825\n|-\n|2\n|Ave Maria \n|280 kg\n|1932\n|-\n|3\n|Predica\n|850 kg\n|1893\n|-\n|4\n|Rota\n|2 t\n|1288\n|-\n|5\n|Campanoncino (Mezzana, Benedittina)\n|4 t\n|1725\n|-\n|6\n|Campanone\n|9 t\n|1785\n|}\n\n==Treasures==\n[[File:Crypt air vent.jpg|thumb|[[Air vent]]s for the crypt in St. Peter's Basilica|alt=White and orange marble rings a circular, decorated bronze vent]]\n\n===Tombs and relics===\n{{Main article|List of papal tombs}}\nThere are over 100 [[tomb]]s within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto II]], and the composer [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]. Exiled Catholic British royalty [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and his two sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by [[Pope Clement XI]]. Also buried here are [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]], wife of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated her throne in order to convert to [[Catholicism]], and [[Countess]] [[Matilda of Tuscany]], supporter of the Papacy during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. The most recent interment was [[Pope John Paul II]], on 8 April 2005. Beneath, near the [[crypt]], is the recently discovered vaulted 4th-century \"[[Tomb of the Julii]]\". (See below for some descriptions of tombs).\n\n===Artworks===\n====Towers and narthex====\n* In the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\n* One of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by [[Giotto]] (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church.<ref name=Pinto/> The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\n* At each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north [[Constantine the Great]] by Bernini (1670) and to the south [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] (18th century).<ref name=Pinto/>\n* Of the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by [[Antonio di Pietro Averlino|Antonio Averulino]] (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the ''[[Door of the Dead in St. Peter's Basilica|Door of the Dead]]'', was designed by 20th-century sculptor [[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]] and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\n* The northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee year]] by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by [[Vico Consorti]] in 1950 and cast in [[Florence]] by the [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]].

One foot of the statue is largely worn away by [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] kissing it for centuries.\n* The sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican [[Grotto]]es (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by [[Canova]] of [[Pope Pius VI]], who was captured and mistreated by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\n* In the Confessio is the ''Niche of the Pallium'' (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\n* The High [[Altar]] is surmounted by Bernini's [[baldachin]]. (See above)\n* Set in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] holding the [[True Cross]] and the [[Nail (relic)|Holy Nails]], by [[Andrea Bolgi]]; [[Saint Longinus]] holding the [[Holy Lance|spear that pierced the side of Jesus]], by Bernini (1639); [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] with the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], by [[Francois Duquesnoy]] and [[Saint Veronica]] holding her [[Veil of Veronica|veil with the image of Jesus' face]], by [[Francesco Mochi]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"150px\">\nFile:Saint Helena.jpg|alt= A marble statue showing a matronly woman in a sweeping cloak supporting a cross which stands beside her and presenting a set of nails to the viewer with her left hand|''Saint Helena''<br>by Andrea Bolgi\nFile:Saint Longinus.jpg|alt= This statue shows a Roman soldier, with a cloak furling around him, gazing upward while he supports a long spear with his right hand and throws out his other hand in amazement.|''Saint Longinus''<br>by Bernini\nFile:Saint Andreas.jpg|alt= This statue shows an elderly man, bare-chested, and draped, looking up despairingly as he supports a large cross, arranged diagonally.|''Saint Andrew''<br>by Francois Duquesnoy\nFile:Saint veronica.jpg|alt= This statue shows the saint as a young woman, who, with a sweeping dramatic gesture, displays a cloth on which there is an image of the face of Jesus.|''Saint Veronica''<br>by Francesco Mochi\n</gallery>\n\n====North aisle====\n* In the first chapel of the north aisle is [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''.<ref>The statue was damaged in 1972 by Lazlo Toft, a Hungarian-Australian, who considered that the veneration shown to the statue was idolatrous. The damage was repaired and the statue subsequently placed behind glass.</ref>\n* On the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\n* The second chapel, dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian]], contains the statues of popes [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of [[Pope Innocent XI]] but his remains were moved to the ''Altar of the Transfiguration'' on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of [[Pope John Paul II]]. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\n* The large chapel on the right aisle is the ''Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament'' which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' at [[San Pietro in Montorio]] supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the [[Holy Trinity]] by [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n* Near the altar of ''Our Lady of Succour'' are the monuments of popes [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] by [[Camillo Rusconi]] (1723) and [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]].\n* At the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of [[Saint Petronilla]] and with an altarpiece ''The Burial of St Petronilla'' by [[Guercino]] (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n====South aisle====\n* The first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and designed by [[Carlo Fontana]], (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font, which was previously located in the opposite chapel, is the red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] of Probus, the 4th-century [[Prefect]] of Rome. The lid came from a different [[sarcophagus]], which had once held the remains of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] and in removing it from the Vatican Grotto where it had been stored, the workmen broke it into ten pieces. Fontana restored it expertly and surmounted it with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\".\n* Against the first pier of the aisle is the [[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]], James and his sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]], known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" and [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry, Cardinal and Duke of York]]. The tomb is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] design by [[Canova]] unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]].\n* The second chapel is that of the ''Presentation of the Virgin'' and contains the memorials of [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].\n* Against the piers are the tombs of [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]].\n* The large chapel off the south aisle is the ''Choir Chapel'' which contains the altar of the ''[[Immaculate Conception]]''.\n* At the entrance to the [[Sacristy]] is the tomb of [[Pope Pius VIII]]\n* The south transept contains the altars of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint Joseph]] and the ''Crucifixion of [[Saint Peter]]''.\n* The tomb of Fabio Chigi, [[Pope Alexander VII]], towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the [[Baroque]] Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] and [[Truth]]. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant [[England]]. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of [[Death]],<!-- -NOTE: Death requires a capital letter in this sense.- --> its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an [[hourglass]] stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Rome basilica st peter 004 adjusted.JPG|alt= A pair of bronze doors divided into sixteen panels containing reliefs depicting scenes mainly from the life of Jesus and stories that he told.|The Holy Door is opened only for great celebrations.\nFile:0 Monument fun\u00e9raire du pape Alexandre VII - St-Pierre - Vatican (1).jpg|alt= A large memorial set in a niche.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the [[Cherokee removal]] of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.<ref>Barclay 1946, p. 8-11</ref>\n\n===Early mining history===\n[[Image:Hiwasseemine-stack-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Boiler chimney marking the location where copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843]]\nCopper was first discovered by a European American in the Copper Basin in August 1843 in a creek, now known as Potato Creek, southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine, by a prospector named Lemmons who was reportedly panning for gold.<ref name=frye7>Frye 2017, p. 7</ref><ref name=brooks19>Brooks 1990, p. 19</ref> This discovery sparked interest among regional entrepreneurs and opportunists, although the lack of major roads in and out of the basin complicated early mining operations.

This mine would eventually become the most productive mine in the basin.<ref>Maysilles 2011, p. 37</ref> The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] into the air, killing off all vegetation in the Copper Basin region.

In 1899 several employees of the DCS&I [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union. The strike was settled after the intervention of law enforcement.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a flotation plant to produce copper sulfate in the 1920s. Iron and zinc concentrates were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987. The Tennessee Chemical Company filed for bankruptcy on April 10, 1989.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 38</ref> The sulfuric acid plant continued to operate until 2000, with raw materials acquired elsewhere.<ref name=waters/>\n\n==Environmental issues and reclamation==\n[[File:A train bringing copper ore out of the mine, Ducktown, Tenn.1a34324v.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Copper Basin in 1939]]\nAt first, the forests in the Copper Basin were logged to fuel the smelters, and as early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce. In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v.

In 1939, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the Tennessee Copper Company began a joint effort to plant replacement trees, and the soil was treated with lime to remove the acidity.<ref name=tva/> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camp was established in the basin in 1941 to aid in the reforestation efforts.<ref name=waters/> By the 2000s, the area had been mostly reclaimed.<ref name=nyt07>{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Chris|title=Up From the Mines in Tennessee|date=December 14, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/travel/escapes/14copperhill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Recent history==\n[[Image:Ducktown-basin-museum-misc-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Mining machine parts and tools scattered about the Burra Burra Mine site]]\nThe Ducktown Basin Museum was established in 1978 by a group of local citizens intent on preserving the legacy of the Copper Basin.

In particular he is also known by the nickname \"Turkeater\" due to the fact that he never lost to a Turkish fighter and scored eleven victories against Turkish opposition, with a final score of 11-0. So far, the majority of his wins have been knock-outs. He has been technically knocked out twice himself early in his career due to cuts, but after 2002, his next technical knock-out defeat came in 2008 against [[Andy Souwer]] in an extra round.\n\nFrom 2000 till 2002, Zambidis defeated notable kickboxer Jenk Behic twice, G\u00fcrkan \u00d6zkan twice (who outweighed Zambidis by 30 pounds), Baris Nezif, Wanlop Sosathopan, Bakari Tounkara, Matteo Sciacca and Petr Polak.

On November 26, 2002 he won the K-1 Oceania MAX 2002 title after defeating [[John Wayne Parr]] in the final.\n\nIn 2003, promoter [[Tarik Solak]] arranged Zambidis' debut fight in [[Japan]] against 2002 World [[K-1|K-1 Max]] Champion [[Albert Kraus]], whom he knocked out in the 2nd round. In April 2005, Zambidis knocked out with a right hook the popular [[Norifumi Yamamoto|Norifumi \"Kid\" Yamamoto]], in front of thousands of the [[Japan]]ese kickboxer's fans. Zambidis' weakness seems to be receiving low kicks, as was seen in his 2006 defeat by Japanese [[Yoshihiro Sato]], who, despite getting hurt by Zambidis' punches, managed to land many kicks and knees which racked up enough points to \"secure a unanimous decision.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045553/http://www.mmaringreport.com/k-1/kids-quick-ko-headlines-heros.html Kid's Quick KO Headlines Hero's\"] Retrieved 22-Mar-2011</ref> Zambidis is a 4 time national champion in kickboxing as well as holding a large number of international titles.\n\nIn addition to his many outstanding fights, the [[K-1 World MAX 2010 -70kg World Championship Tournament Final|K-1 World MAX 2010 Final 16]] match on October the 3rd, 2010 against [[Chahid Oulad El Hadj]] was notable as being one of the most exciting of his career. In addition, as stated by ring side commentators \"Sugar\" [[Ray Sefo]] and Michael \"The Voice\" Schiavello, this contest was one by which a standard was set for other K-1 fights. However, Zambidis did not make it to the final as he lost to [[Giorgio Petrosyan]] by controversial unanimous decision. Zambidis clearly knocked down Petrosyan in the fight, but it was ruled a slip by the referee. Therefore, Petrosyan did not lose the round 10-8 as he should have, and the fight was not permitted to go to an extension fourth round. At the time, Zambidis came the closest to breaking Petrosyan's legendary undefeated streak.\n\nZambidis fought a rubber match (both having won 1 match apiece) with Australian Muay Thai champion [[John Wayne Parr]] in May 2011. He lost by TKO (three knockdowns) in round 1.\n\nHe defeated Reece McAllister by unanimous decision in the quarter-finals of the ''[[K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final]]'' in Athens, Greece on December 15, 2012. He was then battered into submission by the eventual champion [[Murthel Groenhart]] in the semis. The much larger Groenhart ruthlessly trashed Zambidis with knees and punches, forcing his corner to stop the fight at the end of round two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2000:k-1-world-max-final-8-tournament-line-up&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2134:k-1-world-max-2012-final-live-results&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe was expected to compete in a four-man tournament in Russia on May 25, 2013, facing [[Dzhabar Askerov]] in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2345:mike-zambidis-dzhabar-askerov-artur-kyshenko-and-yuri-bessmertny-set-for-4-man-tournament-in-russia&catid=37:kickboxing|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> However, he was replaced by [[Enriko Gogokhia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightsportasia.com/2013/05/15/mike-zambidis-out-of-legends-4-man-tournament-in-russia-replaced-by-enriko-gogohiya/ |title=Mike Zambidis Out of LEGENDS 4 Man Tournament in Russia; Replaced by Enriko Gogohiya |author=Fight Sport Asia |work=Fight Sport Asia |accessdate=6 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024104815/http://fightsportasia.com/2013/05/15/mike-zambidis-out-of-legends-4-man-tournament-in-russia-replaced-by-enriko-gogohiya/ |archivedate=24 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nZambidis beat Harun Kina by unanimous decision for the vacant SUPERKOMBAT Middleweight Championship at SUPERKOMBAT VIP Edition in Bucharest, Romania on August 31, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2616:mike-zambidis-to-headline-superkombat-vip-edition&catid=37:kickboxing|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2635:mike-zambidis-wins-at-superkombat-vip-edition&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe was scheduled to fight Elam Ngor at the ''K-1 World MAX 2013 World Championship Tournament Final 16'' in Majorca, Spain on September 14, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2558:k-1-announces-k-1-world-max-final-16-in-spain&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2640:k-1-announces-k-1-world-max-2013-final-16-tournament-fights&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> However, he withdrew from the tournament and was replaced by Ismat Aghazade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2645:a-few-k-1-updates-zambo-out-stream-is-now-free&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe lost to [[Xu Yan (kickboxer)|Xu Yan]] by unanimous decision, suffering knockdowns in rounds one and two, at ''Hero Legends'' in Jinan, China on January 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muaythaiauthority.com/2014/01/hero-legends-2014-results-and-recap.html |title=Hero Legends 2014 Results and Recap ~ Muay Thai Authority |accessdate=6 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040354/http://www.muaythaiauthority.com/2014/01/hero-legends-2014-results-and-recap.html |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nZambidis and [[Batu Khasikov]] had a rematch fight and challenge the WKN Heavyweight Kickboxing World Championship at Fight Night: Battle of Moscow XV event in [[Moscow, Russia]] on March 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightmag.net/?p=27361|title=Leading show in Russia \u2018Fight Nights\u2019 sanctions with WKN|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> The Russian Batu Khasikov won the battle again for the second time.\n\nHe won his first defence of his SUPERKOMBAT middleweight title against Harun Kina on January 17 at Iron Challenge 2015 from [[Athens, Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaplus.co.uk/kickboxing/superkombat-mike-zambidis-defend-middleweight-title-harun-kina/#sthash.DB8pKAGV.wobtI9vk.dpbs|title=Superkombat: Mike Zambidis to defend middleweight title against Harun Kina|publisher=mmaplus.co.uk|date=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015 he announced he would retire after his final fight in June against [[Steve Moxon]], in his home country of Greece.

In particular he is also known by the nickname \"Turkeater\" due to the fact that he never lost to a Turkish fighter and scored eleven victories against Turkish opposition, with a final score of 11-0. So far, the majority of his wins have been knock-outs. He has been technically knocked out twice himself early in his career due to cuts, but after 2002, his next technical knock-out defeat came in 2008 against [[Andy Souwer]] in an extra round.\n\nFrom 2000 till 2002, Zambidis defeated notable kickboxer Jenk Behic twice, G\u00fcrkan \u00d6zkan twice (who outweighed Zambidis by 30 pounds), Baris Nezif, Wanlop Sosathopan, Bakari Tounkara, Matteo Sciacca and Petr Polak.

On November 26, 2002 he won the K-1 Oceania MAX 2002 title after defeating [[John Wayne Parr]] in the final.\n\nIn 2003, promoter [[Tarik Solak]] arranged Zambidis' debut fight in [[Japan]] against 2002 World [[K-1|K-1 Max]] Champion [[Albert Kraus]], whom he knocked out in the 2nd round. In April 2005, Zambidis knocked out with a right hook the popular [[Norifumi Yamamoto|Norifumi \"Kid\" Yamamoto]], in front of thousands of the [[Japan]]ese kickboxer's fans. Zambidis' weakness seems to be receiving low kicks, as was seen in his 2006 defeat by Japanese [[Yoshihiro Sato]], who, despite getting hurt by Zambidis' punches, managed to land many kicks and knees which racked up enough points to \"secure a unanimous decision.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045553/http://www.mmaringreport.com/k-1/kids-quick-ko-headlines-heros.html Kid's Quick KO Headlines Hero's\"] Retrieved 22-Mar-2011</ref> Zambidis is a 4 time national champion in kickboxing as well as holding a large number of international titles.\n\nIn addition to his many outstanding fights, the [[K-1 World MAX 2010 -70kg World Championship Tournament Final|K-1 World MAX 2010 Final 16]] match on October the 3rd, 2010 against [[Chahid Oulad El Hadj]] was notable as being one of the most exciting of his career. In addition, as stated by ring side commentators \"Sugar\" [[Ray Sefo]] and Michael \"The Voice\" Schiavello, this contest was one by which a standard was set for other K-1 fights. However, Zambidis did not make it to the final as he lost to [[Giorgio Petrosyan]] by controversial unanimous decision. Zambidis clearly knocked down Petrosyan in the fight, but it was ruled a slip by the referee. Therefore, Petrosyan did not lose the round 10-8 as he should have, and the fight was not permitted to go to an extension fourth round. At the time, Zambidis came the closest to breaking Petrosyan's legendary undefeated streak.\n\nZambidis fought a rubber match (both having won 1 match apiece) with Australian Muay Thai champion [[John Wayne Parr]] in May 2011. He lost by TKO (three knockdowns) in round 1.\n\nHe defeated Reece McAllister by unanimous decision in the quarter-finals of the ''[[K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final]]'' in Athens, Greece on December 15, 2012. He was then battered into submission by the eventual champion [[Murthel Groenhart]] in the semis. The much larger Groenhart ruthlessly trashed Zambidis with knees and punches, forcing his corner to stop the fight at the end of round two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2000:k-1-world-max-final-8-tournament-line-up&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2134:k-1-world-max-2012-final-live-results&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe was expected to compete in a four-man tournament in Russia on May 25, 2013, facing [[Dzhabar Askerov]] in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2345:mike-zambidis-dzhabar-askerov-artur-kyshenko-and-yuri-bessmertny-set-for-4-man-tournament-in-russia&catid=37:kickboxing|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> However, he was replaced by [[Enriko Gogokhia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightsportasia.com/2013/05/15/mike-zambidis-out-of-legends-4-man-tournament-in-russia-replaced-by-enriko-gogohiya/ |title=Mike Zambidis Out of LEGENDS 4 Man Tournament in Russia; Replaced by Enriko Gogohiya |author=Fight Sport Asia |work=Fight Sport Asia |accessdate=6 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024104815/http://fightsportasia.com/2013/05/15/mike-zambidis-out-of-legends-4-man-tournament-in-russia-replaced-by-enriko-gogohiya/ |archivedate=24 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nZambidis beat Harun Kina by unanimous decision for the vacant SUPERKOMBAT Middleweight Championship at SUPERKOMBAT VIP Edition in Bucharest, Romania on August 31, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2616:mike-zambidis-to-headline-superkombat-vip-edition&catid=37:kickboxing|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2635:mike-zambidis-wins-at-superkombat-vip-edition&catid=39:europe&Itemid=59|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe was scheduled to fight Elam Ngor at the ''K-1 World MAX 2013 World Championship Tournament Final 16'' in Majorca, Spain on September 14, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2558:k-1-announces-k-1-world-max-final-16-in-spain&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2640:k-1-announces-k-1-world-max-2013-final-16-tournament-fights&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> However, he withdrew from the tournament and was replaced by Ismat Aghazade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2645:a-few-k-1-updates-zambo-out-stream-is-now-free&catid=36:k-1|title=LiverKick - LiverKick|author=Dave Walsh|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe lost to [[Xu Yan (kickboxer)|Xu Yan]] by unanimous decision, suffering knockdowns in rounds one and two, at ''Hero Legends'' in Jinan, China on January 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muaythaiauthority.com/2014/01/hero-legends-2014-results-and-recap.html |title=Hero Legends 2014 Results and Recap ~ Muay Thai Authority |accessdate=6 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040354/http://www.muaythaiauthority.com/2014/01/hero-legends-2014-results-and-recap.html |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nZambidis and [[Batu Khasikov]] had a rematch fight and challenge the WKN Heavyweight Kickboxing World Championship at Fight Night: Battle of Moscow XV event in [[Moscow, Russia]] on March 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightmag.net/?p=27361|title=Leading show in Russia \u2018Fight Nights\u2019 sanctions with WKN|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> The Russian Batu Khasikov won the battle again for the second time.\n\nHe won his first defence of his SUPERKOMBAT middleweight title against Harun Kina on January 17 at Iron Challenge 2015 from [[Athens, Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaplus.co.uk/kickboxing/superkombat-mike-zambidis-defend-middleweight-title-harun-kina/#sthash.DB8pKAGV.wobtI9vk.dpbs|title=Superkombat: Mike Zambidis to defend middleweight title against Harun Kina|publisher=mmaplus.co.uk|date=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2015 he announced he would retire after his final fight in June against [[Steve Moxon]], in his home country of Greece.
