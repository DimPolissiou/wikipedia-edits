This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0[[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nIn the 18th century Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was just a part of a settlement as one municipality. When the municipality of San Isidro de Potot was created it became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:Jose burgos PG.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western most part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIn February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. Don Mauricio Gallardo was made the president of the town. The Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro.\n\n===American Occupation===\nIn November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n===World War II===\nDuring the Japanese Occupation in the year 1941-1945 was an era of terror and fear although the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed other barrios of the town, this was due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.\n\nIn December 15, at the outbreak of World War II, for the second time the people felt danger and insecurity for their life and property that the Japanese soldiers were invading the country, while fighting the Japanese army, the people of the town looked after for their safety. Some went to caves nearby, others to the forests and still others made dug-outs, upon assuring their safety some families vacated their houses while those at home continued to live in fear.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan.

This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho|''Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho'']]. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nOn the western part of [[Pangasinan]], along the coast of the China Sea lies a town called - Burgos, perched on a broad plateau. This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0[[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nIn the 18th century Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was just a part of a settlement as one municipality. When the municipality of San Isidro de Potot was created it became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:Jose burgos PG.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western most part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIn February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. Don Mauricio Gallardo was made the president of the town. The Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro.\n\n===American Occupation===\nIn November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan.

Some went to caves nearby, others to the forests and still others made dug-outs, upon assuring their safety some families vacated their houses while those at home continued to live in fear.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan. It lies in the coastal sitio of Cabongaoan in barangay Ilio-ilio.\n\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*'''Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)''': Cabongaoan Beach has another feature that makes it a cut above the rest of Pangasinan's beaches: the so-called \"Death Pool.\" This tidal pool on the rocky side of the beach gets filled with water when the waves crash against it. This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho|''Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho'']]. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente.

He therefore learns several languages (French, English, German, Spanish) and keeps on revising ''Il Monoclino'' (his debut book that in 1984 will be published with the definitive title of ''[[Seminar on Youth]]'')<ref>Read a ''New York Times'' article about ''Seminar on Youth'' [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/books/successful-misfit.html]</ref>.\nBack in [[Italy]] he works occasionally as an interpreter (experience that will be at the basis of his second novel ''[[The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman]]''<ref>Read a ''New York Times'' article about ''The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman''[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/30/books/eroticism-is-watching-oneself.html]</ref> and he engages in his first translations from English and German. In the meantime he gets a G.E.D. in [[Florence]] in 1976 and in 1981 he graduates in Foreign Languages and Literatures at Universit\u00e0 di [[Verona]], with a thesis on the American poet [[John Ashbery]]. Of Ashbery in 1983 Busi will translate ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (poetry collection)|Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'' that will eventually win the prestigious Accademia dei Lincei prize<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Aldo Busi'', Florence, Cadmo, 2007</ref>.\nAmong Busi's spiritual fathers appear [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[Marcel Proust]]<ref>An interview on www.italialibri.net {{in lang|it}}[http://www.italialibri.net/arretratis/novita1100.html]</ref>.\n\n===Maturity and success: the novelist, the essayist, the translator===\nBusi puts the novel to the center of his production (he wrote seven) as he considers it to be the highest form of literature for structure complexity, aesthetic contents and expressive flexibility. Close observer of society and customs, particularly Italian ones, his characters reflect a deep psychological insight, and their fictional context is outlined with vivid impressionistic realism<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\n\nLeft-wing, feminist and political militant for homosexual rights, fervently anticlerical in his life and in his art, he published a serie of five \u00abend-of-millennium\u00bb essays and six manuals \u00abfor a perfect humanity\u00bb that analyse contemporary socio-political issues and propose some guidelines to handle them in daily life. Because of his open stances and his straightforward language and depictions, he finds himself to be often in the middle of given and received lawsuits.\nParticular attention wins in 1990 the case of his fourth book ''[[Sodomies in Elevenpoint]]'', that receives a large media coverage but for which he is fully absolved<ref>An article about the trial from the newspaper ''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}}[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1990/03/14/busi-non-osceno.html]</ref>.\nIt will only be the parent of his legal proceedings, because the same fate will affect several of his future works, magazines and newspapers articles, and TV appearances<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\n\nHis extensive literary production includes also seven travel books (among which ''[[Uses and Abuses]]'')<ref>See a ''The Independent'' article on ''Uses and Abuses'' [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/no-one-to-have-sex-with-in-iceland-1538691.html]</ref>, two novellas, a collection of stories, two fables, a theatre play, a screenplay, two song books and two self-portraits.\nIndefatigable traveller, his reports from the five continents also consistently contribute to his fame as a valued narrator and observer<ref>For an analysis on his works see the monograph {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\nHe occasionally writes also for newspapers and magazines.\n\nHis personal research as a scholar of languages and as a translator from foreign languages leads him to also translate some works of the Italian Middle Ages and Renaissance from ancient to modern Italian, such as Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', Castiglione's ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (with [[Carmen Covito]]), Ruzante, and ''The Novellino'' by anonymous author of the 13th century (with Carmen Covito).\nAccording to Busi, nowadays several classics of Italian literature, including ''Divine Comedy'', are more known abroad than in Italy, because language update hasn't yet become a customary on the Italian literary scene.\nHis translation of ''The Decameron'' will be awarded in 2013 with the Premio Letterario Boccaccio<ref>Interview to Aldo Busi on translation, on the occasion of the Premio Letterario Boccaccio prize-awarding {{in lang|it}} [https://www.premioletterarioboccaccio.it/la-storia-del-premio/256-una-lingua-che-cambia-in-continuazione-\u2013-aldo-busi-intervistato-su-boccaccio.html]</ref>.\nFollowing the same philosophy of language update, between 1995 and 2008 Busi directs for the publisher Frassinelli a book serie of some classics from the most important modern literatures, that proposes new translations which use all the linguistic registers of contemporary language.\nBetween 2004 and 2009 he also has the TV serie on Literature ''Amici libri'' (trans. \"Book friends\") inside a talent show, where he also plays the role of teacher of General Education<ref>A transcript of some of these lessons can be found in {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli (a cura di), ''Dritte per l'aspirante artista (televisivo): Aldo Busi fa lezione ad Amici'', Milan, Feltrinelli, 2005.</ref>.\n\nIn 2006 the literary critic Marco Cavalli writes the first monograph on Aldo Busi titled ''Busi in corpo 11'', where he describes, analyses and comments the whole writer's work.\n \n=== The immobility of Italy and the \u00abwriting strike\u00bb ===\nAround half of the 2000s the writer declares to be tired and disappointed by the immobility of culture and politics of his own country. He claims also that his work has been boycotted by Italy and decides to withdraw from writing, at least from organic novel writing<ref>See an article on the newspaper ''Corriere della sera'' {{in lang|it}} [https://www.corriere.it/cultura/libri/11_agosto_01/di-stefano-aldo-busi_99df8d24-bc40-11e0-9ecf-692ab361efb9.shtml]</ref>.\nIn the following years, therefore, his releases are much more sporadic then before, and limited to some minor works and to the revision of old material. The only exception is represented by the novel ''El especialista de Barcelona'', that according to him is totally unexpected to the writer himself, and that, not for nothing, talks also about a writer's tackling against a book that wants to be written<ref>See article on the newspaper''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/repubblica-delle-idee/edizione2012/2012/10/02/news/busi_il_mio_nuovo_romanzo_rimasto_senza_editore-43691941/]</ref>.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\n* ''[[Seminar on Youth]]'' ''(Seminario sulla giovent\u00f9)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1989, {{ISBN|0571152899}}\n\n* ''[[The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman]]'' ''(Vita standard di un venditore provvisorio di collant)'', translated by [[Raymond Rosenthal]], New York, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1988; London, Faber and Faber, 1990, {{ISBN|0374528195}}\n\n* ''La delfina bizantina'', Milan, Mondadori, 1986.\n\n* ''Vendita galline Km 2'', Milan, Mondadori, 1993.\n\n* ''Suicidi dovuti'', Milan, Frassinelli, 1996.\n\n* ''Casanova di se stessi'', Milan, Mondadori, 2000.\n\n* ''El especialista de Barcelona'', Milan, Dalai Editore, 2012.\n\n=== Travel Proses ===\n\n* ''[[Sodomies in Elevenpoint]]'' ''(Sodomie in corpo 11)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1992, {{ISBN|0571142052}}\n\n* ''[[Uses and Abuses]]'' ''(Altri abusi)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1997, {{ISBN|0571179053}}\n\n* ''Cazzi e canguri (pochissimi i canguri)'', Milan, Frassinelli, 1994.\n\n* ''Aloha!!!!!

He therefore learns several languages (French, English, German, Spanish) and keeps on revising ''Il Monoclino'' (his debut book that in 1984 will be published with the definitive title of ''[[Seminar on Youth]]'')<ref>Read a ''New York Times'' article about ''Seminar on Youth'' [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/books/successful-misfit.html]</ref>.\nBack in [[Italy]] he works occasionally as an interpreter (experience that will be at the basis of his second novel ''[[The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman]]''<ref>Read a ''New York Times'' article about ''The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman''[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/30/books/eroticism-is-watching-oneself.html]</ref> and he engages in his first translations from English and German. In the meantime he gets a G.E.D. in [[Florence]] in 1976 and in 1981 he graduates in Foreign Languages and Literatures at Universit\u00e0 di [[Verona]], with a thesis on the American poet [[John Ashbery]]. Of Ashbery in 1983 Busi will translate ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (poetry collection)|Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'' that will eventually win the prestigious Accademia dei Lincei prize<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Aldo Busi'', Florence, Cadmo, 2007</ref>.\nAmong Busi's spiritual fathers appear [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[Marcel Proust]]<ref>An interview on www.italialibri.net {{in lang|it}}[http://www.italialibri.net/arretratis/novita1100.html]</ref>.\n\n===Maturity and success: the novelist, the essayist, the translator===\nBusi puts the novel to the center of his production (he wrote seven) as he considers it to be the highest form of literature for structure complexity, aesthetic contents and expressive flexibility. Close observer of society and customs, particularly Italian ones, his characters reflect a deep psychological insight, and their fictional context is outlined with vivid impressionistic realism<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\n\nLeft-wing, feminist and political militant for homosexual rights, fervently anticlerical in his life and in his art, he published a serie of five \u00abend-of-millennium\u00bb essays and six manuals \u00abfor a perfect humanity\u00bb that analyse contemporary socio-political issues and propose some guidelines to handle them in daily life. Because of his open stances and his straightforward language and depictions, he finds himself to be often in the middle of given and received lawsuits.\nParticular attention wins in 1990 the case of his fourth book ''[[Sodomies in Elevenpoint]]'', that receives a large media coverage but for which he is fully absolved<ref>An article about the trial from the newspaper ''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}}[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1990/03/14/busi-non-osceno.html]</ref>.\nIt will only be the parent of his legal proceedings, because the same fate will affect several of his future works, magazines and newspapers articles, and TV appearances<ref> Read {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\n\nHis extensive literary production includes also seven travel books (among which ''[[Uses and Abuses]]'')<ref>See a ''The Independent'' article on ''Uses and Abuses'' [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/no-one-to-have-sex-with-in-iceland-1538691.html]</ref>, two novellas, a collection of stories, two fables, a theatre play, a screenplay, two song books and two self-portraits.\nIndefatigable traveller, his reports from the five continents also consistently contribute to his fame as a valued narrator and observer<ref>For an analysis on his works see the monograph {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli, ''Busi in corpo 11'', Milan, Il Saggiatore, 2006</ref>.\nHe occasionally writes also for newspapers and magazines.\n\nHis personal research as a scholar of languages and as a translator from foreign languages leads him to also translate some works of the Italian Middle Ages and Renaissance from ancient to modern Italian, such as Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', Castiglione's ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (with [[Carmen Covito]]), Ruzante, and ''The Novellino'' by anonymous author of the 13th century (with Carmen Covito).\nAccording to Busi, nowadays several classics of Italian literature, including ''Divine Comedy'', are more known abroad than in Italy, because language update hasn't yet become a customary on the Italian literary scene.\nHis translation of ''The Decameron'' will be awarded in 2013 with the Premio Letterario Boccaccio<ref>Interview to Aldo Busi on translation, on the occasion of the Premio Letterario Boccaccio prize-awarding {{in lang|it}} [https://www.premioletterarioboccaccio.it/la-storia-del-premio/256-una-lingua-che-cambia-in-continuazione-\u2013-aldo-busi-intervistato-su-boccaccio.html]</ref>.\nFollowing the same philosophy of language update, between 1995 and 2008 Busi directs for the publisher Frassinelli a book serie of some classics from the most important modern literatures, that proposes new translations which use all the linguistic registers of contemporary language.\nBetween 2004 and 2009 he also has the TV serie on Literature ''Amici libri'' (trans. \"Book friends\") inside a talent show, where he also plays the role of teacher of General Education<ref>A transcript of some of these lessons can be found in {{in lang|it}} M. Cavalli (a cura di), ''Dritte per l'aspirante artista (televisivo): Aldo Busi fa lezione ad Amici'', Milan, Feltrinelli, 2005.</ref>.\n\nIn 2006 the literary critic Marco Cavalli writes the first monograph on Aldo Busi titled ''Busi in corpo 11'', where he describes, analyses and comments the whole writer's work.\n \n=== The immobility of Italy and the \u00abwriting strike\u00bb ===\nAround half of the 2000's the writer declares to be tired and disappointed by the immobility of culture and politics of his own country. He claims also that his work has been boycotted by Italy and decides to withdraw from writing, at least from organic novel writing<ref>See an article on the newspaper ''Corriere della sera'' {{in lang|it}} [https://www.corriere.it/cultura/libri/11_agosto_01/di-stefano-aldo-busi_99df8d24-bc40-11e0-9ecf-692ab361efb9.shtml]</ref>.\nIn the following years, therefore, his releases are much more sporadic then before, and limited to some minor works and to the revision of old material. The only exception is represented by the novel ''El especialista de Barcelona'', that according to him is totally unexpected to the writer himself, and that, not for nothing, talks also about a writer's tackling against a book that wants to be written<ref>See article on the newspaper''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/repubblica-delle-idee/edizione2012/2012/10/02/news/busi_il_mio_nuovo_romanzo_rimasto_senza_editore-43691941/]</ref>.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\n* ''[[Seminar on Youth]]'' ''(Seminario sulla giovent\u00f9)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1989, {{ISBN|0571152899}}\n\n* ''[[The Standard Life of a Temporary Pantyhose Salesman]]'' ''(Vita standard di un venditore provvisorio di collant)'', translated by [[Raymond Rosenthal]], New York, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1988; London, Faber and Faber, 1990, {{ISBN|0374528195}}\n\n* ''La delfina bizantina'', Milan, Mondadori, 1986.\n\n* ''Vendita galline Km 2'', Milan, Mondadori, 1993.\n\n* ''Suicidi dovuti'', Milan, Frassinelli, 1996.\n\n* ''Casanova di se stessi'', Milan, Mondadori, 2000.\n\n* ''El especialista de Barcelona'', Milan, Dalai Editore, 2012.\n\n=== Travel Proses ===\n\n* ''[[Sodomies in Elevenpoint]]'' ''(Sodomie in corpo 11)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1992, {{ISBN|0571142052}}\n\n* ''[[Uses and Abuses]]'' ''(Altri abusi)'', translated by [[Stuart Hood]], London, Faber and Faber, 1997, {{ISBN|0571179053}}\n\n* ''Cazzi e canguri (pochissimi i canguri)'', Milan, Frassinelli, 1994.\n\n* ''Aloha!!!!!

One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n====16 years later====\nPurnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her and she wins at 1st place. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya. Purnima also teaches some kids Maths and English.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni is also very diet conscious. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there. Her choice is Kartik and not Sumreet. Beena tries to convince her, but in no vain. Later, Soni questions Kartik about Purnima's book. Later, the family is visiting the temple and Shanaya makes a charade that her foot has been sprained. Shanaya gets rid of Purnima and throws a party at her house,. occasion is her marriage with Kartik. Purnima finds out about this she stops the party and during such she slaps Shanaya. Shanaya makes another charade, making her mother slap Purnima and throws her outside the house. Kuldeep returns the next morning finding Purnima sleeping outside. Kuldeep finds out the truth and as usual Shanaya refuses to apologise. Kartik convinces Soni to go and visit the Aroras. When Soni visits the Aroras, she comes 30 mins beforehand and Purnima mistakenly gets some water on Soni. Soni treats Purnima as a maid (Purnima's father was not at home when this happened). Shanaya is not at home when Soni visits and goes to meet Kartik. Shanaya confesses to Kartik. Beena tells Shanaya about Soni's wish (Shanaya should not take part in Miss Punjab contest) and Shanaya refuses to abide. Shanaya also tells Beena that she confessed to Kartik. Soni fixes Shanaya's and Sumreet's engagement. Kartik and Purnima had a near accident situation where a sobbing Purnima told Kartik that he is a liar. Kartik thinks about this overnight and gets Purnima's information from her eye donation form. He calls Purnima and Shanaya tells the family that her boyfriend called her. Purnima shuts Beena up as she starts questioning her character. Kartik was heading to find Purnima's house and on the way he finds a hurt Kuldeep. Outside the house, Kartik and Purnima bump into each other. Kartik notices his bracelet on Purnima's hand.\n\nSumreet calls Kartik to help him choose a ring for engagement. Kartik asks Sumreet to call Shanaya to ask if Shanaya is happy about the marriage. Shanaya says she is happy thus making Kartik more confused. The females of the families go for shopping for Shanaya's engagement outfit. Soni forgot her wallet and Kartik drops it by. He spots Purnima at the shop choosing some outfits for herself. The outfit is expensive and Purnima cannot afford it. Kartik overhears the shop attendant's comment which was offending and scolds at him. Kartik buys the outfit. Purnima is given a lot of outfits to carry and she slips most of them on Soni. She is forced to apologise and refer to Soni as \"Madam\". Purnima receives the outfit and mother-daughter duo don't leave a chance to not question Purnima's character.\n\nSoni hatches a plan against Purnima, calling her to the Mehras to help in the engagement arrangements and then humiliating her. While cleaning some rooms, Purnima enters Kartik's room, she realises that it's Kartik's room after seeing a picture of Kartik and Soni. Soni tells Purnima to change curtains and Purnima falls onto Kartik as she can't balance herself. Soni was about to slap Purnima but Kartik stopped her. While going to the Mehra's mansion for engagement, Beena mistakenly drops the ring which Purnima finds while talking with the children she teaches. Beena realises that and Kartik volunteers to go fetch it. Luckily, Purnima is already there with the ring. As Purnima was returning home, she notices fire on Beena's saree and runs to save her. While doing this, Soni finds out Purnima is actually the family's elder daughter. At home, Purnima defends Beena when Kuldeep rebukes her for hiding the truth from the Mehras. When Soni is in deep thought in her room, a flashback is shown where a woman is teaching her younger version that dark-skinned people are not trustworthy. Some time later, Kartik reaches the Arora's house and bumps into Purnima who was heading to the Mehras. The two finally have a decent conversation. Kartik pacified the Aroras while Purnima successfully invites Soni for prayer at her house. When Kartik was returning home, Shanaya purposefully drops juice on him. She tried to take advantage of him being half-naked but the grandma saved the day.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik Mehra\n* Kavita Ghai<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/kavita-ghai-happy-to-play-mom-onscreen/articleshow/74188256.cms |title= Kavita Ghai happy to play mom onscreen |author=IANS |date= 18 February 2020 |website= |publisher=Times Of India |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> as Soni Mehra, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Kuldeep, Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Geetanjali Mishra<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiaforums.com/article/geetanjali-mishra-joins-poulomi-das-in-star-bharats-show_157872?ri=7&rv=118 |title= Geetanjali Mishra Joins Poulomi Das in Star Bharat's Show |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 7 December 2019 |website= |publisher= India Forums |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> as Beena, Purnima's step-mother\n* Shanaya's grandmother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiaforums.com/article/mohit-chauhan-bags-star-bharats-kartik-purnima_158885 |title= Mohit Chauhan Bags Star Bharat's Kartik Purnima|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 7 January 2020 |website= |publisher=India Forums |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle Mehra / Billo, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet Mehra, Kartik's brother\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{TV Guide|1406470}}\n* {{IMDb title|11590094}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kartik Purnima\n| image                    = \n| genre                    = [[Drama]] ,[[Romance]]\n| channel                  = [[Star Bharat]]\n| creator                  = Bhupinder Singh,  Sanjot Kaur\n| based_on                 = \n| writer                   = Pearl Gray, Raghuvir Shekhawat, Lakshmi Jaykumar\n| director                 = Ravid Gautam\n| creative_director        = \n| starring                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| country                  = [[India]]\n| language                 = [[Hindi language| Hindi]], [[Punjabi language| Punjabi]]\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 45 (as of 27 March 2020)\n| producer                 = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                  = \n| company                  = \n| distributor              = [[Star India]]\n| picture_format           = \n| first_aired              = {{start date|df=yes|2020|2|03}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website            = https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/kartik-purnima/s-2481\n| production_website = \n}}\n\n'''''Kartik Purnima''''' is an Indian Hindi-language social drama television series, which premiered on 3rd February 2020 on [[Star Bharat]]. It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/you-are-born-with-your-colour-and-you-need-to-love-it-poulomi-das/articleshow/73552401.cms |title=Poulomi Das: You are born with your colour and you need to love it! |last= Akash Wadhwa  |first= TNN |date= 24 January 2020 |website= |publisher=Times Of India |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n'''The show is currently halted due to the [[COVID-19]].'''\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iwmbuzz.com/television/celebrities/proud-skin-colour-kartik-purnima-actress-poulami-das/2020/02/05 |title= I'm proud of my skin colour: Poulomi Das |author=Manisha Suthar |date= 5 February 2020 |website= |publisher=IWMBUZZ.com |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her and she wins at 1st place. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya. Purnima also teaches some kids Maths and English.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni is also very diet conscious. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there. Her choice is Kartik and not Sumreet. Beena tries to convince her, but in no vain. Later, Soni questions Kartik about Purnima's book. Later, the family is visiting the temple and Shanaya makes a charade that her foot has been sprained. Shanaya gets rid of Purnima and throws a party at her house,. occasion is her marriage with Kartik. Purnima finds out about this she stops the party and during such she slaps Shanaya. Shanaya makes another charade, making her mother slap Purnima and throws her outside the house. Kuldeep returns the next morning finding Purnima sleeping outside. Kuldeep finds out the truth and as usual Shanaya refuses to apologise. Kartik convinces Soni to go and visit the Aroras. When Soni visits the Aroras, she comes 30 mins beforehand and Purnima mistakenly gets some water on Soni. Soni treats Purnima as a maid (Purnima's father was not at home when this happened). Shanaya is not at home when Soni visits and goes to meet Kartik. Shanaya confesses to Kartik. Beena tells Shanaya about Soni's wish (Shanaya should not take part in Miss Punjab contest) and Shanaya refuses to abide. Shanaya also tells Beena that she confessed to Kartik. Soni fixes Shanaya's and Sumreet's engagement. Kartik and Purnima had a near accident situation where a sobbing Purnima told Kartik that he is a liar. Kartik thinks about this overnight and gets Purnima's information from her eye donation form. He calls Purnima and Shanaya tells the family that her boyfriend called her. Purnima shuts Beena up as she starts questioning her character. Kartik was heading to find Purnima's house and on the way he finds a hurt Kuldeep. Outside the house, Kartik and Purnima bump into each other. Kartik notices his bracelet on Purnima's hand.\n\nSumreet calls Kartik to help him choose a ring for engagement. Kartik asks Sumreet to call Shanaya to ask if Shanaya is happy about the marriage. Shanaya says she is happy thus making Kartik more confused. The females of the families go for shopping for Shanaya's engagement outfit. Soni forgot her wallet and Kartik drops it by. He spots Purnima at the shop choosing some outfits for herself. The outfit is expensive and Purnima cannot afford it. Kartik overhears the shop attendant's comment which was offending and scolds at him. Kartik buys the outfit. Purnima is given a lot of outfits to carry and she slips most of them on Soni. She is forced to apologise and refer to Soni as \"Madam\".

Neil McCormick of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' summarized ''Madame X'' as being \"a mad mishmash of an album\" and criticized its lack of cohesiveness, stating that Madonna was \"fighting on too many fronts at the same time\".<ref name=\"telegraphreview\" /> Similarly, Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''  described the album as being \"admirably bizarre\", remarking that its \"strongest songs\" were buried beneath \"disasters\".<ref name=\"RSReview\" /> In a more critical review, Rich Juzwiak from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' denounced the album as being \"muddled and convoluted\", calling it \"lyrically inarticulate\".<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/>\n\nAt the end of the year, Madame X won an online poll hosted by ''Billboard'' as the best album of 2019.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8546298/top-10-fan-favorite-2019-albums-of-the-year</ref> Various music publications such as ''[[NME]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/features/the-greatest-albums-of-2019-2586777|title=The 50 best albums of 2019|date=2019-12-16|work=[[NME]]|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8545657/best-albums-of-2019-top-50|title=The 50 Best Albums of 2019: Staff Picks|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> and ''[[Slant Magazine]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/features/the-25-best-albums-of-2019/|title=The 25 Best Albums of 2019|last=Staff|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> included ''Madame X'' in their \"Best Albums of 2019\" lists.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Accolades for ''Madame X''\n!Critic/Publication\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |List\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |{{abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n|''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n|75 Best Albums of 2019\n| align=\"center\" |67\n| align=\"center\" |<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yearendlists.com/2019/11/mojo-75-best-albums-of-2019|title=Mojo: 75 Best Albums of 2019|last=|first=|date=September 17, 2019|website=Mojo|access-date=December 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''\n|The 50 Best Albums of 2019\n| align=\"center\" |46\n| align=\"center\" |<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8545657/best-albums-of-2019-top-50|title=The 50 Best Albums of 2019: Staff Picks|last=|first=|date=December 10, 2019|website=Billboard|access-date=December 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|Top 10 Fan-Favorite 2019 Albums\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" |<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8546298/top-10-fan-favorite-2019-albums-of-the-year|title=What's *Your* Favorite Album of 2019?

He was old enough to witness charters in 1148, as was his younger brother [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], which suggests he was born c. 1130-1133, as the male age of majority was fifteen. (H.E. Mayer has suggested a limited degree of competence may have been accepted from the age of eight, reducing his age, but the examples given of this are of males of the royal house, whose situation was somewhat different.) He was probably about ten years older than his youngest brother, [[Balian of Ibelin]].\n\nAfter his father Barisan died in 1150, Helvis married the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|Constable of Jerusalem]], [[Manasses of Hierges]], who was one of the strongest supporters of [[Queen Melisende]] in the power struggle against her son [[King Baldwin III]]. Manasses was exiled in 1152 when Baldwin was victorious in this struggle, allowing Hugh to inherit Ramla from his mother. Hugh took part in the [[Siege of Ascalon]] in 1153, and in 1157 was captured in battle at [[Banias]], being released probably the next year. In 1159 he visited the [[Principality of Antioch]] and met with [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], who had arrived to assert his suzerainty over the principality. In 1163 Hugh married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] (1133 &ndash; 1184/1185), [[Lord of Toron|Lady of Toron]], the former wife of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II de Courtenay, Count of Edessa]], by whom he had no issue. It is possible that Agnes had already been betrothed or married to him before 1157, date some say it was the one of the actual marriage but she married Amalric after Hugh was taken prisoner; Amalric was forced to divorce her before becoming King in 1163. \n\nHugh participated Amalric's [[Crusader invasion of Egypt|expedition to Egypt]] in 1167, and was responsible for building a bridge over the [[Nile]]. The crusaders allied with the sultan against [[Shirkuh]], the general of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] who was also fighting for control of Egypt, and Hugh was sent to protect [[Cairo]] along with the sultan's son Kamil. Hugh was the first crusader ever to see the sultan's palace. At the siege of [[Bilbeis]] during the same Egyptian campaign, according to Ibelin family tradition, Hugh's life was saved by [[Philip of Milly]] after breaking his leg and falling under his horse.<ref>[[Malcolm Barber]], \"The career of Philip of Nablus in the kingdom of Jerusalem,\" in ''The Experience of Crusading, vol. 2: Defining the Crusader Kingdom'', Peter Edbury and Jonathan Phillips, eds.
