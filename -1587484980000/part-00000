Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. It was directed by [[Jon Favreau]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Terrence Howard]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Shaun Toub]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. In the film, following his escape captivity from a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring the character was in development at [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[New Line Cinema]] at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company, were mixed with [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the title character.\n\n''Iron Man'' premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million on its $140 million budget, becoming the [[2008 in film|eighth-highest grossing film of 2008]]. The film was praised by critics for its acting (particularly Downey's), screenplay, direction, visual effects, and action sequences. It was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries]] from his father [[Howard Stark]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit fully charges. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been [[arms trafficking|trafficking arms]] to criminals worldwide and has staged a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Initiative\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg\n|caption1=Downey promoting the film at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n|image2=Terrence Howard, USAF.jpg\n|caption2=Howard preparing for the role by riding an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] flight simulator\n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />An [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]].

Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" /> Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> especially when it came to adding humor to the film.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarkQuote\" /> To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week [[weight training]] and practiced martial arts,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit.

He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"<ref name=\"FavreauFight\" /> Downey earned $500,000 for the role.<ref name=\"DowneyPay\" /> While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by [[Elon Musk]]. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"<ref name=\"Musk\" />\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: [[Terrence Howard]] was announced in the role of Stark's best friend [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]] in October 2006;<ref name=\"HowardCast\" /> Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;<ref name=\"PaltrowCast\" /> and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.<ref name=\"BridgesCast\" /> [[Don Cheadle]] had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CheadleRhodes\" /> Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> He felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> The decision to push him into the background is comparable to [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"sauron\" /> or [[Palpatine]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,<ref name=\"depth\" /> with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The [[Crimson Dynamo]] was also a villain in early drafts of the script.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Favreau felt it was important to include intentional [[in-joke|inside references]] for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the [[call sign]]s of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and including [[Captain America's shield]] in Stark's workshop.<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" />\n\n[[File:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|left|A scale model of the \"Iron Monger\" suit]]\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', built metal and rubber versions of the armor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane),<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"depth\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"sauron\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"PlayaVista\" /> [[Howard Hughes]] was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] was built.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Favreau rejected the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.<ref name=\"trilogy\" />\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"FirstWeeks\" /> The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a {{convert|150|to(-)|200|yd|adj=on}} long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Production designer]] [[J.

He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at [[Olancha]] Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|mph|adj=on}} winds.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] began in mid-April,<ref name=\"EdwardsBegins\" /> and ended on May 2.<ref name=\"EdwardsEnds\" /> Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of [[Point Dume]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],<ref name=\"depth\" /> while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"[[wikt:grease monkey|grease monkey]]\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".<ref name=\"pump\" />\n\nThere was much [[improvization]] in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvization would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.<ref name=\"depth\" /> It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a [[news conference]] on the floor,<ref name=\"pump\" /> and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Bridges described this approach as \"a $200&nbsp;million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.<ref name=\"BridgesImprovisation\" /> The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.<ref name=\"CameoRemoved\" /> An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs and assorted [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] but this was cut due to legal problems with [[Sony Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/14/deleted-iron-man-post-credits-scene-kevin-feige/ |title=Deleted Iron Man post-credits scene references Spider-Man, X-Men |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=September 14, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> He hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''.

He gets real with it \u2013 you'd think you were watching a military thriller\",<ref name=\"Edelstein\" /> while conversely, [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' gave a negative review, claiming \"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show ... [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's [[Girl Friday (idiom)|girl Friday]], who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted\".<ref name=\"Denby\" /> [[IGN]]'s Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as \"the best thing\" in a film that \"functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles\".<ref name=\"Gilchrist\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"|

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. It was directed by [[Jon Favreau]] from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]], and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Terrence Howard]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Shaun Toub]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. In the film, following his escape captivity from a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring the character was in development at [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[New Line Cinema]] at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by [[Stan Winston]]'s company, were mixed with [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the title character.\n\n''Iron Man'' premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million on its $140 million budget, becoming the [[2008 in film|eighth-highest grossing film of 2008]]. The film was praised by critics for its acting (particularly Downey's), screenplay, direction, visual effects, and action sequences. It was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who has inherited the defense contractor [[Stark Industries]] from his father [[Howard Stark]], is in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit fully charges. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been [[arms trafficking|trafficking arms]] to criminals worldwide and has staged a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Initiative\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg\n|caption1=Downey promoting the film at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n|image2=Terrence Howard, USAF.jpg\n|caption2=Howard preparing for the role by riding an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] flight simulator\n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />An [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]]. Director [[Jon Favreau]] felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> and that the actor could not only make Stark a \"likable asshole,\u201d but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]].'' Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" /> Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> especially when it came to adding humor to the film.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarkQuote\" /> To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week [[weight training]] and practiced martial arts,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\"<ref name=\"pump\" />\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]]: <br />A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the [[United States Air Force]] in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|War Machine]] in a sequel.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> Howard prepared for the role by visiting [[Nellis Air Force Base]] on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopters and [[F-22 Raptor]]s.<ref name=\"HowardNellis\" /> While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. \"Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,\u201d Howard said. \"Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?\"<ref name=\"pump\" /> Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child.<ref name=\"RhodesFirst\" /> He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]];'' the two competed physically on set.<ref name=\"HowardCompete\" />\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger]]: <br />Stark's business second-in-command, mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges [[google (verb)|googled]] the [[Book of Obadiah]], and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film.<ref name=\"BridgesCut\" />\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as [[Ho Yinsen]]: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit.<ref name=\"Toub\" /><ref name=\"Yinsen\" />\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts]]: <br />Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\u201d Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way.<ref name=\"Paltrow\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Faran Tahir]] appears as [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]], the leader of the Ten Rings; [[Paul Bettany]] voices [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark's personal [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] system; [[Leslie Bibb]] portrays [[Christine Everhart]], a reporter for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''; and [[Clark Gregg]] appears as [[Phil Coulson]], an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref name=\"IMEbertReview\" /> [[Will Lyman]] provides the voice-over during the opening award ceremony.<ref name=\"Lyman\" /> Director [[Jon Favreau]] plays [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]], Stark's [[bodyguard]] and [[chauffeur]],<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> and [[Samuel L.

It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured [[MODOK]] as the villain. [[Tom Rothman]], President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.<ref name=\"archive\" /> That October, [[Quentin Tarantino]] was approached to write and direct the film.<ref name=\"Tarantino\" /> Fox sold the rights to [[New Line Cinema]] the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \"we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"NewLine\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote= We worked with [[Michael Crichton]]'s researchers to find a grounded realistic way to deal with the suit.

After two years of unsuccessful development, the deal with Cassavetes fell through, and New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.<ref name=\"NewLineScreenplays\" />\n\nIn November 2005, [[Marvel Studios]] worked to start development from scratch,<ref name=\"MarvelDevelopment\" /> and announced ''Iron Man'' as their first independent feature, because the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, \"we went after about 30 writers and they all passed,\u201d saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and the fact that it was solely a Marvel production. When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals.<ref name=\"MCUDocumentary\" /> In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk]], Marvel conducted [[focus group]]s, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to  formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \"Iron Man Advertorials,\u201d and were produced by [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] and [[Blur Studio]].<ref name=\"Adventorials\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nJon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing {{convert|70|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"pump\" /> Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer [[Avi Arad]] on another film after they both worked on ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \"ultimate spy movie\" in ''Iron Man'', citing inspiration from [[Tom Clancy]], [[James Bond]], and ''[[RoboCop]]'',<ref name=\"Inspiration\" /> and compared his approach to an [[independent film]]\u2014\"[i]f [[Robert Altman]] had directed ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''\"\u2014and ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /><ref name=\"sauron\" /> Favreau wanted to make ''Iron Man'' a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed.<ref name=\"FavreauWants\" /> He changed the [[Vietnam War]] origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a [[period piece]].<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]] were hired to write the script,<ref name=\"FavreauMarcumHolloway\" /> while [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby]] wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts,<ref name=\"FergusOstby\" /> and [[John August]] then \"polishing\" the combined version.<ref name=\"August\" /> Comic book staff [[Mark Millar]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Tom Brevoort]], [[Axel Alonso]], and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]] were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" />\n\nFavreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUnknown\" /> However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role.<ref name=\"DowneyCast\" /> Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"<ref name=\"FavreauFight\" /> Downey earned $500,000 for the role.<ref name=\"DowneyPay\" /> While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by [[Elon Musk]]. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"<ref name=\"Musk\" />\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: [[Terrence Howard]] was announced in the role of Stark's best friend [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]] in October 2006;<ref name=\"HowardCast\" /> Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;<ref name=\"PaltrowCast\" /> and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.<ref name=\"BridgesCast\" /> [[Don Cheadle]] had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"CheadleRhodes\" /> Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> He felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> The decision to push him into the background is comparable to [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref name=\"sauron\" /> or [[Palpatine]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"mandarin\" /> Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,<ref name=\"depth\" /> with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The [[Crimson Dynamo]] was also a villain in early drafts of the script.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Favreau felt it was important to include intentional [[in-joke|inside references]] for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the [[call sign]]s of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and including [[Captain America's shield]] in Stark's workshop.<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" />\n\n[[File:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|left|A scale model of the \"Iron Monger\" suit]]\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', built metal and rubber versions of the armor.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\" (Obadiah Stane),<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"depth\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"sauron\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"PlayaVista\" /> [[Howard Hughes]] was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] was built.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Favreau rejected the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.<ref name=\"trilogy\" />\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"FirstWeeks\" /> The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a {{convert|150|to(-)|200|yd|adj=on}} long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.<ref name=\"trilogy\" /> [[Production designer]] [[J. Michael Riva]] saw footage of a [[Taliban]] fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at [[Olancha]] Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|mph|adj=on}} winds.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] began in mid-April,<ref name=\"EdwardsBegins\" /> and ended on May 2.<ref name=\"EdwardsEnds\" /> Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of [[Point Dume]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],<ref name=\"depth\" /> while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"[[wikt:grease monkey|grease monkey]]\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".<ref name=\"pump\" />\n\nThere was much [[improvization]] in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvization would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.<ref name=\"depth\" /> It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a [[news conference]] on the floor,<ref name=\"pump\" /> and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Bridges described this approach as \"a $200&nbsp;million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.<ref name=\"BridgesImprovisation\" /> The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.<ref name=\"thinktank\" /> The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.<ref name=\"CameoRemoved\" /> An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs and assorted [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] but this was cut due to legal problems with [[Sony Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/14/deleted-iron-man-post-credits-scene-kevin-feige/ |title=Deleted Iron Man post-credits scene references Spider-Man, X-Men |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=September 14, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> He hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.<ref name=\"Embassy\" /> To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and skydivers were filmed in a vertical [[wind tunnel]] to study the physics of flying.<ref name=\"WindTunnel\" /> For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.<ref name=\"MarkIIIFlying\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Iron Man (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nComposer [[Ramin Djawadi]] had been a fan of the character [[Iron Man]] as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don't have any superpowers\". After Favreau's previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,<ref name=\"DebneyIM1\" /> Djawadi sought out the role himself.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Favreau had a clear vision of [[heavy metal music]] and guitars for the project,<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero.<ref name=\"DjawadiDoG\" /> Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]],<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> and [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.<ref name=\"Morello\" /> The film also features a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]].<ref name=\"O\" /> A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]] on April 29, 2008.<ref name=\"release\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr-2008.JPG|thumb|upright|Downey promoting the film in [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nMarvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for ''Iron Man'' on that of ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In May 2008, [[Sega]] released an official tie-in [[Iron Man (video game)|video game based on the film]] on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Toub reprise their roles from the film.<ref name=\"VideoGame\" /> A 30-second spot for the film aired during a [[Super Bowl XLII]] break.<ref name=\"SuperBowl\" /> 6,400 [[7-Eleven]] stores in the United States helped promote the film, and [[LG Group]] also made a deal with Paramount.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> [[Hasbro]] created figures of armor from the film, as well as [[Titanium Man]] (who appears in the video game) and the [[Hulkbuster Armor MK II|armor from the ''World War Hulk'' comics]].<ref name=\"Hasbro\" /> Worldwide, [[Burger King]] and [[Audi]] promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as [[Michael Bay]] did for ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"transformers\" /> In the film, Tony Stark drives an [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]], and also has an \"American cheeseburger\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's [[product placement]] deal with the respective companies.

He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, \n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

It was like a blow to the solar plexus. I started seeing all the characters of Victor Hugo's ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''\u2014Valjean, Javert, Gavroche, Cosette, Marius, and \u00c9ponine\u2014in my mind's eye, laughing, crying, and singing onstage.<ref name=\"completebookoflesmis\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Behr (journalist) |title=The Complete Book of Les Mis\u00e9rables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA50 |publisher=[[Arcade Publishing]] |year=1989 |page=50|isbn=9781559701563}}</ref></blockquote>\nHe shared the idea with French composer Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg, and the two developed a rough synopsis and analysis of each character's mental and emotional state, as well as that of an audience. Sch\u00f6nberg then began work on the music, while Boublil the text. According to Boublil, \"I could begin work on the words.

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner. It uses much of the staging and technical work of the 2014 Broadway revival.<ref name=\"US 2017/18 Tour Dates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=331855 |title=Les Miserables - US Tour Schedule |website=BroadwayWorld.com |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== UK and Ireland tours ====\n=====1992\u20131993 Tour=====\nThe first tour of the UK and Ireland opened at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] 14 April 1992<ref name=This_day1>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/april/14 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> with Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert, later replaced by [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]])<ref name=YouTube_Burman>{{cite AV media |people=Manchester cast: Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]] (Javert), Richard Burman (Marius), Sarah Ryan (Cosette), [[Meredith Braun]] (\u00c9ponine), [[Daniel Coll]] (Enjolras), Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), [[Louise Plowright]] (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier) |date=20 November 1992 |title=BBC Children in Need (regional: North West)  | trans-title = One Day More |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN3FGklAlfk |accessdate=12 August 2016 |time= |location=Manchester |publisher=Richard Burman: [[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ria Jones (Fantine), Meredith Braun (\u00c9ponine), Mike Sterling (Marius, later replaced by Richard Burman),<ref name=\"YouTube_Burman\" /> Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), Louise Plowright (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Sarah Ryan (Cosette) and Daniel Coll (Enjolras).<ref name=Telegraph_180492>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Michael |title=Les Miserables - review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 April 1992}}</ref><ref name=Manchester_CD>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Highlights from Les Mis\u00e9rables, Manchester Company |year=1992 |last1=Leyton |first1=Jeff (Jean Valjean) |last2=Quast |first2=Philip (Javert) |last3=Sterling |first3=Mike (Marius) |last4=Braun |first4=Meredith (\u00c9ponine) |last5=Jones |first5=Ria (Fantine) |publisher=First Night Records |asin=B000026YOI |id=Barcode: 5014636503427 |url=http://first-night-records.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&products_id=109}}</ref> The production then moved on to the [[Point Theatre]], Dublin, Ireland, opening 30 June 1993,<ref name=This_day2>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/june/30 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> and then to [[Edinburgh Playhouse|Playhouse, Edinburgh]], Scotland, opening 23 September 1993.<ref name=This_day3>{{cite web |title=What Happened on September 23rd, 1993 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/september/23 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====1997\u20132000 Tour=====\nIn 1997 a second tour began at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], running from 6 May until 14 June,<ref name=UKTW_Plymouth>{{cite web |title=Les Miserables: Theatre Royal, Plymouth |url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Plymouth/Theatre-Royal/Musical/Les-Miserables/L921466477/ |website=uktw.co.uk |publisher=UK Theatre Web |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> the cast featured: Stig Rossen (Jean Valjean), Michael McCarthy (Javert), Julia Worsley (Fantine), Gemma Sandy (\u00c9ponine), Norman Bowman (Marius), Cameron Blakely (Th\u00e9nardier), Cathy Breeze (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Rebecca Vere (Cosette) and Mark O'Malley (Enjolras).<ref name=Plymouth_programme>{{cite book |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables programme: Plymouth |url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/272257057835 |publisher=John Good Holbrook Ltd |year=1997}}</ref> The tour then continued as detailed in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px;\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Cast details\n|-\n!

The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] has been running in London since October 1985, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running musical]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.\n\nSet in early [[France in the nineteenth century|19th-century France]], ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' is the story of [[Jean Valjean]], a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named [[Javert]]. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a [[June Rebellion|revolutionary period]] in France, where a group of [[Friends of the ABC|young idealists]] attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\n==Background==\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was originally released as a French-language [[concept album]], and the first musical-stage adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was presented at the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Behr1993\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55970-156-3 |page=51}}</ref> However, the production closed after three months due to the expiry of the booking contract.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1983, about six months after producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] had opened ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had been impressed by the work and asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. Mackintosh, in conjunction with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version opened in London on 8 October 1985, by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the [[Barbican Centre]], then the London home of the RSC. The success of the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical led to a Broadway production.\n\n==Critical reception and milestones==\n{{See also|Long-running musical theatre productions}}\nCritical reviews for ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' were initially negative. At the opening of the London production, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Francis King described the musical as \"a lurid Victorian melodrama produced with Victorian lavishness\" and Michael Ratcliffe of ''[[The Observer]]'' considered the show \"a witless and synthetic entertainment\", while literary scholars condemned the project for converting classic [[literature]] into a musical.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news |last=Billington |first=Michael |title=Twenty-five years on, they ask me if I was wrong about Les Mis\u00e9rables ... |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/sep/21/les-miserables-25-year-anniversary |publisher=The Guardian Newspaper Online |accessdate=31 January 2013 |location=London |date=21 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Neon Tommy\">{{cite web |last=Kehe |first=Jason |title=Theater Review: \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" At The Ahmanson |url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson |publisher=USC Annenberg |accessdate=31 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619041019/http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Public opinion differed: the box office received record orders.

It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by [[Gustave Brion]], which in turn was based on the drawing by [[\u00c9mile Bayard]]. Bayard's drawing appeared in several of the novel's<!-- Novel or musical? --> earliest French-language editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!--PLOT SHOULD BE OF THE MUSICAL ITSELF. DO NOT ADD DETAILS OF THE NOVEL AND ITS FILM ADAPTATIONS.-->\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labor (\"Work Song\"). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), [[Jean Valjean]], \"prisoner 24601\", is released on [[parole]] by the prison guard [[Javert]]. By law, Valjean must display a yellow [[ticket of leave]], which identifies him as an ex-convict (\"On Parole\"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]] offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, angering a farmer and other merchants as he flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver \"to become an honest man\" and that he has \"bought (Valjean's) soul for God\" (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (\"Valjean's Soliloquy\" / \"What Have I Done?\"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.\n\nEight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. [[Fantine]] is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter [[Cosette]], who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (\"At the End of the Day\"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (\"[[I Dreamed a Dream]]\"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"), and attracts local sailors. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.\n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner. It uses much of the staging and technical work of the 2014 Broadway revival.<ref name=\"US 2017/18 Tour Dates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=331855 |title=Les Miserables - US Tour Schedule |website=BroadwayWorld.com |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== UK and Ireland tours ====\n=====1992\u20131993 Tour=====\nThe first tour of the UK and Ireland opened at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] 14 April 1992<ref name=This_day1>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/april/14 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> with Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert, later replaced by [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]])<ref name=YouTube_Burman>{{cite AV media |people=Manchester cast: Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]] (Javert), Richard Burman (Marius), Sarah Ryan (Cosette), [[Meredith Braun]] (\u00c9ponine), [[Daniel Coll]] (Enjolras), Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), [[Louise Plowright]] (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier) |date=20 November 1992 |title=BBC Children in Need (regional: North West)  | trans-title = One Day More |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN3FGklAlfk |accessdate=12 August 2016 |time= |location=Manchester |publisher=Richard Burman: [[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ria Jones (Fantine), Meredith Braun (\u00c9ponine), Mike Sterling (Marius, later replaced by Richard Burman),<ref name=\"YouTube_Burman\" /> Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), Louise Plowright (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Sarah Ryan (Cosette) and Daniel Coll (Enjolras).<ref name=Telegraph_180492>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Michael |title=Les Miserables - review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 April 1992}}</ref><ref name=Manchester_CD>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Highlights from Les Mis\u00e9rables, Manchester Company |year=1992 |last1=Leyton |first1=Jeff (Jean Valjean) |last2=Quast |first2=Philip (Javert) |last3=Sterling |first3=Mike (Marius) |last4=Braun |first4=Meredith (\u00c9ponine) |last5=Jones |first5=Ria (Fantine) |publisher=First Night Records |asin=B000026YOI |id=Barcode: 5014636503427 |url=http://first-night-records.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&products_id=109}}</ref> The production then moved on to the [[Point Theatre]], Dublin, Ireland, opening 30 June 1993,<ref name=This_day2>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/june/30 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> and then to [[Edinburgh Playhouse|Playhouse, Edinburgh]], Scotland, opening 23 September 1993.<ref name=This_day3>{{cite web |title=What Happened on September 23rd, 1993 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/september/23 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====1997\u20132000 Tour=====\nIn 1997 a second tour began at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], running from 6 May until 14 June,<ref name=UKTW_Plymouth>{{cite web |title=Les Miserables: Theatre Royal, Plymouth |url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Plymouth/Theatre-Royal/Musical/Les-Miserables/L921466477/ |website=uktw.co.uk |publisher=UK Theatre Web |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> the cast featured: Stig Rossen (Jean Valjean), Michael McCarthy (Javert), Julia Worsley (Fantine), Gemma Sandy (\u00c9ponine), Norman Bowman (Marius), Cameron Blakely (Th\u00e9nardier), Cathy Breeze (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Rebecca Vere (Cosette) and Mark O'Malley (Enjolras).<ref name=Plymouth_programme>{{cite book |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables programme: Plymouth |url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/272257057835 |publisher=John Good Holbrook Ltd |year=1997}}</ref> The tour then continued as detailed in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px;\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Cast details\n|-\n!

Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]].

Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]].

When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During the [[February Revolution]], a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm.

They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]].

Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job.

In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union.

On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY.

In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

At the conclusion of the \"Informbiro period\", reforms rendered Yugoslavia considerably more religiously liberal than the [[Eastern Bloc]] states.\n\nIn the first post war years Tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to Moscow, indeed, he was often viewed as second only to Stalin in the Eastern Bloc. In fact, Stalin and Tito had an uneasy alliance from the start, with Stalin considering Tito too independent.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period Tito's Yugoslavia had a strong commitment to orthodox Marxist ideas. Harsh repressive measures against dissidents were common, including \"arrests, show trials, forced collectivisation, suppression of churches and religion\".{{sfn|Forsythe|2009|p=47}} As the leader of Yugoslavia, Tito displayed a fondness for luxury, taking over the royal palaces that had belonged to the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 together with the former palaces used by the House of Habsburg that were located in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=196-197}} Tito's governing style was very monarchical, as his tours across Yugoslavia in the former royal train closely resembled the royal tours of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings and Habsburg emperors, and in Serbia he adopted the traditional royal custom of being a godfather to every 9th son.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito modified the custom by becoming a godfather to every 9th daughter as well after criticism was made that the practice was sexist.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Just like a Serbian king, Tito would appear wherever a 9th child was born to the family to congratulate the parents and give them a gift of cash.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito always spoke very harshly of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings in both public and private (through in private, he sometimes had a kind word for the Habsburgs), but in many ways he appeared to his people as a sort of king.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Tito\u2013Stalin split===\n{{Main|Tito\u2013Stalin split}}\n[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito 1953.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito greeting former U.S. first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her July 1953 visit to Yugoslavia]]\n[[File:Resolucija VII. kongresa o prihodnjih nalogah ZKJ.jpg|thumb|Kardelj, Rankovi\u0107 and Tito in 1958]]\n[[File:Tito in Kumrovec, 1961.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito visiting his birthplace [[Kumrovec]] in 1961]]\n\nUnlike other states in east-central Europe liberated by allied forces, Yugoslavia liberated itself from Axis domination with limited direct support from the [[Red Army]]. Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons to recognise Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.at/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=soviet+spy+ring+yugoslav+party+1945&source=bl&ots=dIXuH8A3Lq&sig=WWgnE0DnV6KfklOSYccGita4xHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoq7bWgb3fAhVHzKQKHQmsCu8Q6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=soviet%20spy%20ring%20yugoslav%20party%201945&f=false|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|last=West|first=Richard|date=2012-11-15|publisher=Faber|isbn=9780571281107|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=12 The Quarrel with Stalin}}</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents occurred between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

Stalin took the matter personally and arranged several assassination attempts on Tito, none of which succeeded. In a correspondence between the two leaders, Tito openly wrote:\n\n{{quote|Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

This repression was not limited to known and alleged Stalinists, but also included members of the Communist Party or anyone exhibiting sympathy towards the Soviet Union. Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

An often disputed, but relatively feasible number that was put forth by the Yugoslav government itself in 1964 places the number of Goli Otok inmates incarcerated between 1948 and 1956 to be 16,554, with less than 600 having died during detention. The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

It has, for example, been given as one of the reasons for the [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]] in Czechoslovakia, in which 14 high-level Communist officials were purged, with 11 of them being executed. Stalin put pressure on Czechoslovakia to conduct purges in order to discourage the spread of the idea of a \"national path to socialism,\" which Tito espoused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|title=Film, discussion to focus on 1952 Slansky trials|accessdate=2013-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615165940/http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Non-Alignment===\n{{See also|Non-Aligned Movement}}\n{{See also|Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement}}\n[[File:Yugoslav passport Josip Broz Tito 1973.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Tito's diplomatic passport, 1973]]\n\n[[File:TitoCarter19783.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|U.S.-Yugoslav summit, 1978]]\nUnder Tito's leadership, Yugoslavia became a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]].

His position as a party whip and Tito's way of controlling and monitoring the government and, to a certain extent the people, bothered many, especially the younger, newer generation of government officials who were working towards a more liberal Yugoslav society.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions. Control of education, healthcare, and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903055-1,00.html|title=Tito's Daring Experiment|work=Time |date=9 August 1971|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTito's greatest strength, in the eyes of the western communists,<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Laurence |title=Serbia |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2010 |page=23 |isbn=978-1841623269}}</ref> had been in suppressing nationalist insurrections and maintaining unity throughout the country.

Tito was just shy of his 60th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] as the best man.

Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at [[Beli Dvor]], where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by the latter pair.

Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\">{{cite book|last1=Badurina|first1=Berislav|last2=Sara\u010devi\u0107|first2=Sead|last3=Grobenski|first3=Valent|last4=Eterovi\u0107|first4=Ivo|last5=Tudor|first5=Mladen|title=Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom|publisher=Vjesnik|year=1980|page=102}}</ref> Tito's reputation as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders of [[World War II]], along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], was primarily the cause of the favourable international recognition.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\"/>\n\n===Domestic awards===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Yugoslavian Great Star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden slobode.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Hero of socialist labour Rib.png|width=104}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National liberation Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Battle flag Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden jugoslovenske zastave1(traka).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the partisan star with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order Republic Golden wreath RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of merits for the people with golden star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the brotherhood and unity with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National army with laurer wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of military merits with the great star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order for courageousness Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941 RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal RIB.png|width=106}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Order of the People's Hero]] {{smallsup|a}}\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Yugoslav Great Star]]\n|[[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]]\n|[[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]]\n|[[Order of National Liberation]]\n|[[Order of the War Flag]]\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Sash]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|[[Order of the Partisan Star with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the Republic with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of People's Merit]]\n|[[Order of Brotherhood and Unity with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the People's Army with Laurel Wreath]]\n|[[Order of Military Merit with Great Star]]\n|-\n!4th Row\n|[[Order of Courage (Yugoslavia)|Order of Courage]]\n|[[Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941]]\n|[[10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 1:</small> <sup>a</sup>'''<small>Awarded 3 times.</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 2:</small>''' <small>All Yugoslav decorations are now defunct.</small>\n|}\n\n===Foreign awards===\nHere follows a short list including some of the more notable foreign awards and decorations of Tito.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Award or decoration\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Place\n! style=\"width:500px;\"| Note\n!

Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]. At the time it was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful 1944 [[Nazis|Nazi]] attempt on his life. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and attacked him on that day.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=43}}}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Despite there being \"not the slightest doubt\" about the date and location of Tito's birth, many people in all parts of the former Yugoslavia give credence to various rumours about his origins.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=42}}}}\n\nHe was the seventh or eighth child of Franjo Broz (1860\u20131936) and Marija n\u00e9e Javer\u0161ek (1864\u20131918). His parents had already had a number of children die in early infancy.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=44}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=44}} Broz was christened and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=45}} His father, Franjo, was a [[Croats|Croat]] whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] from the village of [[Podsreda]]. The villages were {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} apart, and his parents had married on 21 January 1881. Franjo Broz had inherited a {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer\u0161ek. By the time he returned to Kumrovec to begin school, he spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]] better than [[Croatian language|Croatian]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} and had learned to play the piano.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} Despite his \"mixed parentage\", Broz identified as a Croat like his father and neighbours.{{sfn|Minahan|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Lee|1993|p=9}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1976|p=218}}\n\nIn July 1900,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec. He completed four years of school,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} failing the 2nd grade and graduating in 1905.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}} As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life Tito was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle, and then on his parents' family farm.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage.{{sfn|West|1995|p=32}} \n\nInstead, aged 15 years, Broz left Kumrovec and travelled about {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} south to [[Sisak]], where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]]. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Broz paid for it himself.

Broz was arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned in the [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in present-day [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=62}} Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} After his acquittal and release,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=62\u201363}} his regiment served briefly on the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Front]] before being deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in early 1915 to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Tito in his own account of his military service did not mention that he participated in the failed Austrian invasion of Serbia, instead giving the misleading impression that he fought only in Galicia, as it would have offended Serbian opinion to know that he fought in 1914 for the Habsburgs against them.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} On one occasion, the [[Reconnaissance|scout]] [[platoon]] he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive.

One of them rammed his two-yard, iron-tipped, double-pronged lance into my back just below the left arm. I fainted.

When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During the [[February Revolution]], a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at [[Yekaterinburg]], then caught another train that reached [[Omsk]] in [[Siberia]] on 8 November after a {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} journey.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=67\u201368}} At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn Omsk the train was stopped by local Bolsheviks who told Broz that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had seized control of Petrograd. They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West states that the marriage occurred in mid-1919.{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}}}} At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=76}} Broz later wrote that during his time in Russia he heard much talk of Lenin, a little of Trotsky and \"...as for Stalin, during the time I stayed in Russia, I never once heard his name\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}} In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to [[Narva]], by ship to [[Szczecin|Stettin]], then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to [[Jastrebarsko]] near Zagreb.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}} Sources differ over whether Broz joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=77}}\n\n==Interwar communist activity==\n===Communist agitator===\n[[File:Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 wiki photo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the Minister of the Interior, Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, led to the outlawing of the Communist Party.|alt=black and white photograph of a male in formal attire]]\nUpon his return home, Broz was unable to gain employment as a metalworker in Kumrovec, so he and his wife moved briefly to Zagreb, where he worked as a waiter, and took part in a waiter's strike.

Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job. So, at the age of 33, Broz became a professional revolutionary.{{sfn|West|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=83\u201385}}\n\n===Professional revolutionary===\nThe CPY concentrated its revolutionary efforts on factory workers in the more industrialised areas of Croatia and Slovenia, encouraging strikes and similar action.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=87}} In 1925, the now unemployed Broz moved to [[Kraljevica]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, where he started working at a shipyard to further the aims of the CPY.{{sfn|Auty|1970|p=53}} During his time in Karljevica, Tito acquired a love of the warm, sunny Adriatic coastline that was to last for the rest of his life, and throughout his later time as leader, he spent as much time possible living on his yacht while cruising the Adriatic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=55}} \n\nWhile at Kraljevica he worked on Yugoslav [[torpedo boat]]s and a pleasure yacht for the [[People's Radical Party]] politician, [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]]. Broz built up the trade union organisation in the shipyards and was elected as a [[union representative]]. A year later he led a shipyard strike, and soon after was fired. In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union. In July 1927 Broz was arrested, along with six other workers, and imprisoned at nearby [[Ogulin]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=88\u201389}} After being held without trial for some time, Broz went on a hunger strike until a date was set. The trial was held in secret and he was found guilty of being a member of the CPY. Sentenced to four months' imprisonment, he was released from prison pending an appeal. On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY. During the conference, Broz condemned factions within the party. These included those that advocated a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda within Yugoslavia, like the long-term CPY leader, the Serb [[Sima Markovi\u0107]]. Broz proposed that the executive committee of the [[Communist International]] purge the branch of factionalism, and was supported by a delegate sent from Moscow. After it was proposed that the entire central committee of the Croatian branch be dismissed, a new central committee was elected with Broz as its secretary.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=95\u201396}} Markovi\u0107 was subsequently expelled from the CPY at the Fourth Congress of the [[Comintern]], and the CPY adopted a policy of working for the break-up of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=96}} Broz arranged to disrupt a meeting of the [[Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party|Social-Democratic Party]] on May Day that year, and in a melee outside the venue, Broz was arrested by the police. They failed to identify him, charging him under his false name for a breach of the peace. He was imprisoned for 14 days and then released, returning to his previous activities.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=96\u201397}} The police eventually tracked him down with the help of a police informer. He was ill-treated and held for three months before being tried in court in November 1928 for his illegal communist activities,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=98\u201399}} which included allegations that the bombs that had been found at his address had been planted by the police.{{sfn|West|1995|p=57}} He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=101}}\n\n===Prison===\n[[File:Tito i Mo\u0161a Pijade u zatvoru.jpg|thumb|Tito (left) and his ideological mentor [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] while in the Lepoglava jail|alt=a black and white photograph of two men]]\n\nAfter his sentencing, his wife and son returned to Kumrovec, where they were looked after by sympathetic locals, but then one day they suddenly left without explanation and returned to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=102\u2013103}} She fell in love with another man and \u017darko grew up in institutions.{{sfn|West|1995|p=59}} After arriving at [[Lepoglava prison]], Broz was employed in maintaining the electrical system, and chose as his assistant a middle-class Belgrade Jew, [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]], who had been given a 20-year sentence for his communist activities. Their work allowed Broz and Pijade to move around the prison, contacting and organising other communist prisoners.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} During their time together in Lepoglava, Pijade became Broz's ideological mentor.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|pp=36\u201339}} After two and a half years at Lepoglava, Broz was accused of attempting to escape and was transferred to [[Maribor]] prison where he was held in solitary confinement for several months.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=106}} After completing the full term of his sentence, he was released, only to be arrested outside the prison gates and taken to Ogulin to serve the four-month sentence he had avoided in 1927. He was finally released from prison on 16 March 1934, but even then he was subject to orders that required him to live in Kumrovec and report to the police daily.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=107\u2013108 & 112}} During his imprisonment, the political situation in Europe had changed significantly, with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany and the emergence of right-wing parties in France and neighbouring Austria. He returned to a warm welcome in Kumrovec, but did not stay for long. In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

Stalin took the matter personally and arranged several assassination attempts on Tito, none of which succeeded. In a correspondence between the two leaders, Tito openly wrote:\n\n{{quote|Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

This repression was not limited to known and alleged Stalinists, but also included members of the Communist Party or anyone exhibiting sympathy towards the Soviet Union. Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

It has, for example, been given as one of the reasons for the [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]] in Czechoslovakia, in which 14 high-level Communist officials were purged, with 11 of them being executed.

In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]].

Tito had an especially close friendship with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia who preached an eccentric mixture of monarchism, Buddhism, and socialism and like Tito wanted his country to be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} Tito saw Sihanouk as something of a kindred soul who like him had to struggle to maintain his backward country's neutrality in face of rival power blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} By contrast, Tito had a strong dislike of President Idi Amin of Uganda whom he saw as a thuggish and possibly insane leader.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=284}}\n\nBecause of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] governments.

In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia's course by the force of their arguments (implying an abandonment of Leninist orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism).<ref name=\"Payne\">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley |title=Spain: A Unique History |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=2011 |page=227 |isbn=978-0299249335}}</ref> The [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000 after the removal of Rankovi\u0107. Some historians argue that this shift from Communist orthodoxy and strong centralised government control to Communist liberalism and a more open, decentralised society played a role in the eventual break-up of the country.\n\nOn 1 January 1967, Yugoslavia was the first communist country to open its borders to all foreign visitors and abolish visa requirements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843306,00.html|title=Beyond Dictatorship |work=Time |date=20 January 1967|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> In the same year Tito became active in promoting a peaceful resolution of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions. Control of education, healthcare, and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903055-1,00.html|title=Tito's Daring Experiment|work=Time |date=9 August 1971|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTito's greatest strength, in the eyes of the western communists,<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Laurence |title=Serbia |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2010 |page=23 |isbn=978-1841623269}}</ref> had been in suppressing nationalist insurrections and maintaining unity throughout the country.

In the 1970s, uncontrolled growth often created chronic inflation, both of which Tito and the party were unable to fully stabilise or moderate. Yugoslavia also paid high interest on loans compared to the [[LIBOR]] rate, but Tito's presence eased investor's fears, since he had proven willing and able to implement unpopular reforms.

Tito was just shy of his 60th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito objected to her energetic personality. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at [[Beli Dvor]], where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.\n\nTito's grandchildren include [[Sa\u0161a Broz]], a theatre director in Croatia; [[Svetlana Broz]], a cardiologist and writer in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and [[Josip Broz Jo\u0161ka|Josip Broz \u2013 Jo\u0161ka]], [[Edvard Broz]] and [[Natali Klasevski]], an artisan of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nAs the [[President of Yugoslavia|President]], Tito had access to extensive (state-owned) property associated with the office, and maintained a lavish lifestyle. In Belgrade he resided in the official residence, the [[Beli dvor]], and maintained a separate private home. The [[Brijuni islands]] were the site of the State Summer Residence from 1949 on. The pavilion was designed by [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]], and included a zoo. Close to 100 foreign heads of state were to visit Tito at the island residence, along with film stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Carlo Ponti]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\nAnother residence was maintained at [[Lake Bled]], while the grounds at [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo (Ba\u010dka Palanka)|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] were the site of \"diplomatic hunts\".

The hypothesis that \"a non-Yugoslav, perhaps a Russian or a Pole\" assumed Tito's identity was included with a note that this had happened during or before the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Yugoslav President Tito Really a Yugoslav?|journal=Cryptologic Spectrum|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|id=(b) (3)-P.L. 86-36|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130906/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The report notes [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s impressions of Tito's Russian origins after he had personally spoken with Tito.\n\nHowever, the NSA's report was completely invalidated by Croatian experts.

For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me. But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party. Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed. Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\">{{cite book|last1=Badurina|first1=Berislav|last2=Sara\u010devi\u0107|first2=Sead|last3=Grobenski|first3=Valent|last4=Eterovi\u0107|first4=Ivo|last5=Tudor|first5=Mladen|title=Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom|publisher=Vjesnik|year=1980|page=102}}</ref> Tito's reputation as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders of [[World War II]], along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], was primarily the cause of the favourable international recognition.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\"/>\n\n===Domestic awards===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Yugoslavian Great Star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden slobode.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Hero of socialist labour Rib.png|width=104}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National liberation Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Battle flag Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden jugoslovenske zastave1(traka).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the partisan star with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order Republic Golden wreath RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of merits for the people with golden star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the brotherhood and unity with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National army with laurer wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of military merits with the great star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order for courageousness Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941 RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal RIB.png|width=106}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Order of the People's Hero]] {{smallsup|a}}\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Yugoslav Great Star]]\n|[[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]]\n|[[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]]\n|[[Order of National Liberation]]\n|[[Order of the War Flag]]\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Sash]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|[[Order of the Partisan Star with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the Republic with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of People's Merit]]\n|[[Order of Brotherhood and Unity with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the People's Army with Laurel Wreath]]\n|[[Order of Military Merit with Great Star]]\n|-\n!4th Row\n|[[Order of Courage (Yugoslavia)|Order of Courage]]\n|[[Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941]]\n|[[10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 1:</small> <sup>a</sup>'''<small>Awarded 3 times.</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 2:</small>''' <small>All Yugoslav decorations are now defunct.</small>\n|}\n\n===Foreign awards===\nHere follows a short list including some of the more notable foreign awards and decorations of Tito.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Award or decoration\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Place\n! style=\"width:500px;\"| Note\n!

{"title_page": "Government Center, Boston", "text_new": "[[File:Government Center Boston aerial 2016.JPG|thumb|right|350px|View of Government Center from the [[Custom House Tower]]]]\n'''Government Center''' is an area in [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], centered on [[City Hall Plaza (Boston)|City Hall Plaza]]. Formerly the site of [[Scollay Square]], it is now the location of [[Boston City Hall]], courthouses, state and federal office buildings, and a major [[MBTA]] [[MBTA subway|subway]] station, also called [[Government Center station (MBTA)|Government Center]].  Its development was controversial, as the project displaced thousands of residents and razed several hundred homes and businesses.\n\n==Major structures==\n\n===Boston City Hall===\n[[File:Boston City Hall 5.JPG|thumb|Boston City Hall]]\n\nThe dominant feature of Government Center is the enormous, imposing, and [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] [[Boston City Hall]],<ref>Southworth & Southworth. AIA Guide to Boston, 3rd ed. 2008; p.52.</ref>  designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood and built in the 1960s as part of Boston's first large [[urban renewal]] scheme. While considered by some to have architectural merit, the building is not universally admired, and is sharply unpopular among locals. Furthermore, it is resented for having replaced the Victorian architecture of Boston's Scollay Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Scollay Square|url=http://bambinomusical.com/Scollay/History.html|website=BambinoMusical.com|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> a lively commercial district that lapsed into squalor in the twentieth century.<ref>Mapping Boston, Krieger, Alex, ed., MIT Press 1999, p.163-165.

Kennedy Federal Building|John Fitzgerald Kennedy Federal Building]] is a United States government office building. It is located across City Hall Plaza from Boston City Hall. An example of 1960s modern architecture, it consists of two 26 floor towers that sit on-axis to each other and a low rise building of four floors that connects to the two towers via an enclosed glass corridor. The two towers stand at a height of {{convert|118|m|ft|sp=us}}.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===City Hall Plaza===\n[[File:Boston City Hall 01.jpg|thumb|City Hall Plaza, circa 1968]]\n[[Boston City Hall Plaza|City Hall Plaza]] is not a well-loved space, either. As Bill Wasik wrote in 2006, \"It is as if the space were calibrated to render futile any gathering, large or small, attempted anywhere on its arid expanse. All the nearby buildings seem to be facing away, making the plaza's {{convert|11|acre|m2}} of concrete and brick feel like the world's largest back alley. \u2026 [It is] so devoid of benches, greenery, and other signposts of human hospitality that even on the loveliest fall weekend, when the [[Boston Common (park)|Common]] and Esplanade and other public spaces teem with Bostonians at leisure, the plaza stands utterly empty save for the occasional skateboarder\u2026\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wasik|first1=Bill|title=And Then There's This: How Stories Live and Die in Viral Culture|date=2009|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0670020843|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/andthentheresthi00wasi}}</ref>  The plaza is often colloquially referred to as \"the brick desert.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulam|first1=Alex|title=Softening Boston's City Hall|url=http://archpaper.com/2014/03/softening-bostons-city-hall/|website=The Architect's Newspaper|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Government Service Center===\n[[File:2010_NewChardonSt_Boston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Government Service Center (Boston)|Government Service Center]]]]\n\nAnother very large Brutalist building at Government Center, less prominently located and thus less well known than City Hall, is the [[Government Service Center (Boston)|Government Service Center]], designed by architect [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The building is unfinished as the tall central tower in the original plan was never built. In the mid-1990s, the adjacent space was filled with the [[Edward W. Brooke]] Courthouse, which houses a division of the [[Boston Municipal Court]]. This irregularly shaped, sloping lot was the last parcel to be developed of the Government Center urban renewal plan; in the interim the space was used as [[parking lot|surface parking]].  In a 2014 article, architectural historian Timothy M. Rohan praised the building for having \"a wondrous interior courtyard like something from baroque Rome, a space that even in its incomplete and neglected state contrasts sharply with nearby City Hall and its alienating plaza.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rohan|first1=Timothy M.|title=The dream behind Boston's forbidding Government Service Center|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/09/07/the-dream-behind-boston-forbidding-government-service-center/zmTu4rsTtcfTqQKjy8sbtO/story.html|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Government Center Garage===\nThis 2,300-space privately owned garage<ref>{{cite web|title=Government Center Garage|url=http://www.governmentcentergarage.com/|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> was built as part of the Government Center urban renewal project.

Formerly the site of [[Scollay Square]], it is now the location of [[Boston City Hall]], courthouses, state and federal office buildings, and a major [[MBTA]] [[MBTA subway|subway]] station, also called [[Government Center station (MBTA)|Government Center]].  Its development was controversial, as the project displaced thousands of residents and razed several hundred homes and businesses.\n\n==Major structures==\n\n===Boston City Hall===\n[[File:Boston City Hall 5.JPG|thumb|Boston City Hall]]\n\nThe dominant feature of Government Center is the enormous, imposing, and [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] [[Boston City Hall]],<ref>Southworth & Southworth. AIA Guide to Boston, 3rd ed. 2008; p.52.</ref>  designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Wood and built in the 1960s as part of Boston's first large [[urban renewal]] scheme. While considered by some to have architectural merit, the building is not universally admired, and is sharply unpopular among locals. Furthermore, it is resented for having replaced the Victorian architecture of Boston's Scollay Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Scollay Square|url=http://bambinomusical.com/Scollay/History.html|website=BambinoMusical.com|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> a lively commercial district that lapsed into squalor in the twentieth century.<ref>Mapping Boston, Krieger, Alex, ed., MIT Press 1999, p.163-165.

Kennedy Federal Building|John Fitzgerald Kennedy Federal Building]] is a United States government office building. It is located across City Hall Plaza from Boston City Hall. An example of 1960s modern architecture, it consists of two 26 floor towers that sit on-axis to each other and a low rise building of four floors that connects to the two towers via an enclosed glass corridor. The two towers stand at a height of {{convert|118|m|ft|sp=us}}.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===City Hall Plaza===\n[[File:Boston City Hall 01.jpg|thumb|City Hall Plaza, circa 1968]]\n[[Boston City Hall Plaza|City Hall Plaza]] is not a well-loved space, either. As Bill Wasik wrote in 2006, \"It is as if the space were calibrated to render futile any gathering, large or small, attempted anywhere on its arid expanse. All the nearby buildings seem to be facing away, making the plaza's {{convert|11|acre|m2}} of concrete and brick feel like the world's largest back alley. \u2026 [It is] so devoid of benches, greenery, and other signposts of human hospitality that even on the loveliest fall weekend, when the [[Boston Common (park)|Common]] and Esplanade and other public spaces teem with Bostonians at leisure, the plaza stands utterly empty save for the occasional skateboarder\u2026\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wasik|first1=Bill|title=And Then There's This: How Stories Live and Die in Viral Culture|date=2009|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0670020843|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/andthentheresthi00wasi}}</ref>  The plaza is often colloquially referred to as \"the brick desert.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulam|first1=Alex|title=Softening Boston's City Hall|url=http://archpaper.com/2014/03/softening-bostons-city-hall/|website=The Architect's Newspaper|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Government Service Center===\n[[File:2010_NewChardonSt_Boston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Government Service Center (Boston)|Government Service Center]]]]\n\nAnother very large Brutalist building at Government Center, less prominently located and thus less well known than City Hall, is the [[Government Service Center (Boston)|Government Service Center]], designed by architect [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The building is unfinished as the tall central tower in the original plan was never built. In the mid-1990s, the adjacent space was filled with the [[Edward W. Brooke]] Courthouse, which houses a division of the [[Boston Municipal Court]]. This irregularly shaped, sloping lot was the last parcel to be developed of the Government Center urban renewal plan; in the interim the space was used as [[parking lot|surface parking]].  In a 2014 article, architectural historian Timothy M. Rohan praised the building for having \"a wondrous interior courtyard like something from baroque Rome, a space that even in its incomplete and neglected state contrasts sharply with nearby City Hall and its alienating plaza.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rohan|first1=Timothy M.|title=The dream behind Boston's forbidding Government Service Center|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/09/07/the-dream-behind-boston-forbidding-government-service-center/zmTu4rsTtcfTqQKjy8sbtO/story.html|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Government Center Garage===\nThis 2,300-space privately owned garage<ref>{{cite web|title=Government Center Garage|url=http://www.governmentcentergarage.com/|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> was built as part of the Government Center urban renewal project.
