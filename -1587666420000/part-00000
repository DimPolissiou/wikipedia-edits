The resort was developed by the Spackman family, who owned it from 1926 to 2008. The park was then sold to Morgan RV LLC, who sold it to Apex Parks Group in 2015. Apex announced Indiana Beach's closure in February 2020. Following Apex Parks' bankruptcy in April 2020, the park's social media began teasing a possible reopening, with an announcement on April 23rd that the park would be open for the 2020 season.\n\n== History ==\nOriginally named Ideal Beach, the [[amusement park]] began as a small lakeside beach with a bath house and refreshment stand. In 1927, the first thrill attraction opened, and from that point, it began to expand.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/life/2016/07/04/indiana-beach-new-beginning/86153880/|title=For Indiana Beach, a new beginning|last=Grady|first=Danielle|date=July 4, 2016|website=IndyStar|access-date=}}</ref> In the 1930s and 1940s, it was popular for the Ideal Beach Ballroom, featuring well-known bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianabeach.com/pages/indianabeach_history#|title=Indiana Beach Amusement Resort: History|last=|first=|date=|website=Indiana Beach|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101012642/http://www.indianabeach.com/pages/indianabeach_history|archive-date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=October 28, 2013}}</ref> In February 2008, it was announced that both the amusement park and Indiana Beach campgrounds had been sold to Morgan RV LLC.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2013/12/29/worries-grow-about-indiana-beach-future/4244841/|title=Worries grow about Indiana Beach future|last=Livingston|first=Mikel|date=December 29, 2013|website=IndyStar|access-date=}}</ref> On September 1, 2015, it was announced that the park had been sold to Apex Parks Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/03/06/indiana-beachs-new-owner-overhauling-amusement-park/81418512/|title=Indiana Beach\u2019s new owner overhauling amusement park|last=AP|first=|date=March 6, 2016|website=IndyStar|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screamscape.com/html/indiana_beach.htm|title=Indiana Beach|last=|first=|date=|website=www.screamscape.com|access-date=February 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 18, 2020, Indiana Beach announced that it would permanently close after 94 years of operation, with no plans to reopen. Apex Parks Group cited financial reasons for the closure and said they had \u201cworked diligently\u201d to find a new buyer for the park but were not successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wlfi.com/content/news/Indiana-Beach-closes-gates-567980101.html|title=Indiana Beach Closes After Nearly a Century|last=AP|first=|date=February 18, 2020|website=[[WLFI]]|access-date=February 18, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> In addition to dozens of seasonal workers, Indiana Beach employed 27 people in administrative and maintenance positions.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[K\u00f6penick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[L\u00fcbars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schm\u00f6ckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]].

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture in Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:20190113 Berlin 0510.jpg|thumb|View of [[Gendarmenmarkt]], with the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] to the right and the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] in the back]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung'').

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture in Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:20190113 Berlin 0510.jpg|thumb|View of [[Gendarmenmarkt]], with the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] to the right and the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] in the back]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung'').

ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the war in [[Rhodesia]] can be traced to the conquest of the region by the [[British South Africa Company]] in the late 19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=37}}</ref> Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full [[dominion]] status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923.\n\nIn his famous \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule.<ref name=wessels6873/> But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos [[Congo Crisis|as had resulted]] in the former [[Belgian Congo]] after its independence in 1960.<ref name=\"wessels6873\">{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|pp=68\u201373}}</ref>\n\nBritain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) on 11 November 1965.

Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibanda|2005\n|p=321}}</ref> ZANU and its military wing [[ZANLA]] were headed by [[Robert Mugabe]] and consisted primarily of [[Shona language|Shona]] tribes.

Having previously witnesses the communist redistribution of resources after the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau Rebellion]], Rhodesians refused to allow the majority-rule policy to come into effect. Much of the Rhodesian economy as well as the land was controlled by white Rhodesians, and, fearing total confiscation by either the ZIPRA or ZANLA, the RF elected to hold onto the unofficial minority-rule. In ignoring other contributing factors to the conflict, Smith and the RF were able to strengthen ties with the West, however, Britain remained neutral. The division between the communists and anti-communists caused the fighting to spill over the Rhodesian borders. Neighboring African nations, supported primarily by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, utilized communist material support to begin launching guerrilla attacks on the RF.\n\nThe United States took the official position that it would not recognize Rhodesia as an independent sovereign. However, many American soldiers who had seen combat in Vietnam quickly joined into the Rhodesian Front. The RF created advertising campaigns in order to attract soldiers from Western countries, and the RF amassed a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers that were highly trained in special forces and guerrilla warfare, bringing the total RF military force to over 10,000 men. Many of the professional American soldiers entering the RF directly into the force became de facto members of the Rhodesian government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vvaveteran.org/32-2/32-2_rhodesia.html|title=The VVA Veteran, a publication of Vietnam Veterans of America|website=vvaveteran.org|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union became extremely invested in the Rhodesian Bush War.

The Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the Whites) on behalf of the whole population (including the Black majority) against several externally financed parties made up of predominantly Black [[Radicalization|radicals]] and communists. The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.<ref name=\"binda48\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, in the person of the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]], had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the [[British South Africa Company]] and granted [[self-governing colony|self-governing status]] to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of Whites. Ian Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] party was elected to power in 1962 and [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.<ref name=\"binda48\"/>\n\nThe Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the [[rule of law]] and democracy by fighting Communists, but it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs, not the ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, whom it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.<ref name=\"wood2008542\">{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|pp=542\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978\u20131979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an \"Internal Settlement\" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and arranged multiracial elections, which were held [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|in 1979]] and won by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who became the country's first Black head of government. Unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.\n\nThe war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. The UK Government held another election [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]] to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by [[Robert Mugabe]], was recognised internationally, and the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Belligerents==\n\n===Rhodesian Security Forces===\n{{main|Rhodesian Security Forces}}\n[[File:Rhodesian African Rifles, Lake Kariba, December 1976, 3.png|thumb|upright|Two soldiers of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] aboard a patrol boat on [[Lake Kariba]], December 1976.

While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the [[Rhodesian SAS]] and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978\u20131979 the rest was majority black.<ref name=\"lohman3\">{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military [[British South Africa Police]] of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as a type of home guard.<ref name=\"lohman3\"/>\n\nThe war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the [[Selous Scouts]] and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. The [[Rhodesian Army]] fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.<ref name=\"abbott17\">{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"binda186188\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBy 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent [[Vietnam War]] experience.<ref name=\"abbott17\"/><ref name=\"binda186188\"/>\n\nConsidering the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|arms embargo]], the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian [[FN FAL]] Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the [[H&K G3]] rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[bolt-action]] rifle were used by reservists and the [[British South Africa Police]]. Other weapons included the [[Bren]] LMG in both .303\" and 7.62mm NATO, [[Sten]] SMG, [[Uzi]], [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, Colt [[M16 rifle]] (very late in the war), [[FN MAG]] (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, [[L16 81mm Mortar|81 mm mortar]], and [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore]] mines. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]], Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as \"sanction-busting\".<ref name=smith109116/> South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.\n\nThe [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the [[World War II]] vintage [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transport aircraft and the British [[de Havilland Vampire]]. The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966. The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, the [[Cessna Skymaster]] as well as [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]] (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the [[Bell 205|Agusta Bell 205]].<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use a few Agusta Bell [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brent|1987|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as [[Eland Mk7|Eland armoured cars]] were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made [[T-55]] tanks destined for [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war.<ref name=\"bindaQuartz\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=462\u2013472}}</ref> The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled [[MRAP|mine-proofed armoured vehicles]], often using Mercedes [[Unimog]], [[Land Rover]] and [[Bedford trucks|Bedford]] truck components, including unlicensed copies of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[UR-416]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid-Daly|Stiff|1983|p=425}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying [[submachine gun]]s. A [[siege mentality]] set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.\n\nThe Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), [[Harare|Salisbury]] and District (\"SALOPS\").\n{{clear}}\n\n===Nationalist guerrilla forces===\nThe two major armed groups campaigning against [[Ian Smith]]'s government were the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians. To ensure local domination, ZANLA and ZIPRA sometimes fought against each other as well as against the security forces.<ref name=bennett/>\n\n====ZANLA====\n{{Main|Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army}}\nZANLA was the armed wing of ZANU.<ref name=\"binda48\"/> The organisation also had strong links with [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, [[FRELIMO]]. ZANLA, in the end, was present on a more or less permanent basis in over half the country, as evidenced by the location of the demobilisation bases at the end of the war, which were in every province except [[Matabeleland North]].<ref name=\"demobbases\">{{Harvnb|Martin|Johnson|1981|p=321}}</ref> In addition, they were fighting a civil war against ZIPRA, despite the formation of a joint front by their political parties after 1978.<ref name=bennett/> It was ZANLA's intention to occupy the ground, supplant the administration in rural areas, and then mount the final conventional campaign. ZANLA concentrated on the politicisation of the rural areas using force, persuasion, ties of kinship and collaboration with spirit mediums.<ref name=\"kriger51\">{{Harvnb|Kriger|2003|p=51}}</ref>\n\nZANLA tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank [[land mine]]s on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day).<ref name=\"woodsummary\">{{cite news |title=Rhodesian Insurgency |last=Wood |first=J.

In contrast to ZANLA's [[Mozambique]] links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards [[Zambia]] for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]'' (the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] of South Africa) and South-West African [[SWAPO]] fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because [[ZAPU]]'s political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] Viscount aeroplanes, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|on 3 September 1978]] and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|12 February 1979]]. Using [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport.<ref name=viscount1/><ref name=viscount2/> ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.<ref name=\"newsatelier\">{{cite news |title=Afrikaserie: Simbabwe (Africa Series: Zimbabwe) |first=Walter |last=Doebler |location=Ottersweier |url=http://www.newsatelier.de/html/simbabwe.html |work=newsatelier.de |language=German |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|loc=chpt. ZIPRA in the Zimbabwe War of National Liberation}}</ref> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\">{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|pp=48\u201372}}</ref>\n\nZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as ''Storming the Heavens'' to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\"/>\n\nThe ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted briefly to British rule, and a general election took place in early 1980. This election was supervised both by the UK and international forces.\n\nRobert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.\n\n==Pre-war events==\n\n===Civil disobedience (1957\u20131964)===\n[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In 1962, Rhodesia was split about equally between black ''(orange and purple)'' and white ''(yellow)'' areas.

On 12 September 1957 members of the Youth League and the defunct ANC formed the [[Southern Rhodesia African National Congress]], led by Joshua Nkomo.

Nkomo became its leader in October. An NDP delegation headed by Nkomo attended the constitutional conference in January 1961. While Nkomo initially supported the constitution, he reversed his position after other NDP leaders disagreed. The government banned the NDP in December 1961 and arrested NDP leaders, excluding Nkomo who, again, was out of the country.

The embargo meant the Rhodesia was hampered by a lack of modern equipment but it used other means to receive vital war supplies such as [[Petroleum|oil]], munitions, and arms via the [[apartheid]] government of South Africa. War material was also obtained through elaborate international smuggling schemes, domestic production, and captured infiltrating enemy combatants.<ref name=smith109116/>\n\nFive months later, on 28 April 1966, the Rhodesian Security Forces engaged militants in [[Sinoia]], during the [[Sinoia battle|first major engagement of the war]].<ref name=\"events\"/> Seven ZANLA men were killed, and in retaliation the survivors killed two civilians at their farm near Hartley three weeks later.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 39\"/>\n\nDuring Portuguese rule of Mozambique, until 1974\u20131975, Rhodesia was able to defend its border with Zambia relatively easily and prevent many guerrilla incursions. It set up a strong defense along the [[Zambezi River]] running from [[Lake Kariba]] to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders.<ref name=\"Britannica 1971 259\"/> The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the [[attack on Altena Farm]] in north-east Rhodesia. In response, the Rhodesians moved to attack nationalists in their foreign camps and staging areas before they could infiltrate into Rhodesia.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|pp=39\u201340}}</ref>\n\nSecret cross-border operations by the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]] began in the mid-1960s, with Rhodesian Security Forces already engaging in hot pursuits into Mozambique. However, three weeks after the attack on Altena Farm, ZANLA killed two civilians and abducted a third into Mozambique and then Tanzania. In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40\" />\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President [[Kenneth Kaunda]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1972|p=235}}</ref>\n\nBritain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Rhodesia joined [[Alcora Exercise]], a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and [[South West Africa]] and against the hostile neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.\n\n===Second phase (1972\u20131979)===\n{{for|Rhodesian Army counter-insurgency tactics|Fireforce}}\n[[File:Rhodesian reservists on patrol.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian reservist soldiers on patrol with [[FN FAL]] rifles during the 1970s.]]\nThe black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring [[Zambia]] and from [[FRELIMO]]-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of [[Mozambique]], making periodic raids into [[Rhodesia]]. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1974|p=600}}</ref> As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977. No white male 17-year-olds were allowed to leave the country.\n\nIn April 1974, the left-wing [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal heralded the coming end of colonial rule in Mozambique. A transitional government was formed within months and Mozambique became independent under FRELIMO rule on 25 June 1975.

Even overt South African support for Rhodesia was waning. South Africa began scaling back economic assistance to Rhodesia, placed limits on the amount of fuel and munitions being supplied to the Rhodesian military, and withdrew the personnel and equipment they had previously provided to aid the war effort, including a border police unit that had been helping guard the Rhodesia-Zambia border.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1976|pp=619\u2013620}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the length of active military service was extended to 18 months; this took effect immediately, with soldiers about to end their one-year service finding their active service extended. Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty and subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor.

When all was ready a Rhodesian soldier took his vehicle loudspeaker and announced, in Shona, \"''Zimbabwe tatora''\", meaning \"we have taken Zimbabwe\", and Nyathi blew a whistle signalling the cadres to muster.

As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on \"New Chimoio\" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties.{{#tag:ref|The increased guerrilla capabilities were evident during that raid in that the insurgents, now armed with Soviet surface-to-air missiles, were able to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter, killing all 12 on board.<ref name=\"beckett2\">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2007}}</ref>|group=\"n\"}} However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in [[Harare|Salisbury]] also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.\n\n====Military pressure====\nThe larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIPRA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country.<ref name=beckett2/> Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.<ref name=lohman4/>\n\nBy putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: {{Main|Rhodesia Regiment}} The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s.<ref name=beckett2/> Part of the economic decline was due to white men being called up for extended periods of military service, which also affected many Rhodesian families.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nPolitically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the \"internal\" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] under a new constitution in 1979.\n\n===Resolution===\nUnder the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, [[Josiah Zion Gumede]] became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1 &#124; 1979: End of white rule in Rhodesia |work=BBC News |date=18 April 1980}}</ref> The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued. The hoped for recognition of the internal settlement, and of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, by the newly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not materialise after the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|latter's election]] in May 1979. Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the [[Carter administration]] also refused to recognise the internal settlement.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher blocked talks with 'Terrorist' Mugabe |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-12-30-margaret-thatcher-blocked-talks-with-terrorist-mugabe |first=Katherine |last=Haddon |location=London |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the [[Commonwealth]].

During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesian parliament voted itself out of power, and [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]] was appointed by the British government to rule the country as Governor-Designate, arriving in Salisbury on 12 December to take over from President Gumede.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3950000/3950445.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 11 &#124; 1979: Rhodesia reverts to British rule |work=BBC News |date=11 December 1941}}</ref> On 21 December 1979, a cease-fire was announced.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998 65\"/> An election was scheduled for early 1980.

From December 1972 to December 1979, 4,360 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.<ref name=fall/>\n\nAfter he assumed power, [[Robert Mugabe]] acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\".

ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the war in [[Rhodesia]] can be traced to the conquest of the region by the [[British South Africa Company]] in the late 19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=37}}</ref> Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full [[dominion]] status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923.\n\nIn his famous \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule.<ref name=wessels6873/> But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos [[Congo Crisis|as had resulted]] in the former [[Belgian Congo]] after its independence in 1960.<ref name=\"wessels6873\">{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|pp=68\u201373}}</ref>\n\nBritain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) on 11 November 1965.

Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibanda|2005\n|p=321}}</ref> ZANU and its military wing [[ZANLA]] were headed by [[Robert Mugabe]] and consisted primarily of [[Shona language|Shona]] tribes.

[[Ian Smith]] further expounded this by portraying the conflict as primarily anti-communist in nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Michael|date=June 2007|title=The Wretched of the Empire: Politics, Ideology and Counterinsurgency in Rhodesia, 1965\u201380|journal=Small Wars & Insurgencies|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175\u2013195|doi=10.1080/09574040701400601|issn=0959-2318}}</ref> The Rhodesian whites, and a percentage of well-off blacks, viewed the British demand for majority-rule as a direct attack on their way of life. Having previously witnesses the communist redistribution of resources after the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau Rebellion]], Rhodesians refused to allow the majority-rule policy to come into effect. Much of the Rhodesian economy as well as the land was controlled by white Rhodesians, and, fearing total confiscation by either the ZIPRA or ZANLA, the RF elected to hold onto the unofficial minority-rule. In ignoring other contributing factors to the conflict, Smith and the RF were able to strengthen ties with the West, however, Britain remained neutral. The division between the communists and anti-communists caused the fighting to spill over the Rhodesian borders. Neighboring African nations, supported primarily by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, utilized communist material support to begin launching guerrilla attacks on the RF.\n\nThe United States took the official position that it would not recognize Rhodesia as an independent sovereign. However, many American soldiers who had seen combat in Vietnam quickly joined into the Rhodesian Front. The RF created advertising campaigns in order to attract soldiers from Western countries, and the RF amassed a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers that were highly trained in special forces and guerrilla warfare, bringing the total RF military force to over 10,000 men. Many of the professional American soldiers entering the RF directly into the force became de facto members of the Rhodesian government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vvaveteran.org/32-2/32-2_rhodesia.html|title=The VVA Veteran, a publication of Vietnam Veterans of America|website=vvaveteran.org|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union became extremely invested in the Rhodesian Bush War.

The Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the Whites) on behalf of the whole population (including the Black majority) against several externally financed parties made up of predominantly Black [[Radicalization|radicals]] and communists. The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.<ref name=\"binda48\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, in the person of the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]], had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the [[British South Africa Company]] and granted [[self-governing colony|self-governing status]] to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of Whites. Ian Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] party was elected to power in 1962 and [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.<ref name=\"binda48\"/>\n\nThe Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the [[rule of law]] and democracy by fighting Communists, but it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs, not the ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, whom it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.<ref name=\"wood2008542\">{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|pp=542\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978\u20131979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an \"Internal Settlement\" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and arranged multiracial elections, which were held [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|in 1979]] and won by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who became the country's first Black head of government. Unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.\n\nThe war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. The UK Government held another election [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]] to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by [[Robert Mugabe]], was recognised internationally, and the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Belligerents==\n\n===Rhodesian Security Forces===\n{{main|Rhodesian Security Forces}}\n[[File:Rhodesian African Rifles, Lake Kariba, December 1976, 3.png|thumb|upright|Two soldiers of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] aboard a patrol boat on [[Lake Kariba]], December 1976.

While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the [[Rhodesian SAS]] and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978\u20131979 the rest was majority black.<ref name=\"lohman3\">{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military [[British South Africa Police]] of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as a type of home guard.<ref name=\"lohman3\"/>\n\nThe war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the [[Selous Scouts]] and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. The [[Rhodesian Army]] fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.<ref name=\"abbott17\">{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"binda186188\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBy 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent [[Vietnam War]] experience.<ref name=\"abbott17\"/><ref name=\"binda186188\"/>\n\nConsidering the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|arms embargo]], the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian [[FN FAL]] Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the [[H&K G3]] rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[bolt-action]] rifle were used by reservists and the [[British South Africa Police]]. Other weapons included the [[Bren]] LMG in both .303\" and 7.62mm NATO, [[Sten]] SMG, [[Uzi]], [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, Colt [[M16 rifle]] (very late in the war), [[FN MAG]] (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, [[L16 81mm Mortar|81 mm mortar]], and [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore]] mines. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]], Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as \"sanction-busting\".<ref name=smith109116/> South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.\n\nThe [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the [[World War II]] vintage [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transport aircraft and the British [[de Havilland Vampire]]. The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966. The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, the [[Cessna Skymaster]] as well as [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]] (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the [[Bell 205|Agusta Bell 205]].<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 41\"/> Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use a few Agusta Bell [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brent|1987|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as [[Eland Mk7|Eland armoured cars]] were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made [[T-55]] tanks destined for [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war.<ref name=\"bindaQuartz\">{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=462\u2013472}}</ref> The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled [[MRAP|mine-proofed armoured vehicles]], often using Mercedes [[Unimog]], [[Land Rover]] and [[Bedford trucks|Bedford]] truck components, including unlicensed copies of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[UR-416]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid-Daly|Stiff|1983|p=425}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying [[submachine gun]]s. A [[siege mentality]] set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.\n\nThe Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), [[Harare|Salisbury]] and District (\"SALOPS\").\n{{clear}}\n\n===Nationalist guerrilla forces===\nThe two major armed groups campaigning against [[Ian Smith]]'s government were the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians.

In contrast to ZANLA's [[Mozambique]] links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards [[Zambia]] for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]'' (the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] of South Africa) and South-West African [[SWAPO]] fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because [[ZAPU]]'s political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] Viscount aeroplanes, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|on 3 September 1978]] and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|12 February 1979]]. Using [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport.<ref name=viscount1/><ref name=viscount2/> ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.<ref name=\"newsatelier\">{{cite news |title=Afrikaserie: Simbabwe (Africa Series: Zimbabwe) |first=Walter |last=Doebler |location=Ottersweier |url=http://www.newsatelier.de/html/simbabwe.html |work=newsatelier.de |language=German |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|loc=chpt. ZIPRA in the Zimbabwe War of National Liberation}}</ref> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\">{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|pp=48\u201372}}</ref>\n\nZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as ''Storming the Heavens'' to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.<ref name=\"Dabengwa 1995 48\u201372\"/>\n\nThe ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted briefly to British rule, and a general election took place in early 1980. This election was supervised both by the UK and international forces.\n\nRobert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.\n\n==Pre-war events==\n\n===Civil disobedience (1957\u20131964)===\n[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In 1962, Rhodesia was split about equally between black ''(orange and purple)'' and white ''(yellow)'' areas.

The embargo meant the Rhodesia was hampered by a lack of modern equipment but it used other means to receive vital war supplies such as [[Petroleum|oil]], munitions, and arms via the [[apartheid]] government of South Africa. War material was also obtained through elaborate international smuggling schemes, domestic production, and captured infiltrating enemy combatants.<ref name=smith109116/>\n\nFive months later, on 28 April 1966, the Rhodesian Security Forces engaged militants in [[Sinoia]], during the [[Sinoia battle|first major engagement of the war]].<ref name=\"events\"/> Seven ZANLA men were killed, and in retaliation the survivors killed two civilians at their farm near Hartley three weeks later.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, p. 39\"/>\n\nDuring Portuguese rule of Mozambique, until 1974\u20131975, Rhodesia was able to defend its border with Zambia relatively easily and prevent many guerrilla incursions. It set up a strong defense along the [[Zambezi River]] running from [[Lake Kariba]] to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders.<ref name=\"Britannica 1971 259\"/> The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the [[attack on Altena Farm]] in north-east Rhodesia.

However, three weeks after the attack on Altena Farm, ZANLA killed two civilians and abducted a third into Mozambique and then Tanzania. In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40\" />\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President [[Kenneth Kaunda]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1972|p=235}}</ref>\n\nBritain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Rhodesia joined [[Alcora Exercise]], a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and [[South West Africa]] and against the hostile neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.\n\n===Second phase (1972\u20131979)===\n{{for|Rhodesian Army counter-insurgency tactics|Fireforce}}\n[[File:Rhodesian reservists on patrol.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian reservist soldiers on patrol with [[FN FAL]] rifles during the 1970s.]]\nThe black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring [[Zambia]] and from [[FRELIMO]]-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of [[Mozambique]], making periodic raids into [[Rhodesia]]. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1974|p=600}}</ref> As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977.

A transitional government was formed within months and Mozambique became independent under FRELIMO rule on 25 June 1975.

Even overt South African support for Rhodesia was waning. South Africa began scaling back economic assistance to Rhodesia, placed limits on the amount of fuel and munitions being supplied to the Rhodesian military, and withdrew the personnel and equipment they had previously provided to aid the war effort, including a border police unit that had been helping guard the Rhodesia-Zambia border.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|1976|pp=619\u2013620}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the length of active military service was extended to 18 months; this took effect immediately, with soldiers about to end their one-year service finding their active service extended. Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty and subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor. Rhodesia also recruited foreign volunteers for service, with groups of foreigners who served in Rhodesia including the [[The Crippled Eagles|Crippled Eagles]] and [[7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)|7 Independent Company]].<ref name=fall>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2012/10/19/the-fall-of-rhodesia/ |title=The Fall of Rhodesia |publisher=Popularsocialscience.com |date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/681613642.html?dids=681613642:681613642&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+26%2C+1976&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Rhodesia+to+Seek+More+Black+Soldiers&pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives \u2013 Rhodesia to Seek More Black Soldiers |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=26 November 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Black Conscription Protestors Arrested |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19781125&id=XgMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5461,2563770 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Montreal Gazette |agency=Reuters |date=25 November 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rhodesians add six months to Conscription |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=muZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6527,1218119 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=UPI |date=5 May 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Many Blacks ignore call-up in Rhodesia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19790112&id=fv9jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3506,2527817 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=AAP-Reuter |date=12 January 1979}}</ref>\n\nLate in 1976, Ian Smith accepted the basic elements of the compromise proposals made by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] to introduce majority rule within two years.<ref>{{cite news |title=White rule in Rhodesia to end |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=23 September 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm}}</ref> The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas.

While these operations reportedly inflicted thousands of casualties on Robert Mugabe's ZANLA cadres, probably blunting guerrilla incursions in the months that followed, nevertheless a steady intensification of the insurgency continued through 1978.\n\nTo disrupt FRELIMO's hold on Mozambique, the Rhodesian [[Central Intelligence Organisation]] helped to create and support an insurgency movement within Mozambique.

As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on \"New Chimoio\" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties.{{#tag:ref|The increased guerrilla capabilities were evident during that raid in that the insurgents, now armed with Soviet surface-to-air missiles, were able to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter, killing all 12 on board.<ref name=\"beckett2\">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2007}}</ref>|group=\"n\"}} However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in [[Harare|Salisbury]] also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.\n\n====Military pressure====\nThe larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIPRA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country.<ref name=beckett2/> Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.<ref name=lohman4/>\n\nBy putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: {{Main|Rhodesia Regiment}} The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s.<ref name=beckett2/> Part of the economic decline was due to white men being called up for extended periods of military service, which also affected many Rhodesian families.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nPolitically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the \"internal\" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] under a new constitution in 1979.\n\n===Resolution===\nUnder the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, [[Josiah Zion Gumede]] became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1 &#124; 1979: End of white rule in Rhodesia |work=BBC News |date=18 April 1980}}</ref> The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued. The hoped for recognition of the internal settlement, and of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, by the newly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not materialise after the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|latter's election]] in May 1979. Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the [[Carter administration]] also refused to recognise the internal settlement.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher blocked talks with 'Terrorist' Mugabe |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-12-30-margaret-thatcher-blocked-talks-with-terrorist-mugabe |first=Katherine |last=Haddon |location=London |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the [[Commonwealth]].

During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesian parliament voted itself out of power, and [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]] was appointed by the British government to rule the country as Governor-Designate, arriving in Salisbury on 12 December to take over from President Gumede.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3950000/3950445.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 11 &#124; 1979: Rhodesia reverts to British rule |work=BBC News |date=11 December 1941}}</ref> On 21 December 1979, a cease-fire was announced.<ref name=\"Rogers 1998 65\"/> An election was scheduled for early 1980.

The Rhodesian military may have seriously considered a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1980.<ref name=bindaQuartz/> This alleged coup was to consist of two stages: [[Operation Quartz]], coordinated attacks on guerrilla assembly points within the country, and Operation Hectic, the assassination of Mugabe and his key aides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/quartz.htm |title=Operation Quartz \u2013 Rhodesia 1980 |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, even in the context of alleged voter intimidation by ZANLA elements, widespread support for Mugabe from large sections of the black population (in particular from the [[Shona people|Shona]] language group which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's population) could not be seriously disputed. Moreover, the clear absence of any external support for such a coup, and the inevitable conflagration that would have engulfed the country thereafter, scuttled the plan.<ref name=bindaQuartz/>\n\nThe election of early 1980 was won by Mugabe, who became prime minister after [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front|ZANU-PF]] received 63% of the vote. By 16 March 1980, all Commonwealth forces had departed, save for 40 infantry instructors who temporarily stayed behind to train the new nation's army.<ref name=britains-smallwars/> On 18 April 1980, interim British rule ended and the country was internationally recognised as independent. The colony of Southern Rhodesia was formally renamed Zimbabwe, and on 18 April 1982, the government changed the name of the country's capital from Salisbury to [[Harare]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Zimbabwe|Robert Mugabe}}\nAccording to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 were killed during the war. From December 1972 to December 1979, 4,360 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.<ref name=fall/>\n\nAfter he assumed power, [[Robert Mugabe]] acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\".

Marlene King]] and portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]].

In both books and television, Hanna is shown as a former overweight shiny girl who becomes a [[Queen bee (sociology)|queen-bee]] after her best friend, [[Alison DiLaurentis]], mysteriously disappear. While in the books, Hanna develops a fierce personality\u2014result of years of psychological torture schematized by \"A\"\u2014, in the TV show, she grows up as kind as possible.\nHanna's middle name is Olivia, she is also after Alison's \"death\" it girl of Rosewood Highschool, she and her best friend Mona Vanderwaal are totally different and the most popular girls, they started to steal and Hanna got caught for stealing sunglasses in Pilot episode.\n\n== Character in print ==\nIn the first book, Hanna is introduced as a popular, ruthless girl.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pretty Little Liars|url=https://archive.org/details/prettylittleliar00shep|url-access=registration|author=Shepard, Sara|year=2006|publisher=HarperTeen|author-link=Sara Shepard}}</ref> She is described as an alluring redhead young, and occasionally is fighting with herself in order to keep her beauty look.

She is best friends with Alison DiLaurentis along with [[Spencer Hastings]], [[Aria Montgomery]] and [[Emily Fields]]. Like the other girls, Hanna and Alison had a secret between them: Alison witnessed Hanna purging with a toothbrush in order to thrill herself when she realizes she's overweight. During the night of the last of [[7th grade]], while having a sleepover in Spencer's sister Melissa's barn, Alison disappeared. Years later, in the [[9th grade]], Hanna tried out for cheerleading, but didn't make it, since the cheerleaders considered her too fat and not pretty enough to be in the squad. Hanna and Mona Vanderwaal, a girl that Hanna and her friends used to make fun of for being dorky, decided to become skinny and pretty before the next year's cheerleading tryouts. They bonded and became pretty and popular, eventually deciding that cheerleading wasn't even cool enough to try out for. Hanna took over Alison's spot as the most popular after her disappearance. Within that time, Hanna and Mona also became shoplifters.\n\n== Character on screen ==\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn December 2009, ''[[The Futon Critic]]'' confirmed the casting of [[Ashley Benson]] as Hanna Marin.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.abcfamilymedianet.com/docs/2009/12/ABCFam_120709.pdf|title=ABC Family announces additional casting for its upcoming pilots|publisher=[[ABC Family]]|date=December 7, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5n6CoSPTj?url=http://www.abcfamilymedianet.com/docs/2009/12/ABCFam_120709.pdf|archive-date=January 27, 2010|access-date=July 27, 2016|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Relationships ===\n\n==== Sean Ackard ====\nHanna's relationship with Sean started before the first episode because she thought he was the love of her life later to find out he was a female dog after she became a popular girl and he noticed her.
