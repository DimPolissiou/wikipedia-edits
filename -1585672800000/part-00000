He continued some projects of his father, in particular, the [[Karlskirche]], the ''[[Hofbibliothek]]'' (Imperial Library), and the ''Winterreitschultrakt'' ([[Winter Riding School]]) of the [[Hofburg]].  However, after his father, he also worked on many palaces, castles, and churches, as well as numerous [[monument]]s, gardens, [[tomb]]s, and [[altar]]s (see \"[[#Works|Works]]\" below).<ref name=ErlachDWP/>\n\nHe first developed his skills in his father's workshop. In 1711, he worked on several of his father's commissions (e.g. [[Palais Lobkowitz|Palais Dietrichstein]], [[Trautson]] Palace, [[B\u00f6hmi Hofkanzlei]], [[Schwarzenberg Palace]]) and also helped complete the publication ''\"Draft of a historical architecture\"''; whose four volumes inspired many later designs. Through this work, Joseph Emanuel came into contact both with the architecture of his and earlier times and with Berne, his father's noble order.\n\nHis father also involved Joseph Emanuel in the writing of ''\"Folders and Outlines of some buildings of Vienna, self-drawn from J.E.F.v.E.,\"'' with a preface by the court [[antiquarian]] [[Carl Gustav Heraeus]]. This publication was resumed later by [[Salomon Kleiner]].\n\nUntil 1714, he received instruction in Vienna from his father's guest [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. The two obtained a travel scholarship for Joseph Emanuel from [[Kaiser]] [[Karl VI]]. This led him in 1713/1714 to [[Italy]], where he accompanied, among others, the well-known [[archaeologist]] [[Francesco de Ficoroni]].\n\nFrom 1717 to 1719, he was in [[France]] with the French court master-builder [[Robert de Cotte]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], and with the philologist [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]. He also spent time in [[Leyden]] and [[London]], where he studied the re-invented ''[[Steam engine]]s'' and possibly also met [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nIn 1722 he returned to Vienna. He sought and obtained (in December 1722) a court architect position where he also exercised his considerable technical abilities, building the first steam engine in continental Europe (at Schwarzenberg Palace) during the same year. After the death of his father 1723, [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] succeeded to the position of chief Court Architect. In 1725, Joseph Emanuel, succeeded in turn to this position, probably with the help of his powerful sponsor, Court Building director, count [[Gundaker von Althan]], completing his father's unfinished projects. Though a successful architect in his own right, he was overshadowed by his more famous father.\n\nIn 1727, he had married Maria Anna von Dietrich, with whom he had 7 children. He lived in the ''[[Gerstenbrandische]] Haus'' (Gerstenbrandi house) with the ''[[K\u00e4rntner]]'' gate. He had an important art collection and extensive library.

He continued some projects of his father, in particular, the [[Karlskirche]], the ''[[Hofbibliothek]]'' (Imperial Library), and the ''Winterreitschultrakt'' ([[Winter Riding School]]) of the [[Hofburg]].  However, after his father, he also worked on many palaces, castles, and churches, as well as numerous [[monument]]s, gardens, [[tomb]]s, and [[altar]]s (see \"[[#Works|Works]]\" below).<ref name=ErlachDWP/>\n\nHe first developed his skills in his father's workshop. In 1711, he worked on several of his father's commissions (e.g. [[Palais Lobkowitz|Palais Dietrichstein]], [[Trautson]] Palace, [[B\u00f6hmi Hofkanzlei]], [[Schwarzenberg Palace]]) and also helped complete the publication ''\"Draft of a historical architecture\"''; whose four volumes inspired many later designs. Through this work, Joseph Emanuel came into contact both with the architecture of his and earlier times and with Berne, his father's noble order.\n\nHis father also involved Joseph Emanuel in the writing of ''\"Folders and Outlines of some buildings of Vienna, self-drawn from J.E.F.v.E.,\"'' with a preface by the court [[antiquarian]] [[Carl Gustav Heraeus]]. This publication was resumed later by [[Salomon Kleiner]].\n\nUntil 1714, he received instruction in Vienna from his father's guest [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. The two obtained a travel scholarship for Joseph Emanuel from [[Kaiser]] [[Karl VI]]. This led him in 1713/1714 to [[Italy]], where he accompanied, among others, the well-known [[archaeologist]] [[Francesco de Ficoroni]].\n\nFrom 1717 to 1719, he was in [[France]] with the French court master-builder [[Robert de Cotte]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], and with the philologist [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]. He also spent time in [[Leyden]] and [[London]], where he studied the re-invented ''[[Steam engine]]s'' and possibly also met [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nIn 1722 he returned to Vienna. He sought and obtained (in December 1722) a court architect position where he also exercised his considerable technical abilities, building the first steam engine in continental Europe (at Schwarzenberg Palace) during the same year. After the death of his father 1723, [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] succeeded to the position of chief Court Architect. In 1725, Joseph Emanuel, succeeded in turn to this position, probably with the help of his powerful sponsor, Court Building director, count [[Gundaker von Althan]], completing his father's unfinished projects. Though a successful architect in his own right, he was overshadowed by his more famous father.\n\nIn 1727, he had married Maria Anna von Dietrich, with whom he had 7 children. He lived in the ''[[Gerstenbrandische]] Haus'' (Gerstenbrandi house) with the ''[[K\u00e4rntner]]'' gate. He had an important art collection and extensive library. His wife died in 1740.\n\nIn 1729, Joseph Emanuel was appointed Imperial Court Chamber Advisor and dedicated himself increasingly to building steam engines for mine excavation. For this work he was made a [[Baron]] in 1735.\n\nHe continued some projects of his father, in particular the [[Karlskirche]], the ''[[Hofbibliothek]]'' (Imperial Library), and the ''Winterreitschultrakt'' of the [[Hofburg]].

Following his first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who is the company's [[vice president]] to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games develops the [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers their internally developed video games, such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the \"most successful videogame engine\" by [[Guinness World Records]].<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |title=Most successful videogame engine |website=[[Guinness World Records]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151655/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEpic Games owns video game developers [[Chair Entertainment]] and [[Psyonix]], as well as cloud-based software developer [[Cloudgine]], and operates eponymous sub-studios in [[Seattle]], [[England]], [[Berlin]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Seoul]]. While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, [[Tencent]] acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a [[games as a service]] model. Following the release of the popular ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish [[esport]] events around ''Fortnite'', and launch the [[Epic Games Store]]. As of 2018, the company has an estimated {{USD|15 billion}} valuation.\n\n== History ==\n=== Potomac Computer Systems (1991\u20131992) ===\nPotomac Computer Systems was founded by [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] in 1991.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=https://gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |title=From The Past To The Future: Tim Sweeney Talks |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=May 25, 2009 |website=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=June 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204115638/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Sweeney was studying [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Maryland]].

His father Gheorghe was descended from a Macedonian family from Bitola, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. His mother, Sanda, born C\u0103\u0163\u0103naru, was originally from the commune of Crucea de Jos, [[Vrancea County]]. From 1926 to 1933 he attended the secondary school in R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat. His art teacher recommended him to the church painter Constantinescu and he became the latter's apprentice after school. In 1933, after receiving his baccalaureate, he moved to [[Bucharest]]. He took lessons with the painter [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], a noted personality in the Romanian art world, for the entrance examination of the Academy of Creative Arts. From 1933 to 1936 he studied at the Academy of Creative Arts in Bucharest in the class of the painter  [[Nicolae D\u0103r\u0103scu]].\n\n[[Image:1936 Peisaj la Balcic.jpg|280px|right|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Balcic Landscape'' \u2013 Private collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\nIn 1936, he had his first solo exhibition in a Bucharest art gallery, and also took a study trip to [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]] and [[Balcic]]. In 1937 he attended artillery officer's school, had an exhibition in [[Craiova]] with the writer [[Ion Ionescu (writer)|Ion Ionescu]]; the latter presented his [[novel]] ''Oameni cu buche'' (\"Men with books\" / \"Literate men\"). That year, he also began to sketch designs for women's clothing and fashion accessories for a Bucharest fashion house. He worked for the construction company SONACO, became a member of Sindicatul Artistilor din Rom\u00e2nia (the Union of Romanian Artists, which included painters, sculptors and graphic artists) and because a student at the well-known private art seminar \"Zapan\". His professors there were well-known painters such as [[Lucian Grigorescu]], [[Platon Cazanovici]] and [[Mihail Gheorghita]].\n\nIn 1938, together with the [[fresco]] painter Alexandru Mazilescu  he worked painting [[mural]]s. In [[Bukovina]], he had the opportunity to observe the well-known [[mural|wall paintings]] of the [[Painted churches of northern Moldavia|painted monasteries]]. From 1940 to 1944 he served in the Romanian military during [[World War II]], with a corps that advanced as far as [[Crimea]]. During the [[Axis powers|Axis]] retreat, his horse stepped on a mine, which exploded, killing the horse, and leaving him with a serious head wound that, for over a decade, left him unable to distinguish colors, which mean that he could not paint and had to seek other work. In 1945 he participated in seminars in theatre directing and [[set design]] at ARLUS, led by Professor [[Ion Sava]]. He was the teacher of the painter [[:fr:Zwy_Milshtein|Zwy Milshtein]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1946\u20131947 he was employed at the film [[production company]] Filmul Popular, who had a laboratory in Bucharest on Strada Scaune. He worked with some [[Hungary|Hungarian]] specialists to modernize this film laboratory, eventually becoming head of the laboratory. As a result, he was assigned to modernize a film laboratory in [[Mogo\u015foaia]], owned by the National Tourism Office (Oficiul National de Turism, ONT). The Mogo\u015foaia laboratory had been wrecked in the bombardament toward the end of the War. This time, he had to do the job without professional Hungarian help.\n \nDuring his time at the ONT laboratory (1948\u20131951), he also founded his own advertising studio for the [[film industry]].\n\nIn 1951\u20131955, \u015etef\u0103nescu worked for the state ministry of electrical power, as director of the electro chain stores of the country. In 1956, though, he started his own design studio in Bucharest. Around 1957, his health stabilized, and under the encouragement of the painter [[Nicolae Darascu]], his former professor and later friend, he began again to paint. In summer 1957, he resumed painting [[landscape]]s near Bucharest ([[Cernica]], [[Frumu\u015fani|Pas\u0103rea]], [[B\u0103neasa]], [[Mogo\u015foaia]]).\n\n=== Municipal Theater Bucharest ===\n[[Image:1965 Arlechinii.jpg|250px|left|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Arlechinii'' (\"Harlequins\") \u2013 Private Collection, Germany]] In 1958 he took a position as production director at the [[Bulandra Theater|Lucia Sturdza Bulandra Municipal Theater]] (now Bulandra Theatre) in Bucharest and became a member of the Union of Creative Artists of Romania (Uniunea Artistilor Plastici din Rom\u00e2nia, UAP). The director of the theater, the actress [[Lucia Sturdza Bulandra]], Grande Dame of the Bucharest theatre at this time, knew him as a student of Ion Sava, a theatre professor teaching directing and set design, and in 1959 gave him the order for the stage design for the drama ''C\u00e2nd vei fi \u00eentrebat'' (\"When You'll Be Asked\") of the playwright Dorel Dorian. \u015etef\u0103nescu created the decor and costumes. That year, he also took a study trip to [[Timi\u0219oara]] and surrounding areas in western Romania, where he painted mostly landscapes and portraits of farmer.\n\nIn 1960 he was commissioned to execute a portrait of Tony Bulandra, husband of Lucia Sturdza Bulandra and probably Romania's best known actor at the time, for the museum of the [[National Theater Bucharest]]. He also did set design and costumes for the play ''Mamouret'' by [[Jean Sermet]] and toured with the Bulandra company to [[Budapest]] and elsewhere in [[Hungary]], after which he stayed on another month in Budapest to settle tour matters. He took the opportunity to paint [[oil painting|oil]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] paintings, to draw, and to befriend Hungarian painters. After his return to Bucharest, these works were exhibited in Bucharest\nin the hall of the Sala Izvor, the main hall of the Bulandra Theatre.\n\n=== \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio ===\nIn 1961, \u015etef\u0103nescu did set design and costumes for Mihail Beniuc's play ''\u00centoarcerea'' (\"The Return\"). The UAP granted him his own studio in the [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Memorial Museum, and he had another solo exhibition at the Sala Izvor. The following year, he did stage design and costumes for A. I. \u015etef\u0103nescu's (no relation) inquisitorial courtroom drama ''Camera fierbinte'' (\"The hot room\" or \"The hot chamber\") and had another solo exhibition in the theater, exhibiting stage settings, blueprints of costumes, oil paintings, watercolors and [[graphics|drawings]].[[Image:1978 Inceputul de cantec.jpg|350px|right|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''\u00cenceputul de c\u00e2ntec'' (\"The beginning of song\") \u2013 Private Collection, Germany]]\n\nMisu Weinberg, one of Romania's most influential art collectors visited \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio, beginning a fruitful relationship that lasted until Weinberg's death. Weinberg displayed \u015etef\u0103nescu's works in the company of works by such Romanian masters as [[Theodor Pallady]], [[Gheorghe Petrascu]], [[Iosif Iser|Iser]] and others, raising \u015etef\u0103nescu's visibility among collectors, many of whom Weinberg accompanied to \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio.\n\nIn 1963, \u015etef\u0103nescu continued his set design and costume work with ''R\u0103zboi \u015fi pace'' (''[[War and Peace]]'') by [[Alfred Neumann (writer)|Alfred Neumann]], Erwin Piseator, and Guntram Pr\u00fcfer, based on the [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] novel. This production was the first in Romania to combine traditional stage settings with the [[reversal film|photographic slide]] projection. The same year, he also designed sets for the ''Portretul'' (''The Portrait'') by [[Alexandru Voitin]], and took a study trip to the [[Black Sea]] coast near [[Tuzla]]. In 1964, he participated in the biennial stage design salon in Bucharest and executed stage setting blueprints for the play \"Fii cuminte Cristofor'' (\"Behave, Christopher\") by Aurel Baranga.\n\nIn 1965, he participated in the annual salon of the creative arts sponsored by the City of Bucharest and had a solo exhibition at the [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Museum. The exhibition catalogue had a foreword by [[Nestor Ignat]] and text by Misu Weinberg. That year, he also made a study visit to [[Sighi\u015foara]], followed by further travel the next year to the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Bulgaria]], where he painted many watercolors and to the [[Danube Delta]] and to the Romanian Black Sea coast.\n\n[[Image:1985 Peisaj marin.jpg|320px|left|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Peisaj marin'' (\"Marine landscape\") \u2013 Private Collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\n\nIn 1967, he returned to stage and costume design, for the play ''Poetul \u015fi revolu\u0163ia'' (\"The Poet and the Revolution\") about [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], script by Valeriu Moisescu and Dinu Negreanu. He also did stage design for ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' (''The Morning Star'') by [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], and staged it again as an open air [[sound and light show]] at the Mogo\u015foaia Palace. In May 1967, he participated in the spring salon of the City of Bucharest in [[Her\u0103str\u0103u Park]].

Around this time, \u015etef\u0103nescu's paintings first show the egg-shaped elements that soon became a significant characteristic of his painting. His paintings drew the attention of the \"pope\" among the Romanian [[art criticism|art critics]], Professor [[Petru Comarnescu]]. He also continued his stage design and costumes, for the play ''Sf\u00e2r\u015fitul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului'' (''The End of the World'') by [[Victor Eftimiu]].\n\nHe participated in the 1969 City of Bucharest salon of the creative arts, and designed stage costumes for the Bulandra Theatre's production of ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]].<ref>Ibsen : ''[http://www.ibsen.net/index.gan?id=67314 Das Theaterst\u00fcck \"Gespenster\", Teatrul Lucia Sturdza Bulandra]''.</ref> He participated in the December 1969 \u2013 February 1970 exhibition ''\"Art roumain contemporain\"'' in the gallery Baccache in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] and paid a study visit to [[Bra\u015fov]].\n\n=== The 1970s ===\nIn 1970, \u015etef\u0103nescu had a solo exhibition at Simeza Gallery in Bucharest.

His father Gheorghe was descended from a Macedonian family from Bitola, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. His mother, Sanda, born C\u0103\u0163\u0103naru, was originally from the commune of Crucea de Jos, [[Vrancea County]]. From 1926 to 1933 he attended the secondary school in R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat. His art teacher recommended him to the church painter Constantinescu and he became the latter's apprentice after school. In 1933, after receiving his baccalaureate, he moved to [[Bucharest]]. He took lessons with the painter [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], a noted personality in the Romanian art world, for the entrance examination of the Academy of Creative Arts. From 1933 to 1936 he studied at the Academy of Creative Arts in Bucharest in the class of the painter  [[Nicolae D\u0103r\u0103scu]].\n\n[[Image:1936 Peisaj la Balcic.jpg|280px|right|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Balcic Landscape'' \u2013 Private collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\nIn 1936, he had his first solo exhibition in a Bucharest art gallery, and also took a study trip to [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]] and [[Balcic]].

That year, he also began to sketch designs for women's clothing and fashion accessories for a Bucharest fashion house. He worked for the construction company SONACO, became a member of Sindicatul Artistilor din Rom\u00e2nia (the Union of Romanian Artists, which included painters, sculptors and graphic artists) and because a student at the well-known private art seminar \"Zapan\". His professors there were well-known painters such as [[Lucian Grigorescu]], [[Platon Cazanovici]] and [[Mihail Gheorghita]].\n\nIn 1938, together with the [[fresco]] painter Alexandru Mazilescu  he worked painting [[mural]]s.

From 1940 to 1944 he served in the Romanian military during [[World War II]], with a corps that advanced as far as [[Crimea]]. During the [[Axis powers|Axis]] retreat, his horse stepped on a mine, which exploded, killing the horse, and leaving him with a serious head wound that, for over a decade, left him unable to distinguish colors, which mean that he could not paint and had to seek other work. In 1945 he participated in seminars in theatre directing and [[set design]] at ARLUS, led by Professor [[Ion Sava]].

As a result, he was assigned to modernize a film laboratory in [[Mogo\u015foaia]], owned by the National Tourism Office (Oficiul National de Turism, ONT). The Mogo\u015foaia laboratory had been wrecked in the bombardament toward the end of the War. This time, he had to do the job without professional Hungarian help.\n \nDuring his time at the ONT laboratory (1948\u20131951), he also founded his own advertising studio for the [[film industry]].\n\nIn 1951\u20131955, \u015etef\u0103nescu worked for the state ministry of electrical power, as director of the electro chain stores of the country. In 1956, though, he started his own design studio in Bucharest. Around 1957, his health stabilized, and under the encouragement of the painter [[Nicolae Darascu]], his former professor and later friend, he began again to paint. In summer 1957, he resumed painting [[landscape]]s near Bucharest ([[Cernica]], [[Frumu\u015fani|Pas\u0103rea]], [[B\u0103neasa]], [[Mogo\u015foaia]]).\n\n=== Municipal Theater Bucharest ===\n[[Image:1965 Arlechinii.jpg|250px|left|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Arlechinii'' (\"Harlequins\") \u2013 Private Collection, Germany]] In 1958 he took a position as production director at the [[Bulandra Theater|Lucia Sturdza Bulandra Municipal Theater]] (now Bulandra Theatre) in Bucharest and became a member of the Union of Creative Artists of Romania (Uniunea Artistilor Plastici din Rom\u00e2nia, UAP). The director of the theater, the actress [[Lucia Sturdza Bulandra]], Grande Dame of the Bucharest theatre at this time, knew him as a student of Ion Sava, a theatre professor teaching directing and set design, and in 1959 gave him the order for the stage design for the drama ''C\u00e2nd vei fi \u00eentrebat'' (\"When You'll Be Asked\") of the playwright Dorel Dorian. \u015etef\u0103nescu created the decor and costumes. That year, he also took a study trip to [[Timi\u015foara]] and surrounding areas in western Romania, where he painted mostly landscapes and portraits of farmer.\n\nIn 1960 he was commissioned to execute a portrait of Tony Bulandra, husband of Lucia Sturdza Bulandra and probably Romania's best known actor at the time, for the museum of the [[National Theater Bucharest]]. He also did set design and costumes for the play ''Mamouret'' by [[Jean Sermet]] and toured with the Bulandra company to [[Budapest]] and elsewhere in [[Hungary]], after which he stayed on another month in Budapest to settle tour matters. He took the opportunity to paint [[oil painting|oil]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] paintings, to draw, and to befriend Hungarian painters. After his return to Bucharest, these works were exhibited in Bucharest\nin the hall of the Sala Izvor, the main hall of the Bulandra Theatre.\n\n=== \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio ===\nIn 1961, \u015etef\u0103nescu did set design and costumes for Mihail Beniuc's play ''\u00centoarcerea'' (\"The Return\"). The UAP granted him his own studio in the [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Memorial Museum, and he had another solo exhibition at the Sala Izvor. The following year, he did stage design and costumes for A. I. \u015etef\u0103nescu's (no relation) inquisitorial courtroom drama ''Camera fierbinte'' (\"The hot room\" or \"The hot chamber\") and had another solo exhibition in the theater, exhibiting stage settings, blueprints of costumes, oil paintings, watercolors and [[graphics|drawings]].[[Image:1978 Inceputul de cantec.jpg|350px|right|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''\u00cenceputul de c\u00e2ntec'' (\"The beginning of song\") \u2013 Private Collection, Germany]]\n\nMisu Weinberg, one of Romania's most influential art collectors visited \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio, beginning a fruitful relationship that lasted until Weinberg's death. Weinberg displayed \u015etef\u0103nescu's works in the company of works by such Romanian masters as [[Theodor Pallady]], [[Gheorghe Petrascu]], [[Iosif Iser|Iser]] and others, raising \u015etef\u0103nescu's visibility among collectors, many of whom Weinberg accompanied to \u015etef\u0103nescu's studio.\n\nIn 1963, \u015etef\u0103nescu continued his set design and costume work with ''R\u0103zboi \u015fi pace'' (''[[War and Peace]]'') by [[Alfred Neumann (writer)|Alfred Neumann]], Erwin Piseator, and Guntram Pr\u00fcfer, based on the [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] novel. This production was the first in Romania to combine traditional stage settings with the [[reversal film|photographic slide]] projection. The same year, he also designed sets for the ''Portretul'' (''The Portrait'') by [[Alexandru Voitin]], and took a study trip to the [[Black Sea]] coast near [[Tuzla]]. In 1964, he participated in the biennial stage design salon in Bucharest and executed stage setting blueprints for the play \"Fii cuminte Cristofor'' (\"Behave, Christopher\") by Aurel Baranga.\n\nIn 1965, he participated in the annual salon of the creative arts sponsored by the City of Bucharest and had a solo exhibition at the [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Museum. The exhibition catalogue had a foreword by [[Nestor Ignat]] and text by Misu Weinberg. That year, he also made a study visit to [[Sighi\u015foara]], followed by further travel the next year to the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Bulgaria]], where he painted many watercolors and to the [[Danube Delta]] and to the Romanian Black Sea coast.\n\n[[Image:1985 Peisaj marin.jpg|320px|left|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Peisaj marin'' (\"Marine landscape\") \u2013 Private Collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\n\nIn 1967, he returned to stage and costume design, for the play ''Poetul \u015fi revolu\u0163ia'' (\"The Poet and the Revolution\") about [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], script by Valeriu Moisescu and Dinu Negreanu. He also did stage design for ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' (''The Morning Star'') by [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], and staged it again as an open air [[sound and light show]] at the Mogo\u015foaia Palace. In May 1967, he participated in the spring salon of the City of Bucharest in [[Her\u0103str\u0103u Park]]. Later that year he paid working visits to the Danube Delta and to Sibiu.\n\nIn May 1968, \u015etef\u0103nescu had a solo exhibition of oil and watercolour paintings in the exhibition room of the Gheorghe Tattarescu Museum, with the texts of the exhibition catalogue written by [[Florin Colona\u015f]]. Around this time, \u015etef\u0103nescu's paintings first show the egg-shaped elements that soon became a significant characteristic of his painting. His paintings drew the attention of the \"pope\" among the Romanian [[art criticism|art critics]], Professor [[Petru Comarnescu]]. He also continued his stage design and costumes, for the play ''Sf\u00e2r\u015fitul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului'' (''The End of the World'') by [[Victor Eftimiu]].\n\nHe participated in the 1969 City of Bucharest salon of the creative arts, and designed stage costumes for the Bulandra Theatre's production of ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]].<ref>Ibsen : ''[http://www.ibsen.net/index.gan?id=67314 Das Theaterst\u00fcck \"Gespenster\", Teatrul Lucia Sturdza Bulandra]''.</ref> He participated in the December 1969 \u2013 February 1970 exhibition ''\"Art roumain contemporain\"'' in the gallery Baccache in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] and paid a study visit to [[Bra\u015fov]].\n\n=== The 1970s ===\nIn 1970, \u015etef\u0103nescu had a solo exhibition at Simeza Gallery in Bucharest. He continued his theatre work, designing costumes for the Georges Feydeau [[farce]] ''Puricele \u00een ureche'' (''Une puce \u00e0 l'oreille'', ''A Flea in her Ear''); stage design was by [[Liviu Ciulei]]. He did stage design for the play ''Contrapuncte'' (''Counterpoints'') by Paul Everac and costume design for the film ''P\u0103durea sp\u00e2nzura\u0163ilor'' (''[[Forest of the Hanged]]'') directed by Liviu Ciulei. He also paid a study visit to [[Sibiu]] and [[Sighisoara]]. His work was included in a touring exhibition, \"Romanian Art\", in [[L\u00fcdenscheid]], Germany, [[Orly]], France, [[Vienna]], and the Watts Art Gallery in [[New York City]].\n\n[[Image:1982 Despartirea din urma.jpg|350px|right|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Desp\u0103r\u0163irea din urm\u0103'' (\"The Final Parting\" / \"Twilight of Hope\") \u2013 Private Collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\nIn 1971, he again participated in the salon of the creative arts, at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] in Bucharest, and in 1972 as the creative arts salon in the Dalles Gallery, Bucharest. In the latter year, he did stage design and costumes for the play ''Patru oameni f\u0103r\u0103 nume'' (''Four Nameless Men'') by [[Radu B\u0103dil\u0103]], and costumes for the play ''Povestiri din p\u0103durea vienez\u0103'' (''[[Tales from the Vienna Woods]]'') by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n von Horvath]] directed by Nicolae Alexandru Toscani.<ref>\u00d6d\u00f6n von Horvath : ''[http://www.cimec.ro/SCRIPTS/TeatreNou/detaliu_premiera.asp?sq=410201117005&sq1=6&sq2=Teatrul%20'Lucia%20Sturdza%20Bulandra'%20-%20Bucuresti&sq3=410201 Das Theaterst\u00fcck \"Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald\"]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1973, he had another solo exhibition at the Simeza Gallery; Traian Stoica wrote the foreword for the exhibition catalogue. That year, he was awarded the Ordinul \"[[Meritul Cultural]]\", the order of cultural merit. In 1974, he did stage design for the play ''\u00centre noi nu a fost dec\u00e2t t\u0103cerea'' \u2013 (''Between Us There Has Been Only Silence'') by Lia Cri\u015fan; this was the last of his theater activities; after this time, he devoted himself entirely to painting; his studio in this period became a meeting place for artists, critics and collectors. He participated again that year in the salon for the creative arts at the Gallery Dalles, and the next year in the exhibition ''12 Rum\u00e4nische Maler'' (\"12 Romanian Painters\") in [[Hamburg]], and made two study journeys, one to [[Czechoslovakia]] and the other to [[Medias]] and [[Bazna]].\n\nIn 1976, his solo exhibition in Bucharest's Gallery C\u0103minul Artei had a catalogue featuring critical texts by university professor of arts Dan Grigorescu and artist and critic Virgil Mocanu. He paid a study visit to [[Breaza]], a health resort preferred by painters. The next few years he focused on painting, with an eye toward a large exhibition; he paid study visits to [[Bazna]], [[Buzia\u015f]] and [[Covasna]].\n[[Image:1978 Singuratate.jpg|250px|left|thumb|George \u015etef\u0103nescu : ''Singur\u0103tate'' (\"Loneliness\")\u2013 Private Collection, Bucharest, Romania]]\nIn 1979, he participated again in the City of Bucharest salon for the creative arts at Gallery Dalles, after which he had a solo exhibition at the Art Gallery of the City of Bucharest (''Galeriile de Art\u0103 ale Municipiului Bucure\u015fti'').

Among those who contributed to the exhibition catalogue were museum expert [[Gheorghe Cosma]] and poet and journalist [[Radu Carneci]].\n\nAround this time, \u015etef\u0103nescu's work began to be seen a bit more in the West, and he began to garner more press attention. In 1984, he had solo exhibitions in [[Willebroek]], [[Belgium]] and [[Werdohl]], [[West Germany]].<ref>Ausstellungen in Belgien und Deutschland: ''[http://www.georgestefanescu.ro/catalog.php?id=18 Ausstellungskatalog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042303/http://www.georgestefanescu.ro/catalog.php?id=18 |date=2007-09-28 }}''.</ref> In 1985, this was followed by a solo exhibition at the Hagenring Gallery in [[Hagen]], West Germany . Two years later, in 1987, the Meridiane publishing house published a monograph about \u015etef\u0103nescu in the series ''Romanian Painters.'' Texts were written by the art historian [[Adriana Bobu]] (living in [[Paris]]). A report by the art expert Constan\u0163a Iliescu concerning his painting ''The dancers'' was published in the trade press in the series of articles \"Comori de Art\u0103 ale Capitalei\" (\"Art treasures of the Capital\"). In a Chinese-language magazine on Romania, several pages were dedicated to his painting.
