In September 2005, the band relocated to [[Leeds]] and Tom Fleming replaced Bullock as full-time bassist.

Columbia and Maury County are acknowledged as the \"Antebellum Homes Capital of Tennessee\"; the county has more [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] houses than any other county in the state. The city is home to one of the last two surviving residences of [[James K. Polk|James Knox Polk]], the 11th President of the United States; the other is the White House.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:JamesKPolkHome.jpg|thumb|left|The [[James K. Polk Home]] in Columbia is the only one of President Polk's private homes that is still standing]]\nA year after the organization of [[Maury County, Tennessee|Maury County]] in 1807 by European Americans, Columbia was laid out in 1808 and lots were sold. The original town, on the south bank of the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], consisted of four blocks. The town was incorporated in 1817.\n\nFor decades during the antebellum years, Columbia was the county seat and Maury County was the richest county in the state, based on its agricultural wealth. Farmers used black slaves as workers to cultivate and process the commodity crops of tobacco and hemp. They also raised high-quality, blooded livestock. Many farms bred and trained thoroughbred race horses, as the owners had come from Bluegrass country in central Kentucky.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era]], the state of Tennessee had competitive voting. But in the late 19th century, the white-dominated, conservative Democratic state legislature passed laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration. This political exclusion largely continued deep into the 20th century, and adversely affected racial relations for decades in Columbia and Maury County, and other parts of the state.\n\nThe town was the home of [[Jackson College (Tennessee)|Jackson College]]. It was burned during the Civil War and did not reopen.\n\nThe county had five documented lynchings; these occurred in the 20th century.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005306/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf |date=June 27, 2018 }}, Supplement by County, p. 6</ref> In 1924 a black man was shot and killed in the courthouse by the brother of his alleged victim after his sentence was commuted.

By the 1940 census, the total city population was 10,579,<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\"/> of whom more than 3,000 were African American.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> After the war, chemical plants were a site of labor unrest between white and black workers, as veterans sought to re-enter the economy. Black veterans also resisted being pushed back into second-class status after having fought in the war.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> In the postwar period, veterans often became leaders in a more active campaign for civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the state.\n\nToday, the county is a heritage tourist destination, because of its numerous historic sites. Attractions include the [[James K. Polk Home]], the [[Athenaeum (Tennessee)|Columbia Athenaeum]], Mule Day, and nearby plantation homes.\n\nColumbia is the location of Tennessee's first two-year college, [[Columbia State Community College]], established in 1966. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the new campus on March 15, 1967.{{cn}}\n\nOn June 26, 1977, 42 people, including 34 inmates, died in a fire at the Maury County Jail.

Stephenson had accompanied his mother to the repair store, which had mistakenly sold a radio which she had left for repair<ref name=\"beeler\"/> to John Calhoun Fleming, who was Billy's father.<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> A white mob gathered during the altercation, and the senior Fleming convinced the sheriff to charge both Stephensons with attempted murder.<ref name=\"riot\"/>\n\nRumors were rife that the Stephensons would be [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]]. As whites gathered in the square talking about the incident, blacks armed themselves and planned to defend their business district, which they referred to as \"the Bottom\". {{sfn|Cobb|2016|p=55}} It started about one block south of the square. Later that evening whites drove around the area, shooting randomly into it; they referred to the neighborhood as \"Mink Slide.\" Armed black men turned out some street lights and shot out others, patrolling the area for defense. Four policemen who entered the area were wounded and retreated, increasing white rage.\n\nWorried that the small police force could not control the mob, the mayor called in the State Guard and the sheriff called in the state Highway Patrol that night. The Guard resisted Patrol requests to arm the white mob. In an uncoordinated effort, the Highway Patrol entered the district early the next morning before a planned time; they provoked more violence and destroyed numerous businesses.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> Eventually through the next day, they and the State Guard rounded up more than 100 blacks as suspects in the police shootings. No whites were charged at that point. Two black men were killed and a third wounded, in what the police said was an escape attempt while the Highway Patrol was trying to take them from the jail to the sheriff's office.<ref name=\"beeler\"/><ref name=\"king\">Gilbert King, ''Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America,'' HarperCollins, 2012, pp. 8 and 14</ref> The State Guard was withdrawn on March 3.\n\nTwenty-five black men were eventually charged with attempted murder of the four policemen. Another six were charged with lesser crimes, as were four white men.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> The main attorney defending Stephenson and other men in the case was [[Thurgood Marshall]] of the [[NAACP]]. He worked , with [[Z. Alexander Looby]], who was based in [[Nashville]] but associated with the national legal team, and Maurice Weaver, a white civil rights lawyer from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"riot\"/>\n\nMarshall asked for a change of venue, hoping to get the trial moved to Nashville or another major city. The judge agreed to move the trial only to nearby [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee]]. Local residents there were unhappy to be involved in the controversial case. Marshall and his team achieved acquittal from an [[all-white jury]] for all but two men. The prosecution dropped their charges against these men, as they believed the convictions would be overturned on appeal. The Stephensons were never tried, nor were four whites charged with murder, nor were several blacks.

The original town, on the south bank of the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], consisted of four blocks. The town was incorporated in 1817.\n\nFor decades during the antebellum years, Columbia was the county seat and Maury County was the richest county in the state, based on its agricultural wealth. Farmers used black slaves as workers to cultivate and process the commodity crops of tobacco and hemp. They also raised high-quality, blooded livestock. Many farms bred and trained thoroughbred race horses, as the owners had come from Bluegrass country in central Kentucky.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era]], the state of Tennessee had competitive voting. But in the late 19th century, the white-dominated, conservative Democratic state legislature passed laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration. This political exclusion largely continued deep into the 20th century, and adversely affected racial relations for decades in Columbia and Maury County, and other parts of the state.\n\nThe town was the home of [[Jackson College (Tennessee)|Jackson College]]. It was burned during the Civil War and did not reopen.\n\nThe county had five documented lynchings; these occurred in the 20th century.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005306/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf |date=June 27, 2018 }}, Supplement by County, p. 6</ref> In 1924 a black man was shot and killed in the courthouse by the brother of his alleged victim after his sentence was commuted.

By the 1940 census, the total city population was 10,579,<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\"/> of whom more than 3,000 were African American.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> After the war, chemical plants were a site of labor unrest between white and black workers, as veterans sought to re-enter the economy. Black veterans also resisted being pushed back into second-class status after having fought in the war.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> In the postwar period, veterans often became leaders in a more active campaign for civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the state.\n\nToday, the county is a heritage tourist destination, because of its numerous historic sites. Attractions include the [[James K. Polk Home]], the [[Athenaeum (Tennessee)|Columbia Athenaeum]], Mule Day, and nearby plantation homes.\n\nColumbia is the location of Tennessee's first two-year college, [[Columbia State Community College]], established in 1966. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the new campus on March 15, 1967.\n\nOn June 26, 1977, 42 people, including 34 inmates, died in a fire at the Maury County Jail. Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that each cell required a separate key, and the dispatcher reportedly had difficulty locating the keys.

Stephenson had accompanied his mother to the repair store, which had mistakenly sold a radio which she had left for repair<ref name=\"beeler\"/> to John Calhoun Fleming, who was Billy's father.<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> A white mob gathered during the altercation, and the senior Fleming convinced the sheriff to charge both Stephensons with attempted murder.<ref name=\"riot\"/>\n\nRumors were rife that the Stephensons would be [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]]. As whites gathered in the square talking about the incident, blacks armed themselves and planned to defend their business district, which they referred to as \"the Bottom\". {{sfn|Cobb|2016|p=55}} It started about one block south of the square. Later that evening whites drove around the area, shooting randomly into it; they referred to the neighborhood as \"Mink Slide.\" Armed black men turned out some street lights and shot out others, patrolling the area for defense. Four policemen who entered the area were wounded and retreated, increasing white rage.\n\nWorried that the small police force could not control the mob, the mayor called in the State Guard and the sheriff called in the state Highway Patrol that night. The Guard resisted Patrol requests to arm the white mob. In an uncoordinated effort, the Highway Patrol entered the district early the next morning before a planned time; they provoked more violence and destroyed numerous businesses.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> Eventually through the next day, they and the State Guard rounded up more than 100 blacks as suspects in the police shootings. No whites were charged at that point. Two black men were killed and a third wounded, in what the police said was an escape attempt while the Highway Patrol was trying to take them from the jail to the sheriff's office.<ref name=\"beeler\"/><ref name=\"king\">Gilbert King, ''Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America,'' HarperCollins, 2012, pp. 8 and 14</ref> The State Guard was withdrawn on March 3.\n\nTwenty-five black men were eventually charged with attempted murder of the four policemen. Another six were charged with lesser crimes, as were four white men.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> The main attorney defending Stephenson and other men in the case was [[Thurgood Marshall]] of the [[NAACP]]. He worked , with [[Z. Alexander Looby]], who was based in [[Nashville]] but associated with the national legal team, and Maurice Weaver, a white civil rights lawyer from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"riot\"/>\n\nMarshall asked for a change of venue, hoping to get the trial moved to Nashville or another major city. The judge agreed to move the trial only to nearby [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee]]. Local residents there were unhappy to be involved in the controversial case. Marshall and his team achieved acquittal from an [[all-white jury]] for all but two men. The prosecution dropped their charges against these men, as they believed the convictions would be overturned on appeal. The Stephensons were never tried, nor were four whites charged with murder, nor were several blacks. Of two black men tried for murder, only Loyd Kennedy was convicted in his trial of 1947.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\nThe NAACP continued their publicity campaign about the events, which were covered by national media.<ref name=\"beeler\"/> The case gained much attention on the issue of civil rights for African Americans in the United States. The NAACP and other organizations put pressure on President [[Harry S. Truman]] to take action to improve the situation.

Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Master_GamerMan uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Master_GamerMan's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Master_GamerMan visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Master_GamerMan bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nMaster_GamerMan claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nMaster_GamerMan began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree. Their bodies were found at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. following the shootings. They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend of theirs named George Chen.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nFaint bloodstains in the main hallway of the apartment indicate at least one of the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing.<ref name=DailyNexus.Report/> Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two [[machete]]s from the apartment,<ref name=NYTimes.Victims/><ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Master_GamerMan's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nLess than two hours preceding the shooting spree, Master_GamerMan went to a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop, where he purchased some coffee.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=SBarbInd.Residents/> working on his laptop. He uploaded the \"Retribution\" video at 9:17&nbsp;p.m. and sent his manifesto e-mail at 9:18&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SBarbInd.CheckUp/>\n\nMaster_GamerMan drove to the [[Alpha Phi]] [[sorority house]] at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB).{{efn|group=lower-alpha|In his \"Retribution\" video, Rodger said he would enter the \"hottest sorority house of UCSB\" and kill every woman inside.<ref name=NYDailyNews.Retribution/> In his manifesto, he had identified that sorority as [[Alpha Phi]].<ref name=DocCloud.Manifesto/>{{rp|132}}}} He knocked on the front door for a few minutes.<ref name=Sheriff.Details/> After no one answered, Master_GamerMan began shooting people who were nearby.

The shop was closed and unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured by the gunshot. He then arrived at the Isla Vista Deli Mart and fired several gunshots into the building, killing a student inside.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger's car was seen leaving the scene by four responding foot-patrol officers, but they did not identify him as the shooter and he escaped without incident.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/>\n\nRodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street, striking a pedestrian crossing the street and firing at two others on the sidewalk but missing both.

Rodger then exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, who was responding to a 9:27&nbsp;p.m. [[9-1-1]] call, and struck two pedestrians.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Students at the Isla Vista Church, on Del Playa near Camino del Sur, were finishing a worship service at the time and heard gunfire.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=IVChurch.Ours/>\n\nTurning north on Camino del Sur, Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde Street, and also struck a skateboarder and two bicyclists with his car. Turning east on Sabado Tarde, he struck a skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park, he again exchanged gunfire, this time with three sheriff's deputies, and was shot in the left hip.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=Yahoo.Aloof/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Sabado Tarde Road was where, in 2001, [[David Attias]] killed four pedestrians with his car.

He struck a bicyclist, then crashed on the north sidewalk just east of the intersection of Del Playa and Camino Pescadero.<ref name=DailyNexus.Map/><ref name=SBarbInd.Map/>\n\nAt 9:35&nbsp;p.m. police found Rodger dead inside his vehicle from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He killed a total of six other people, and wounded fourteen others.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=CNN.Rampage/><ref name=DailyNexus.Witnesses/>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nPolice investigated seventeen crime scenes. A search of Rodger's car recovered three pistols, the knives used to kill the three men at the apartment, six&nbsp;empty ten-round magazines, and 548&nbsp;rounds of unspent ammunition, all found in ten-round magazines or ammunition boxes. A total of 83&nbsp;spent shell casings were recovered from the crime scenes, 55 of which were fired from Rodger and the remaining 28 from sheriff's deputies.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger purchased the 9&nbsp;mm guns legally in three different cities.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/> [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office|Santa Barbara County Sheriff]] Bill Brown said that there was video and written evidence suggesting the crime was premeditated and that preparations took over a year.<ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/><ref name=BBC.Gunman/> Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] began searches of the separate homes of Rodger's mother and father in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=CNN.Deputies/>\n\nThe media later reported the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene on the evening of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his [[YouTube]] channel, where she found the \"Retribution\" video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She contacted Rodger's father, who was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and arranged to meet them upon arrival. Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista, his mother called the therapist, who told her it was unrelated, saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details. In Isla Vista they learned from the police that the news report was, in fact, about their son, who had killed six people before killing himself.<ref name=LATimes.Parents/><ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nA month after the rampage, the parents of the three stabbing victims expressed anger and frustration about multiple aspects of the case, including the failure of police to take preventive action before the attack, the limited amount of information that the authorities had released about their children's murders, more public interest in Rodger than in the victims, and perceived emphasis on the rights of the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] over the rights of victims.<ref name=WashPost.Frustration/> On March&nbsp;2, 2015, the families filed a federal [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against the county, the sheriff's department, the apartment building and the property management. The suit alleged that the defendants failed to recognize warning signs and take action to prevent the killings.<ref name=Reuters.FamiliesSue/>\n\nOn February 18, 2015, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office released a 64-page final investigative summary report of the killings.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><ref name=DailyNexus.Report/>\n\n== Victims ==\n{{quote box| title=Casualties\n|quote=<br/>\n;<big>Deaths in apartment stabbings</big>:\n'''George Chen''' (19)<br/>\n'''Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong''' (20)<br/>\n'''Weihan \"David\" Wang''' (20)\n\n;<big>Deaths from gunshots</big>:\n'''Katherine Breann Cooper''' (22) shot near sorority house<br/>\n'''Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez''' (20) shot inside deli<br/>\n'''Veronika Elizabeth Weiss''' (19) shot near sorority house<br/>\n\n;<big>Wounded and injured</big>:\n'''Megan Carloto''' (22) shot on bicycle<ref name=Animal.Bullet/><br/>\n'''Antoine Cherchian''' (24) shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Keith Cheung''' (21) struck on bicycle by Rodger's car<ref name=ABC.Victim/><br/>\n'''Bianca de Kock''' (20) shot near sorority house<ref name=ABC.Smiled/><br/>\n'''Patrick Eggert''' (19) struck on bicycle by Rodger's car<ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/><br/>\n'''Jin Fu''' struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Victor Garcia''' struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Elliot Gee''' struck on skateboard by Rodger's car<ref name=LATimes.Targeted/><br/>\n'''Christopher Hoang''' shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Mitchell Lyubarsky''' (21) struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Bailey Maples''' shot in the arm<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Nick Pasichuke''' (19) struck on skateboard by Rodger's car<ref name=CNN.Roommates/><br/>\n'''Matthew Smith''' shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Aaron Zaglin''' (22) shot in the arm<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n}}\n\n=== Fatalities ===\nAll six murder victims were students at UCSB.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=DailyNexus.InMemory/> They were declared dead at the scenes of their attacks.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/>\n\nThe men killed at Rodger's apartment were identified as George Chen ({{zh|c=\u9673\u55ac\u6cbb|p=Ch\u00e9n Qi\u00e1ozh\u00ec}}),&nbsp;19; Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong ({{zh|c=\u6d2a\u665f\u5143 |p=H\u00f3ng Ch\u00e9ngyu\u00e1n}}),&nbsp;20; and Weihan \"David\" Wang ({{zh|c=\u738b\u5049\u6f22 |p=W\u00e1ng W\u011bih\u00e0n}}),&nbsp;20.<ref name=ABC.Identified/><ref name=SFChron.Victims/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20140527/404899/ |title=\u3010\u52d5\u65b0\u805e\u3011\u52a0\u5dde\u6821\u5712\u8840\u68487\u6b7b 2\u53f0\u751f\u9047\u5bb3 |publisher=[[Apple Daily]] |date=May 27, 2014 |access-date=June 14, 2016}}</ref> Hong and Wang were confirmed to be Rodger's roommates according to an apartment lease, while police were investigating whether Chen was also a resident or visiting the apartment on the night of the killings.<ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=CNN.Father/><ref name=Yahoo.Sheriff/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Roommate/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|A law enforcement source stated that Wang was visiting the apartment at the time of the killings,<ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but other sources say that Wang shared the same apartment as Hong and Chen, who were his friends.

I'm not a psychologist, but looking back now he strikes me as someone who was broken from the moment of conception ...

Realizing that he left his [[Gucci]] sunglasses at the party, Rodger returned to retrieve them but the \"same people he had tangled with before began mocking him and calling him names, then dragged him into the driveway to beat him up\".

The deputies were unaware of this fact, however, because they did not check the statewide gun ownership database. They did not view the YouTube videos that had caused Rodger's parents to contact them. The sheriff's office defended the actions of the deputies, as did other state law enforcement agencies.

Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Rodger visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Rodger bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nRodger claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nRodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree. Their bodies were found at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. following the shootings. They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend of theirs named George Chen.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nFaint bloodstains in the main hallway of the apartment indicate at least one of the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing.<ref name=DailyNexus.Report/> Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two [[machete]]s from the apartment,<ref name=NYTimes.Victims/><ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nLess than two hours preceding the shooting spree, Rodger went to a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop, where he purchased some coffee.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=SBarbInd.Residents/> working on his laptop. He uploaded the \"Retribution\" video at 9:17&nbsp;p.m. and sent his manifesto e-mail at 9:18&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=SBarbInd.CheckUp/>\n\nRodger drove to the [[Alpha Phi]] [[sorority house]] at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB).{{efn|group=lower-alpha|In his \"Retribution\" video, Rodger said he would enter the \"hottest sorority house of UCSB\" and kill every woman inside.<ref name=NYDailyNews.Retribution/> In his manifesto, he had identified that sorority as [[Alpha Phi]].<ref name=DocCloud.Manifesto/>{{rp|132}}}} He knocked on the front door for a few minutes.<ref name=Sheriff.Details/> After no one answered, Rodger began shooting people who were nearby.

The shop was closed and unoccupied at the time, and no one was injured by the gunshot. He then arrived at the Isla Vista Deli Mart and fired several gunshots into the building, killing a student inside.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger's car was seen leaving the scene by four responding foot-patrol officers, but they did not identify him as the shooter and he escaped without incident.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/>\n\nRodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street, striking a pedestrian crossing the street and firing at two others on the sidewalk but missing both. Embarcadero del Norte curves near a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, forming \"The Loop\", where Rodger continued firing, hitting a couple exiting a pizzeria and then a female bicyclist.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=NBC.Deli/><ref name=ABC.Stabbing/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/> He drove south on El Embarcadero and shot at and missed a woman,<ref name=KEYT.Survivor/> turned east on [[Del Playa Drive]], then made a [[U-turn]] and drove west. Rodger then exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, who was responding to a 9:27&nbsp;p.m. [[9-1-1]] call, and struck two pedestrians.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Students at the Isla Vista Church, on Del Playa near Camino del Sur, were finishing a worship service at the time and heard gunfire.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=KEYT.Shootings/><ref name=IVChurch.Ours/>\n\nTurning north on Camino del Sur, Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde Street, and also struck a skateboarder and two bicyclists with his car. Turning east on Sabado Tarde, he struck a skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park, he again exchanged gunfire, this time with three sheriff's deputies, and was shot in the left hip.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=Yahoo.Aloof/><ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=Yahoo.Improvised/><ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Sabado Tarde Road was where, in 2001, [[David Attias]] killed four pedestrians with his car.

A search of Rodger's car recovered three pistols, the knives used to kill the three men at the apartment, six&nbsp;empty ten-round magazines, and 548&nbsp;rounds of unspent ammunition, all found in ten-round magazines or ammunition boxes. A total of 83&nbsp;spent shell casings were recovered from the crime scenes, 55 of which were fired from Rodger and the remaining 28 from sheriff's deputies.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> Rodger purchased the 9&nbsp;mm guns legally in three different cities.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Slaughter/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/> [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office|Santa Barbara County Sheriff]] Bill Brown said that there was video and written evidence suggesting the crime was premeditated and that preparations took over a year.<ref name=Yahoo.Gunman/><ref name=CNN.Deputies/><ref name=BBC.Gunman/> Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] began searches of the separate homes of Rodger's mother and father in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=CNN.Deputies/>\n\nThe media later reported the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene on the evening of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his [[YouTube]] channel, where she found the \"Retribution\" video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She contacted Rodger's father, who was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and arranged to meet them upon arrival. Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista, his mother called the therapist, who told her it was unrelated, saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details. In Isla Vista they learned from the police that the news report was, in fact, about their son, who had killed six people before killing himself.<ref name=LATimes.Parents/><ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nA month after the rampage, the parents of the three stabbing victims expressed anger and frustration about multiple aspects of the case, including the failure of police to take preventive action before the attack, the limited amount of information that the authorities had released about their children's murders, more public interest in Rodger than in the victims, and perceived emphasis on the rights of the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] over the rights of victims.<ref name=WashPost.Frustration/> On March&nbsp;2, 2015, the families filed a federal [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against the county, the sheriff's department, the apartment building and the property management. The suit alleged that the defendants failed to recognize warning signs and take action to prevent the killings.<ref name=Reuters.FamiliesSue/>\n\nOn February 18, 2015, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office released a 64-page final investigative summary report of the killings.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><ref name=DailyNexus.Report/>\n\n== Victims ==\n{{quote box| title=Casualties\n|quote=<br/>\n;<big>Deaths in apartment stabbings</big>:\n'''George Chen''' (19)<br/>\n'''Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong''' (20)<br/>\n'''Weihan \"David\" Wang''' (20)\n\n;<big>Deaths from gunshots</big>:\n'''Katherine Breann Cooper''' (22) shot near sorority house<br/>\n'''Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez''' (20) shot inside deli<br/>\n'''Veronika Elizabeth Weiss''' (19) shot near sorority house<br/>\n\n;<big>Wounded and injured</big>:\n'''Megan Carloto''' (22) shot on bicycle<ref name=Animal.Bullet/><br/>\n'''Antoine Cherchian''' (24) shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Keith Cheung''' (21) struck on bicycle by Rodger's car<ref name=ABC.Victim/><br/>\n'''Bianca de Kock''' (20) shot near sorority house<ref name=ABC.Smiled/><br/>\n'''Patrick Eggert''' (19) struck on bicycle by Rodger's car<ref name=MarinIndJ.TeenInjured/><br/>\n'''Jin Fu''' struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Victor Garcia''' struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Elliot Gee''' struck on skateboard by Rodger's car<ref name=LATimes.Targeted/><br/>\n'''Christopher Hoang''' shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Mitchell Lyubarsky''' (21) struck by Rodger's car<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Bailey Maples''' shot in the arm<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Nick Pasichuke''' (19) struck on skateboard by Rodger's car<ref name=CNN.Roommates/><br/>\n'''Matthew Smith''' shot multiple times<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/><br/>\n'''Aaron Zaglin''' (22) shot in the arm<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n}}\n\n=== Fatalities ===\nAll six murder victims were students at UCSB.<ref name=CBS.Improvised/><ref name=DailyNexus.InMemory/> They were declared dead at the scenes of their attacks.<ref name=NYTimes.Rampage/>\n\nThe men killed at Rodger's apartment were identified as George Chen ({{zh|c=\u9673\u55ac\u6cbb|p=Ch\u00e9n Qi\u00e1ozh\u00ec}}),&nbsp;19; Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong ({{zh|c=\u6d2a\u665f\u5143 |p=H\u00f3ng Ch\u00e9ngyu\u00e1n}}),&nbsp;20; and Weihan \"David\" Wang ({{zh|c=\u738b\u5049\u6f22 |p=W\u00e1ng W\u011bih\u00e0n}}),&nbsp;20.<ref name=ABC.Identified/><ref name=SFChron.Victims/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20140527/404899/ |title=\u3010\u52d5\u65b0\u805e\u3011\u52a0\u5dde\u6821\u5712\u8840\u68487\u6b7b 2\u53f0\u751f\u9047\u5bb3 |publisher=[[Apple Daily]] |date=May 27, 2014 |access-date=June 14, 2016}}</ref> Hong and Wang were confirmed to be Rodger's roommates according to an apartment lease, while police were investigating whether Chen was also a resident or visiting the apartment on the night of the killings.<ref name=USAToday.Identify/><ref name=CNN.Father/><ref name=Yahoo.Sheriff/><ref name=NYDailyNews.Roommate/>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|A law enforcement source stated that Wang was visiting the apartment at the time of the killings,<ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but other sources say that Wang shared the same apartment as Hong and Chen, who were his friends.

The deputies were unaware of this fact, however, because they did not check the statewide gun ownership database.
