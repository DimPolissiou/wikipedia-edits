The film premiered on April 30, 1996 on CBS.\n\nThough the film received little to no critical acclaim, [[John Ritter]] was praised for his performance as an abusive husband and graduating from his best known role as the lovable [[Jack Tripper]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nPaul Hegstrom is a [[domestic violence|ferociously violent man]], and is a top salesman at a car dealership. Paul's wife of 17 years, Judy, is a homemaker. They have three children, Tammy, Jeff, and Heidi. Judy called Paul at work, after he told her to check in with him, but he was with a client, and her call cost him a sale. Judy sits on the floor in their bedroom, with a bruised and bloody face, amongst glass shards, apologizing to Paul. Paul's light colored button down shirt has visible blood stains at the wrists, as he washes his hands, and fixes a [[compress (medical)|compress]] for Judy, and professes his love for her.\n\nThe next morning, as the kids get ready for school, it is made clear that the Hegstrom's oldest daughter, a high school aged\u2014 Tammy, is fully aware of the abuse that happens and she does not buy in to any cover-up excuses. Paul is also having an affair with Beth French, the owner of a local bar he frequents with his coworkers. Beth tries to break it off with Paul because he won't leave his wife and kids. Paul goes home that evening and starts in on Judy when Tammy comes into the kitchen and confronts him. Tammy begins to call the police, and Paul throws her into a wall and she hits her head. Paul storms out of the house, noticing his other children hiding. He goes to Beth's house and lies to her about leaving Judy. At work, Paul is in a sales slump and snaps when his boss, Tom, tries to discuss it, and the personal problems he's been having lately.\n\nPaul's rage continues to escalate when Beth asks about the status of his divorce. At work, Paul has a shouting match in Tom's office over a deal he handled incorrectly, and Paul is fired. Judy is served with divorce papers. Paul gets a job at another car dealership, and quits shortly after, having gotten into argument with his boss. After getting drunk at a bar, Paul goes to Judy's house and is arrested after they refuse to let him in. Beth is tipped off by several people about what occurred that evening, and tries to throw him out of her house, and he beats her. As she tries to get away, she is thrown through a glass shower door, causing her to need several hundred stitches and treatment for broken bones. \n\nThe DA office is pushing to file attempted murder charges against Paul, but Beth agrees not to file charges against him if he joins and completes a group counseling program for domestic violence offenders. Beth's other condition is that he gets out of her life. At the group session, Paul has trouble relating to the other men in the group, thinking he is not like them, and that his issues are not as serious as theirs. One night, the other men in the group confront Paul about his behavior and he storms out, and he is warned that if he leaves, he cannot come back. Paul destroys his apartment and nearly attempts suicide.\n\nRealizing the group is his only chance to salvage what little life he has left, he begs the group to let him back in, and they do. A year later, Paul approaches Judy about seeing the kids after not having seen them the whole time. Jeff and Heidi agree to see him, but Tammy refuses. Paul graduates from the program, and Judy, Jeff, and Heidi attend the ceremony, where he gives a speech about breaking the cycle. They continue to spend time together as a family, with the exception of Tammy. It is revealed that Paul and Judy eventually remarried and opened treatment centers for men who batter women in the United States, and, as of the date of the film, Tammy had never fully reconciled with her father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Ritter]] as Paul Hegstrom\n* [[Harley Jane Kozak]] as Judy Hegstrom\n* [[Gina Philips]] as Tammy Hegstrom\n* [[Aaron Leigh]] as Jeff Hegstrom\n* [[Elisabeth Lund]] as Heidi Hegstrom\n* [[Susan Gibney]] as Beth French\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Milton \"Milt\" Stella\n* [[James McDaniel]] as Spider\n* [[Mariangela Pino]] as Helen Jessup\n\n==Legacy==\nThe real life Paul and Judy Hegstrom had been remarried for 34 years, at the time of his passing on April 27, 2017, after being divorced for 7 years.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.itssupernatural.org/sid-roth/our-guest-paul-hegstrom |title= Sid Roth 0749 It's Supernatural with Paul Hegstrom |date=2009 |accessdate= May 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newcomerdenver.com/Obituary/138670/Dr-Paul-Hegstrom/Denver-Colorado |title= Dr. Paul Higstrom Obituary |date=2017 | |accessdate= May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0118041|title=Unforgivable}}\n\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about domestic violence]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n\n\n{{US-tv-film-stub}}\n{{crime-drama-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Unforgivable\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = DVD cover\n| director       = [[Graeme Campbell (director)|Graeme Campbell]]\n| producer       = Jack Grossbart<br>Joan Barnett\n| writer         = Dan Levine<br>A.R.

More recently, the headquarters were moved to the neighboring city of Roseville, California.\nIn its 40-year history more than 60,000 volunteers have built churches, schools, orphanages, hospitals and community buildings in 67 countries.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\nMaranatha has requests for 100,000 buildings pending.<ref name=\"ann\" />\n\n==Volunteers==\nAn average of 3,000 volunteers participate in projects each year.<ref name=\"Maranatha_History\" />\nThe majority of the volunteers are from the United States and Canada but participants come from all over the world.\nThey generally pay for their [[transportation]] as well as a participation fee which covers [[meal]]s, [[lodging]], in-country transportation and [[insurance]] while on the project.\nMost projects are approximately two weeks duration.\n\nThe funding for the buildings is primarily furnished by Maranatha via donors as well as participation by [[Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries]] (ASI).\nThe local church provides the land and final labor and materials.\n\nProjects are classified into categories such as teen, young adult, open, group or family depending on the volunteer makeup.\nWhile the teen ''Ultimate Workout'' and young adult groups which are age limited, other projects have widely varying age volunteers.\nA number of volunteers participate in multiple trips, often on an annual basis.\n\nNot all volunteers are skilled in the construction trades.\nIn addition to actual building construction, some volunteers are typically involved in cooking and some may participate in community projects such as [[Vacation Bible School]] or medical and dental [[clinic]]s.\n\n==Active projects==\nMaranatha concentrates their building activities in certain countries which change from time to time.\nIn 2010 Maranatha is building primarily in Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Zambia and the United States.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\nIn 2009, 507 churches were built of which 428 of the structures were \"One-Day Churches\" built in 25 countries.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\n\n===Haiti===\nIn 2010 Maranatha provided assistance to [[Haiti]] following

Maranatha Flights International based in [[Berrien Springs, Michigan]].<ref name=\"Maranatha_History\" />\n\nIn 1989 Maranatha Flights International merged with Volunteers International under the new name of Maranatha Volunteers International and moved the headquarters to Sacramento, California. More recently, the headquarters were moved to the neighboring city of Roseville, California.\nIn its 40-year history more than 60,000 volunteers have built churches, schools, orphanages, hospitals and community buildings in 67 countries.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\nMaranatha has requests for 100,000 buildings pending.<ref name=\"ann\" />\n\n==Volunteers==\nAn average of 3,000 volunteers participate in projects each year.<ref name=\"Maranatha_History\" />\nThe majority of the volunteers are from the United States and Canada but participants come from all over the world.\nThey generally pay for their [[transportation]] as well as a participation fee which covers [[meal]]s, [[lodging]], in-country transportation and [[insurance]] while on the project.\nMost projects are approximately two weeks duration.\nThe funding for the buildings is primarily furnished by Maranatha via donors as well as participation by [[Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries]] (ASI).\nThe local church provides the land and final labor and materials.\n\nProjects are classified into categories such as teen, young adult, open, group or family depending on the volunteer makeup.\nWhile the teen ''Ultimate Workout'' and young adult groups which are age limited, other projects have widely varying age volunteers.\nA number of volunteers participate in multiple trips, often on an annual basis.\n\nNot all volunteers are skilled in the construction trades.\nIn addition to actual building construction, some volunteers are typically involved in cooking and some may participate in community projects such as [[Vacation Bible School]] or medical and dental [[clinic]]s.\n\n==Active projects==\nMaranatha concentrates their building activities in certain countries which change from time to time.\nIn 2010 Maranatha is building primarily in Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Zambia and the United States.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\nIn 2009, 507 churches were built of which 428 of the structures were \"One-Day Churches\" built in 25 countries.<ref name=\"Maranatha_FyF\" />\n\n===Haiti===\nIn 2010 Maranatha provided assistance to [[Haiti]] following

Other members of the Kochi Music Foundation also included Aashiq Abu\u2019s wife and actress Rima Kallingal, writer [[Syam Pushkaran]] and singer [[Sithara (Singer)]]. They were widely critisied in social media.\n\nFollowing the controversy, Ernakulam MP [[Hibi Eden]], through a Facebook post, demanded that Aashiq Abu should make it public whether he has made payment to the government. Following this, Aahsiq Abu posted the image of the cheque for an amount of Rs 6.22 lakh to the Principal Secretary (Finance), CMDRF.The date of the cheque is 14.02.2020.

They were widely critisied in social media.\n\nFollowing the controversy, Ernakulam MP [[Hibi Eden]], through a Facebook post, demanded that Aashiq Abu should make it public whether he has made payment to the government. Following this, Aahsiq Abu posted the image of the cheque for an amount of Rs 6.22 lakh to the Principal Secretary (Finance), CMDRF.The date of the cheque is 14.02.2020.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009'\"National [[Haredi]]\"') are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party.

The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each.

Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

Of the nine battles mentioned by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' during that year, only one was a West Saxon victory; but in this year Alfred succeeded his brother Ethelred, who died after the [[Battle of Merton]].<ref name=garmonsway70>Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 70-73</ref>\n\n[[Mercia]] had collapsed by 874, and the Army's cohesion went with it.

Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize.

Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize. Fortunately for Wessex, they did not use the time available effectively.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Location of the battle==\n[[Image:asser facsimile.png|thumb|right|150px|A 1722 copy of part of Asser's Life of King Alfred.]]\nThe primary sources for the location of the battle are [[Asser]]'s ''Life of King Alfred'', which names the place as \"''Ethandun''\" and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which has ''E\u00f0andune''.

Following the rise of [[fast food]] and [[take-out]] restaurants, a [[retronym]] for the older \"standard\" restaurant was created, '''sit-down restaurant'''.  Most commonly, \"sit-down restaurant\" refers to a casual-[[dining]] restaurant with [[table service]], rather than a [[fast food restaurant]] or a [[diner]], where one orders food at a [[countertop|counter]]. Sit-down restaurants are often further categorized, in North America, as \"family-style\" or \"[[Full course dinner|formal]]\".\n\nIn [[British English]], the term ''restaurant'' almost always means an eating establishment with table service, so the \"sit down\" qualification is not usually necessary. Fast food and takeaway (take-out) outlets with counter service are not normally referred to as restaurants. Outside North America, the terms fast casual dining restaurants, family style, and casual dining are not used and distinctions among different kinds of restaurants are often not the same. In France, for example, some restaurants are called \"bistros\" to indicate a level of casualness or trendiness, though some \"bistros\" are quite formal in the kind of food they serve and clientele they attract. Others are called \"brasseries\", a term which indicates hours of service. \"Brasseries\" may serve food round the clock, whereas \"restaurants\" usually only serve at set intervals during the day. In Sweden, restaurants of many kinds are called \"restauranger\", but restaurants attached to bars or cafes are sometimes called \"k\u00f6k\", literally \"kitchens\", and sometimes a bar-restaurant combination is called a \"krog\", in English a \"tavern\".\n\nIn ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'',{{full|date=December 2018}} [[Robert Appelbaum]] argues that all restaurants can be categorized according to a set of social parameters defined as polar opposites: high or low, cheap or dear, familiar or exotic, formal or informal, and so forth. Any restaurant will be relatively high or low in style and price, familiar or exotic in the cuisine it offers to different kinds of customers, and so on.  Context is as important as the style and form: a taqueria is a more than familiar sight in Guadalajara, Mexico, but it would be exotic in Albania.\n\n==Categories of restaurants==\n\n===Ethnic===\n{{maincat|Ethnic restaurants}}\nEthnic restaurants specialize in ethnic or national cuisines.

Fast casual restaurants usually do not offer full table service, but many offer non-disposable plates and cutlery. The quality of food and prices tend to be higher than those of a conventional fast food restaurant but may be lower than casual dining.\n\n===Casual dining===\nA [[List of casual dining restaurant chains|casual dining restaurant]] (or sit down restaurant) is a restaurant that serves moderately priced{{define|date=December 2018}} food in a casual{{define|date=December 2018}} atmosphere. Except for buffet-style restaurants, casual dining restaurants typically provide table service. Chain examples include [[Harvester (restaurant)|Harvester]] in the United Kingdom and [[TGI Fridays]] in the United States. Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast-food establishments and fine-dining restaurants. Casual-dining restaurants often have a full bar with separate bar staff, a full beer menu and a limited wine menu. They are frequently, but not necessarily, part of a wider chain, particularly in the US. In Italy, such casual restaurants are often called \"[[trattoria]]\", and are usually independently owned and operated.\n\n===Premium casual===\nPremium casual restaurants originate from Western Canada and include chains such as [[Cactus Club Cafe]], [[Earl's]] and [[JOEY]]. Premium casual restaurants are described as upscale fast casual. Similarly to casual dining, they typically feature a dining room section and a lounge section with multiple screens. They are typically found downtown or in shopping districts. Premium casual restaurants carry a wide range of menu options including burgers, steaks, seafood, pizza, pasta and Asian foods.<!-- This is horribly US-centric. Nowhere in the rest of the world would have this combination, let alone use this term. -->\n\n===Family style===\nFamily style restaurants are a type of casual dining restaurants where food is often served on platters and the diners serve themselves. It can also be used to describe family-friendly diners or casual restaurants. \n\n===Fine dining===\n[[File:The Fat Duck, High Street, Bray - geograph.org.uk - 1271175-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Fat Duck]], a fine dining destination restaurant in Bray, UK]]\n\nFine dining restaurants are full-service restaurants with specific dedicated meal courses. D\u00e9cor of such restaurants features higher-quality materials, with establishments having certain rules of dining which visitors are generally expected to follow, sometimes including a [[dress code]].  \n\nFine dining establishments are sometimes called ''white-tablecloth restaurants'', because they traditionally featured [[Table service|table service]] by servers, at tables covered by white tablecloths.  The tablecloths came to symbolize the experience.  The use of white tablecloths eventually became less fashionable, but the service and upscale ambiance remained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/dining-and-drinking/sd-et-dining-guide-white-tablecloth-20160930-story.html|title=Where fine dining is really fine|last=Parente|first=Michele|website=San Diego Union Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-12|quote=Nothing symbolizes fine dining like a white tablecloth.

In the United States, [[bistros]] usually have more refined decor, fewer tables, finer foods and higher prices. When used in [[English language|English]], the term ''bistro'' usually indicates a [[Continental food|continental]] menu.\n\n===Buffet and sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord===\n{{see also|List of buffet restaurants}}\n[[Buffet]]s and [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] offer patrons a selection of food at a fixed price. Food is served on trays around bars, from which customers with plates serve themselves. The selection can be modest or very extensive, with the more elaborate menus divided into categories such as salad, soup, appetizers, hot entr\u00e9es, cold entr\u00e9es, and dessert and fruit. Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.  In Italy, a kind of semi-buffet is featured in either a tavola calda, serving hot foods, and a tavola fredda, which serves cold food.  Either can be found in bars and cafes at meal times or in dedicated sites, sometimes with seating and service at a counter.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\n[[File:Byways Cafe (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|Byways Cafe in Portland, Oregon, USA]]\n\n[[British cafe]]s and American [[diner]]s are informal eateries offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches or rolls.  [[Coffeehouse]]s or caf\u00e9s are not full restaurants, because they primarily serve and derive the majority of their revenue from hot drinks.  Many cafes are open at breakfast time and will serve full hot breakfasts all day. In some areas, cafes offer outdoor seating. The word comes from the French ''caf\u00e9''.\n\n===Cafeteria===\nA [[cafeteria]] is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter.  There is no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter.  Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions. Cafeterias are common in hospitals, corporations and educational institutions. In Italy it's very common and known as \"mensa aziendale\".\n\nIn the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food and the use of the term [[cafeteria]] is deprecated in favour of '''self-service restaurant'''.  Cafeterias have a wider variety of prepared foods. For example, it may have a variety of roasts (e.g. beef, ham, turkey) ready for carving by a server, as well as other main courses, rather than simple offerings of hamburgers or fried chicken.\n\n===Coffee house===\n[[File:The Last Stand Coffee Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Last Stand Coffeehouse, seating optional]]\n{{see also|Tea house}}\n[[Coffeehouse]]s are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize [[coffee]] and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well by how the food is served}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n'''Restaurants''' fall into several industry classifications, based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well as the means by which the food is served to the customer.\n\n==Origin of categories==\nHistorically, ''restaurant'' referred only to places that provided tables where one ate while seated, typically served by a [[waiter]].

Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.  In Italy, a kind of semi-buffet is featured in either a tavola calda, serving hot foods, and a tavola fredda, which serves cold food.  Either can be found in bars and cafes at meal times or in dedicated sites, sometimes with seating and service at a counter.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\n[[File:Byways Cafe (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|Byways Cafe in Portland, Oregon, USA]]\n\n[[British cafe]]s and American [[diner]]s are informal eateries offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches or rolls.  [[Coffeehouse]]s or caf\u00e9s are not full restaurants, because they primarily serve and derive the majority of their revenue from hot drinks.  Many cafes are open at breakfast time and will serve full hot breakfasts all day. In some areas, cafes offer outdoor seating. The word comes from the French ''caf\u00e9''.\n\n===Cafeteria===\nA [[cafeteria]] is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter.  There is no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter.  Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions. Cafeterias are common in hospitals, corporations and educational institutions. In Italy it's very common and known as \"mensa aziendale\".\n\nIn the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food and the use of the term [[cafeteria]] is deprecated in favour of '''self-service restaurant'''.  Cafeterias have a wider variety of prepared foods. For example, it may have a variety of roasts (e.g. beef, ham, turkey) ready for carving by a server, as well as other main courses, rather than simple offerings of hamburgers or fried chicken.\n\n===Coffee house===\n[[File:The Last Stand Coffee Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Last Stand Coffeehouse, seating optional]]\n{{see also|Tea house}}\n[[Coffeehouse]]s are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize [[coffee]] and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Cinnamonheart", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFast food)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_restaurants"}

The third-century historical text ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguozhi'') is a major source of Chinese traditions concerning Shi Xie's life.{{sfnp|Werner|Dutton|Whitmore|2012|p=11}} He promoted [[Buddhism]] throughout his life. After his death, the Vietnamese attached many legends to him{{sfnp|Keown|2003|p=326}} and honoured him as '''King S\u0129''' (Vietnamese: '''S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng''') in some temples.\n\n==Family background and early life==\nShi Xie was born in Guangxin Commandery (\u5ee3\u4fe1\u90e1), [[Jiao Province]], which is in present-day [[Cangwu County]], [[Guangxi]], but his [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] was around present-day [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]. His ancestors moved to Jiao Province when [[Wang Mang]] usurped the throne and established the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323) with himself as its emperor. Shi Xie's father, Shi Ci (\u58eb\u8cdc), served as the Administrator of Rinan Commandery (\u65e5\u5357\u90e1) during the reign of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] ({{reign|146|168}}) of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The Shi family was one of the elite families of [[Han Chinese]] origin who later emigrated to present-day [[Vietnam]] and played a major role in developing Vietnamese civilisation.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\nIn his youth, Shi Xie studied the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' under the tutelage of one Liu Tao (\u5289\u9676) from [[Yingchuan Commandery]] (\u6f41\u5ddd\u90e1). Later, he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' (civil service candidate) and served in the Han central government as a Gentleman of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce) but was later dismissed because of \"official reasons\". After his father's death, he was nominated as a ''maocai'' (\u8302\u624d) and was appointed as the Prefect of Wu County (\u5deb\u7e23; present-day [[Wushan County, Chongqing]]). In 187, the Han central government reassigned him to be the Administrator (\u592a\u5b88) of Jiaozhi Commandery (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) in [[Jiao Province]].{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n==As a warlord in Jiao Province==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Shi Xie]]\n\nAround the time, Zhu Fu (\u6731\u7b26) had been appointed by the Han government to serve as the Inspector of [[Jiao Province]]. However, the locals in Jiao Province rebelled and killed him after he attempted to extract heavier taxes from them. The Han government then sent Zhang Jin (\u5f35\u6d25) to replace him, but Zhang Jin was later murdered by his subordinate Ou Jing (\u5340\u666f). When [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of [[Jing Province]], heard about this, he appointed Lai Gong (\u8cf4\u606d) as the new Inspector of Jiao Province without authorisation from the Han central government. At the same time, he also sent his subordinate Wu Ju (\u5433\u5de8) to replace the deceased Shi Huang (\u53f2\u749c) as the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (\u84bc\u68a7\u90e1). To counter Liu Biao's attempts to extend his influence into Jiao Province, the Han central government issued an imperial decree appointing Shi Xie as General of the Household Who Pacifies the South (\u7d8f\u5357\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07) and putting him in charge of the seven commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nAfter Shi Xie sent his subordinate Zhang Min (\u5f35\u65fb) to thank the Han central government and pay tribute, the Han central government further promoted him to General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (\u5b89\u9060\u5c07\u8ecd), in addition to enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Longdu Village (\u9f8d\u5ea6\u4ead\u4faf). Around the time, the Han Empire was in a state of chaos, as various warlords fought for power and territories in northern and central China. Jiao Province, being a remote province in southern China, was not caught up in the chaos. Shi Xie was effectively a warlord in control of Jiao Province even though he was still a nominal subject of the Han Empire. Shi Xie's younger brothers also held important positions in Jiao Province: Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9), Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b) and Shi Wu (\u58eb\u6b66) were respectively the Administrators of Hepu (\u5408\u6d66), Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77) commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nIn 210, Wu Ju got into conflict with Lai Gong and forced him out of Jiao Province. [[Sun Quan]], the warlord who controlled the territories in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region bordering Jiao Province, appointed his subordinate [[Bu Zhi]] as the Inspector of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship, but Wu Ju refused and secretly plotted to assassinate Bu Zhi.

Around the time, the Wu emperor [[Sun Quan]] wanted to split [[Jiao Province]] and create another province, Guang Province (\u5ee3\u5dde): Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Rinan (\u65e5\u5357) commanderies would remain part of Jiao Province; Cangwu (\u84bc\u68a7), Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77), Yulin (\u9b31\u6797) and Hepu (\u5408\u6d66) commanderies would form the new Guang Province. Sun Quan then appointed Dai Liang (\u6234\u826f) and [[L\u00fc Dai]] as the Inspectors of Jiao and Guang provinces respectively. Chen Shi (\u9673\u6642), a close aide of Sun Quan, was to replace Shi Hui as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery.\n\nIn 227, when Shi Hui learnt about the new arrangements, he refused to comply and rebelled against Wu rule by sending his troops to block Dai Liang and Chen Shi from entering Jiao Province. At the time, Huan Lin (\u6853\u9130), one of Shi Hui's subordinates, begged his superior to obey the order and surrender his governorship of Jiaozhi Commandery to Chen Shi. However, Shi Hui refused and had Huan Lin flogged to death. Huan Lin's nephew, Huan Fa (\u6853\u767c), started a mutiny against Shi Hui and engaged him in a battle that lasted a few months. They made peace after that.\n\nIn the meantime, after learning of Shi Hui's rebellion, Sun Quan ordered L\u00fc Dai, the Inspector of Guang Province, to lead troops to recapture Jiaozhi Commandery. L\u00fc Dai, who was close to Shi Hui's cousin Shi Kuang (\u58eb\u5321; a son of Shi Xie's brother Shi Yi \u58eb\u58f9), sent Shi Kuang to persuade Shi Hui to surrender by promising that he would be spared if he did so. Shi Hui and his brothers then opened the gates of Jiaozhi Commandery and surrendered to L\u00fc Dai. The following day, L\u00fc Dai lured the Shi brothers into a trap during a banquet, had them arrested and then read out a list of Shi Hui's crimes. He then executed all of them and sent their heads to Sun Quan, who was in Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]) at the time.\n\nShi Xie's brothers, Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9) and Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b), along with their families, were spared from death but reduced to the status of commoners. Some years later, Shi Yi and Shi Hui were executed for committing crimes.\n\nEarlier in the 220s, Shi Xie had sent his eldest son, Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure the Wu emperor of his allegiance towards him. Shi Xin thus avoided ending up like Shi Hui and his other brothers, who were executed by L\u00fc Dai in 227.

His ancestors moved to Jiao Province when [[Wang Mang]] usurped the throne and established the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323) with himself as its emperor. Shi Xie's father, Shi Ci (\u58eb\u8cdc), served as the Administrator of Rinan Commandery (\u65e5\u5357\u90e1) during the reign of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] ({{reign|146|168}}) of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The Shi family was one of the elite families of [[Han Chinese]] origin who later emigrated to present-day [[Vietnam]] and played a major role in developing Vietnamese civilisation.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\nIn his youth, Shi Xie studied the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' under the tutelage of one Liu Tao (\u5289\u9676) from [[Yingchuan Commandery]] (\u6f41\u5ddd\u90e1). Later, he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' (civil service candidate) and served in the Han central government as a Gentleman of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce) but was later dismissed because of \"official reasons\". After his father's death, he was nominated as a ''maocai'' (\u8302\u624d) and was appointed as the Prefect of Wu County (\u5deb\u7e23; present-day [[Wushan County, Chongqing]]). In 187, the Han central government reassigned him to be the Administrator (\u592a\u5b88) of Jiaozhi Commandery (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) in [[Jiao Province]].{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n==As a warlord in Jiao Province==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Shi Xie]]\n\nAround the time, Zhu Fu (\u6731\u7b26) had been appointed by the Han government to serve as the Inspector of [[Jiao Province]]. However, the locals in Jiao Province rebelled and killed him after he attempted to extract heavier taxes from them. The Han government then sent Zhang Jin (\u5f35\u6d25) to replace him, but Zhang Jin was later murdered by his subordinate Ou Jing (\u5340\u666f). When [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of [[Jing Province]], heard about this, he appointed Lai Gong (\u8cf4\u606d) as the new Inspector of Jiao Province without authorisation from the Han central government. At the same time, he also sent his subordinate Wu Ju (\u5433\u5de8) to replace the deceased Shi Huang (\u53f2\u749c) as the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (\u84bc\u68a7\u90e1). To counter Liu Biao's attempts to extend his influence into Jiao Province, the Han central government issued an imperial decree appointing Shi Xie as General of the Household Who Pacifies the South (\u7d8f\u5357\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07) and putting him in charge of the seven commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nAfter Shi Xie sent his subordinate Zhang Min (\u5f35\u65fb) to thank the Han central government and pay tribute, the Han central government further promoted him to General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (\u5b89\u9060\u5c07\u8ecd), in addition to enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Longdu Village (\u9f8d\u5ea6\u4ead\u4faf). Around the time, the Han Empire was in a state of chaos, as various warlords fought for power and territories in northern and central China. Jiao Province, being a remote province in southern China, was not caught up in the chaos. Shi Xie was effectively a warlord in control of Jiao Province even though he was still a nominal subject of the Han Empire. Shi Xie's younger brothers also held important positions in Jiao Province: Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9), Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b) and Shi Wu (\u58eb\u6b66) were respectively the Administrators of Hepu (\u5408\u6d66), Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77) commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nIn 210, Wu Ju got into conflict with Lai Gong and forced him out of Jiao Province. [[Sun Quan]], the warlord who controlled the territories in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region bordering Jiao Province, appointed his subordinate [[Bu Zhi]] as the Inspector of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship, but Wu Ju refused and secretly plotted to assassinate Bu Zhi. However, Bu Zhi sensed Wu Ju's intentions and managed to outwit and kill him. Sun Quan later appointed Shi Xie as General of the Left (\u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd) to honour him.

He taught music theory at the Berne Conservatory and the Z\u00fcrich Conservatory. His works include an opera, oratorios, cantatas, and many instrumental genres from piano pieces to symphonies.\n\n== Life ==\nBurkhard was born in [[Evilard]], [[Canton of Bern]].<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> He attended and graduated from a teachers' training college {{ill|Campus Muristalden|de|lt=Evangelisches Lehrerseminar Muristalden}}.<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> He also study with Ernst Graf, organist at the [[Berner M\u00fcnster]]. He moved to [[Leipzig]] to study piano with [[Robert Teichm\u00fcller]]<ref name=\"Wright\" /> and composition with [[Sigfrid Karg-Elert]].<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> After Leipzig, he moved on to Munich to study with [[Walter Courvoisier]]<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> and later to Paris to work with Max d'Ollone.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nFrom 1924, he began teaching composition, theory and the piano in Berne.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> He was appointed professor at the {{ill|Berne Conservatory|de|Musikschule Konservatorium Bern}} in 1928.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He conducted several choirs and small orchestras there.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> In 1932 he was struck with [[tuberculosis]],<ref name=\"Wright\" /> and was compelled to live for several years in Montana and Davos.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> During that time, he turned more towards composition.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He settled in Z\u00fcrich in 1942 and taught composition and music theory at the [[Zurich University of the Arts|Z\u00fcrich Conservatory]],<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> where his students included [[Klaus Huber]], [[Rudolf Kelterborn]], Ernst Pfiffner, [[Armin Schibler]] and {{ill|Ernst Widmer|de}}.<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> In 1950 he received a prize from the Schweizerischer Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein (Swiss Association of Musicians). He died in Z\u00fcrich in 1955 at the age of 55.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /><ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n== Work ==\nBurkhard published 98 works with [[Opus number]]s, and left a large amount of unpublished works held as manuscripts by the {{ill|Paul Sacher Foundation|de|Paul-Sacher-Stiftung}}. He began to compose in late-Romantic style. His personal style developed from 1930, comparable to [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]]. Late in life, he used some features of [[twelve-tone composition]], but remained within tonality.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He was interested to compose for voices, and regarded for renovated sacred music.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> <!--After his illness, the kindness and compassion that he received from his friends and loved ones led him to become deeply humbled and turn to religion. He wrote a large number of cantatas based on spiritual and biblical texts. Some of the reasons that he was partial to biblical texts were due to its simple yet interpretive language and its metrical forms.\n\nBurkhard was one of the most original and diverse composers of his generation; he wrote [[opera]]s, [[oratorio]]s, [[sonata]]s, [[Suite (music)|suites]], [[serenade]]s, [[cantata]]s, [[concerto]]s, organ music, orchestral music, and [[chamber music]].<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> Burkhard believed that it was the composer's mission to go out on a limb to create and discover new modes of expression by combining the old ones, but never following already set musical fashions. The trick was to create a new unique sound that resounded as one solid stylistic sound as that reflected some of what the composer's personality entailed. He would teach his students exactly this and never steer them away from their original findings.-->\n\nBurkhard is known for sacred choral music, including [[oratorio]]s ''Das Gesicht Jesajas'' ([[Isaiah]]'s vision) and ''Das Jahr'' (The year), and the cantata ''[[Die Sintflut]]'' (''[[Genesis flood narrative|The Flood]]''). He composed an opera, ''Die Schwarze Spinne'' based on [[Jeremias Gotthelf|Gotthelf]]'s novella ''[[The Black Spider]]''. He wrote song settings for solo voice and choirs, chamber music and piano works. His orchestral music was often dedicated to [[Paul Sacher]]'s Sinfonietta, including a Violin Concerto, and two symphonies.<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n=== Dramatic works ===\n* ''Im Zeichen des Kreuzes'', incidental music, 1938\u20139\n* ''Laupenspiel'', Op. 56, radio score, 1939\n* ''Oedipus rex'', Op. 72, incidental music to [[Oedipus Rex]] by [[Sophocles]], speaking choruses, wind instruments, timpani, 1944\n* ''Die schwarze Spinne'', text by R.

He taught music theory at the Berne Conservatory and the Z\u00fcrich Conservatory. His works include an opera, oratorios, cantatas, and many instrumental genres from piano pieces to symphonies.\n\n== Life ==\nBurkhard was born in [[Evilard]], [[Canton of Bern]].<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> He attended and graduated from a teachers' training college {{ill|Campus Muristalden|de|lt=Evangelisches Lehrerseminar Muristalden}}.<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> He also study with Ernst Graf, organist at the [[Berner M\u00fcnster]]. He moved to [[Leipzig]] to study piano with [[Robert Teichm\u00fcller]]<ref name=\"Wright\" /> and composition with [[Sigfrid Karg-Elert]].<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> After Leipzig, he moved on to Munich to study with [[Walter Courvoisier]]<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> and later to Paris to work with Max d'Ollone.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nFrom 1924, he began teaching composition, theory and the piano in Berne.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> He was appointed professor at the {{ill|Berne Conservatory|de|Musikschule Konservatorium Bern}} in 1928.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He conducted several choirs and small orchestras there.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> In 1932 he was struck with [[tuberculosis]],<ref name=\"Wright\" /> and was compelled to live for several years in Montana and Davos.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> During that time, he turned more towards composition.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He settled in Z\u00fcrich in 1942 and taught composition and music theory at the [[Zurich University of the Arts|Z\u00fcrich Conservatory]],<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> where his students included [[Klaus Huber]], [[Rudolf Kelterborn]], Ernst Pfiffner, [[Armin Schibler]] and {{ill|Ernst Widmer|de}}.<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> In 1950 he received a prize from the Schweizerischer Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein (Swiss Association of Musicians). He died in Z\u00fcrich in 1955 at the age of 55.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /><ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n== Work ==\nBurkhard published 98 works with [[Opus number]]s, and left a large amount of unpublished works held as manuscripts by the {{ill|Paul Sacher Foundation|de|Paul-Sacher-Stiftung}}. He began to compose in late-Romantic style. His personal style developed from 1930, comparable to [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]]. Late in life, he used some features of [[twelve-tone composition]], but remained within tonality.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /> He was interested to compose for voices, and regarded for renovated sacred music.<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> <!--After his illness, the kindness and compassion that he received from his friends and loved ones led him to become deeply humbled and turn to religion. He wrote a large number of cantatas based on spiritual and biblical texts. Some of the reasons that he was partial to biblical texts were due to its simple yet interpretive language and its metrical forms.\n\nBurkhard was one of the most original and diverse composers of his generation; he wrote [[opera]]s, [[oratorio]]s, [[sonata]]s, [[Suite (music)|suites]], [[serenade]]s, [[cantata]]s, [[concerto]]s, organ music, orchestral music, and [[chamber music]].<ref name=\"Sacher\" /> Burkhard believed that it was the composer's mission to go out on a limb to create and discover new modes of expression by combining the old ones, but never following already set musical fashions. The trick was to create a new unique sound that resounded as one solid stylistic sound as that reflected some of what the composer's personality entailed. He would teach his students exactly this and never steer them away from their original findings.-->\n\nBurkhard is known for sacred choral music, including [[oratorio]]s ''Das Gesicht Jesajas'' ([[Isaiah]]'s vision) and ''Das Jahr'' (The year), and the cantata ''Die Sintflut'' (''[[Genesis flood narrative|The Flood]]''). He composed an opera, ''Die Schwarze Spinne'' based on [[Jeremias Gotthelf|Gotthelf]]'s novella ''[[The Black Spider]]''. He wrote song settings for solo voice and choirs, chamber music and piano works. His orchestral music was often dedicated to [[Paul Sacher]]'s Sinfonietta, including a Violin Concerto, and two symphonies.<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n=== Dramatic works ===\n* ''Im Zeichen des Kreuzes'', incidental music, 1938\u20139\n* ''Laupenspiel'', Op. 56, radio score, 1939\n* ''Oedipus rex'', Op. 72, incidental music to [[Oedipus Rex]] by [[Sophocles]], speaking choruses, wind instruments, timpani, 1944\n* ''Die schwarze Spinne'', text by R.

The north-eastern part of the map is part of the parish of Shoreditch]]\nShoreditch covers a wide area, but its historic heart lies south of Old Street, around [[Shoreditch High Street]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch Church]]. The districts of [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] have been historically part of Shoreditch since the medieval period and occupy the north-west and north-east of Shoreditch respectively; however, their extent has never been formally defined.\n\nAlthough Shoreditch has been consistently defined, perceptions have blurred in recent years; something that became possible after the [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]] amalgamated with some of its neighbours to become the southern part of the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965.\n\nThe location of the former [[Shoreditch tube station]] (closed 2006), 400 metres outside Shoreditch proper, in nearby [[Bethnal Green]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], influenced this shift. Its replacement, [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street station]], straddles the borough boundary.\n\nMore significant has been the gentrification of the Shoreditch area since the millennium, leading to a marked increase in the area's prestige, which has led businesses in the [[Bethnal Green]] and [[Spitalfields]] areas of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] to include the name Shoreditch in their company's name and marketing material. This is also seen to a lesser extent in the [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] area of the [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Shoreditch Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|right|A map showing the wards of Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nShoreditch was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the [[Middle Ages]] until its merger into the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965. Shoreditch was based for many centuries on the [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Shoreditch (parish)|Shoreditch (St Leonard's)]], part of the county of [[Middlesex]].\n\nParishes in Middlesex were grouped into [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]], with Shoreditch part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Shoreditch part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The Tower Division was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref> - an arrangement which continued until 1899.\n\nThe [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parishes]] provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n \nFor civil purposes, The [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] turned turned the parish area into a new ''Shoreditch District of the Metropolis'', with the same boundaries as the parish. The [[London Government Act 1899]] converted these areas into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s, again based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations. The Borough's areas of Central Shoreditch, [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] were administered from Shoreditch Town Hall, which can still be seen on Old Street. It has been restored and is now run by the Shoreditch Town Hall Trust.\n\nIn 1965, Shoreditch was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n===Governance===\nShoreditch is home to the [[Nat Wei, Baron Wei|Baron of Shoreditch Wei]], who lives in the area and sits as a\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[life peer]] and [[Lords Temporal]] as [[Members of the House of Lords|part]] of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u8996\u983b\uff1a\u82f1\u570b\u83ef\u88d4\u7537\u7235\u97cb\u9cf4\u6069\u5c08\u8a2a\u4e00|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/multimedia/2010/06/100616_vid_nat_wei_1.shtml|work=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 September 2011|author=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|authorlink=BBC|date=17 June 2010|trans-title=Video: British Chinese baron Nat Wei Exclusive Interview 1}}</ref> He was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] on 3 June 2010.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59437 |date=3 June 2010 |page=10273 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100603-0001.htm#10060340000777 |title=House of Lords debates (3 June 2010, 11:00&nbsp;am): Introduction: Lord Wei |publisher=Hansard : House of Lords : 3 June 2010 : Column 365 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official portrait of Meg Hillier crop 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Official portrait of [[Meg Hillier]] ([[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]) of [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]].]]\nThe Hackney borough part of Shoreditch is part of the [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]] constituency, represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2005 by [[Meg Hillier]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of the [[Co-operative Party]]\n\nThe eastern part of Shoreditch, in Tower Hamlets, lies within the constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], represented since 2010 by [[Rushanara Ali]] of the Labour Party.\n\n== Notable local residents ==\n{{Main|List of people from Hackney}}\n*[[Andrew Weatherall]], DJ, producer, and remixer\n*[[Anissa Helou]], cookbook author, teacher and chef specialising in the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa\n*[[Barbara Windsor]], comedian, film and television actress was born there.\n*[[Bill Meyer (artist)|Bill Meyer]], printmaker and artist\n*[[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Playwright|dramatist]] lived in [[Norton Folgate]], the southern continuation of Shoreditch High Street, and wrote plays for the Shoreditch theatres.\n*[[Damien Hirst]], artist; instrumental in the development of the area's art scene in the early 1990s\n*[[Emmanuel Ray]], TV presenter/socialite\n*[[Henry Hate]], celebrity tattoo artist; clients include [[Boy George]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Pete Doherty]]\n*[[Hetty King]], a famous male impersonator of the [[music hall]], was born here.

Known also as the Old North Road, it was a major coaching route to the north, exiting the City at [[Bishopsgate]]. The east\u2013west course of Old Street\u2013Hackney Road was also probably originally a Roman Road, connecting [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] with [[Camulodunum|Colchester]], bypassing the City of London to the south.<ref>Sugden n.d.</ref>\n\nShoreditch Church (officially known as [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]) is of ancient origin. It is featured in the famous line \"when I grow rich say the bells of Shoreditch\", from the English nursery rhyme \"[[Oranges and Lemons]]\".\n\nShoreditch was the site of a house of canonesses, the [[Augustinian]] [[Holywell Priory]] (named after a Holy Well on the site), from the 12th century until its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1539. This priory was located between Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road to east and west, and Batemans Row and Holywell Lane to north and south.

Even so, they drew the wrath of contemporary moralists, as did the local \"base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort\" and the \"great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses\".<ref>Middlesex Justices in 1596; cited in Schoenbaum 1987, p. 126.</ref>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the 17th century, wealthy traders and French [[Huguenot]] silkweavers moved to the area, establishing a textile industry centred to the south around Spitalfields.

There was considerable rivalry with the West End theatres. John Douglass (the owner, from 1845) wrote a letter to ''The Era'' following a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] first night, in which he commented that \"seeing that a hansom cab is used in the new drama at Drury Lane, I beg to state that a hansom cab, drawn by a live horse was used in my drama ... produced at the Standard Theatre ... with real rain, a real flood, and a real balloon.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoreditch Theatres and Halls|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Shoreditch.htm|website=Arthur Lloyd|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* The Shoreditch Empire, also known as The London Music Hall, 95\u201399 Shoreditch High Street (1856\u20131935).

Often conflated with its neighbouring sub-district of Hoxton, the area has been subject to considerable [[gentrification]], with accompanying rises in land and property prices. Former industrial buildings have been converted to offices and flats, while Curtain Road and Old Street are notable for their clubs and pubs which offer a variety of venues to rival those of the West End. Art galleries, bars, restaurants, media businesses and the building of the [[Hackney Community College]] campus are features of this transformation.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the main streets of Shoreditch (Old Street, Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road, Great Eastern Street) were formed into a mile-long one-way system, which became associated with traffic congestion, poor conditions for walking and cycling, high speeds, high collision rates, and delays for bus services. The gyratory system came to be seen as \"the main factor holding back the cultural regeneration of South Shoreditch\"<ref>Teo Greenstraat of [[The Circus Space]], quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> and \"a block to economic recovery\".<ref>Michael Pyner of Shoreditch New Deal Trust, quoted in ''More Light, More Power'', No. 6, Autumn 2000.</ref> Following a lengthy campaign,<ref>[http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm ''The long road back to a two-way Shoreditch''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727072432/http://www.hackney-cyclists.org.uk/shoreditch.htm |date=27 July 2011 }} Hackney Cyclists, 2002.</ref> the then newly formed [[Transport for London]] agreed to revert most of the streets to two-way working, a project which was completed in late 2002.\n\n[[File:Shoreditch High Street stn entrance2 April2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shoreditch High Street railway station]], built as part of the [[East London Line extension]].]]\nIn 2005, funding was announced for the [[East London Line Extension]], to extend the existing tube line from [[Whitechapel tube station]] bypassing [[Shoreditch tube station]], and to create a new station named [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street]] closer to central Shoreditch.

These include [[Last.fm]], [[Dopplr]], [[Songkick]], [[SocialGO]] and [[7digital]]. These companies have tended to gravitate towards [[Old Street Roundabout]], giving rise to the term \"Silicon Roundabout\" to describe the area, as used by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] in a speech in November 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|title=Transcript: David Cameron sets out Britain's hi-tech future|author=Duncan Geere|magazine=Wired|access-date=9 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323164624/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/04/david-cameron-silicon-roundabout|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, the name of Shoreditch has become synonymous with the concept of contemporary \"[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsterfication]]\" of regenerated urban areas.

The north-eastern part of the map is part of the parish of Shoreditch]]\nShoreditch covers a wide area, but its historic heart lies south of Old Street, around [[Shoreditch High Street]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch Church]]. The districts of [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] have been historically part of Shoreditch since the medieval period and occupy the north-west and north-east of Shoreditch respectively; however, their extent has never been formally defined.\n\nAlthough Shoreditch has been consistently defined, perceptions have blurred in recent years; something that became possible after the [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]] amalgamated with some of its neighbours to become the southern part of the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965.\n\nThe location of the former [[Shoreditch tube station]] (closed 2006), 400 metres outside Shoreditch proper, in nearby [[Bethnal Green]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], influenced this shift. Its replacement, [[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street station]], straddles the borough boundary.\n\nMore significant has been the gentrification of the Shoreditch area since the millennium, leading to a marked increase in the area's prestige, which has led businesses in the [[Bethnal Green]] and [[Spitalfields]] areas of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] to include the name Shoreditch in their company's name and marketing material. This is also seen to a lesser extent in the [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] area of the [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Shoreditch Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|right|A map showing the wards of Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nShoreditch was an administrative unit with consistent boundaries from the [[Middle Ages]] until its merger into the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in 1965. Shoreditch was based for many centuries on the [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Shoreditch (parish)|Shoreditch (St Leonard's)]], part of the county of [[Middlesex]].\n\nParishes in Middlesex were grouped into [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]], with Shoreditch part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred. Rapid Population growth around London saw the Hundred split into several 'Divisions' during the 1600s, with Shoreditch part of the [[Tower division|Tower Division (aka Tower Hamlets)]]. The Tower Division was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] - and had done even before the creation of the Division<ref>The London Encyclopaedia, 4th Edition, 1983, Weinreb and Hibbert</ref> - an arrangement which continued until 1899.\n\nThe [[civil parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parishes]] provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the nineteenth century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. In London the Ecclesiastical Parishes sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the Civil Parishes continued to be based on the same Ancient Parish areas.\n \nFor civil purposes, The [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] turned turned the parish area into a new ''Shoreditch District of the Metropolis'', with the same boundaries as the parish. The [[London Government Act 1899]] converted these areas into [[Metropolitan Borough]]s, again based on the same boundaries, sometimes with minor rationalisations. The Borough's areas of Central Shoreditch, [[Hoxton]] and [[Haggerston]] were administered from Shoreditch Town Hall, which can still be seen on Old Street. It has been restored and is now run by the Shoreditch Town Hall Trust.\n\nIn 1965, Shoreditch was merged with [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the new [[London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n===Governance===\nShoreditch is home to the [[Nat Wei, Baron Wei|Baron of Shoreditch Wei]], who lives in the area and sits as a\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[life peer]] and [[Lords Temporal]] as [[Members of the House of Lords|part]] of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u8996\u983b\uff1a\u82f1\u570b\u83ef\u88d4\u7537\u7235\u97cb\u9cf4\u6069\u5c08\u8a2a\u4e00|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/multimedia/2010/06/100616_vid_nat_wei_1.shtml|work=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 September 2011|author=BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51|authorlink=BBC|date=17 June 2010|trans-title=Video: British Chinese baron Nat Wei Exclusive Interview 1}}</ref> He was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] on 3 June 2010.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59437 |date=3 June 2010 |page=10273 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100603-0001.htm#10060340000777 |title=House of Lords debates (3 June 2010, 11:00&nbsp;am): Introduction: Lord Wei |publisher=Hansard : House of Lords : 3 June 2010 : Column 365 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official portrait of Meg Hillier crop 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Official portrait of [[Meg Hillier]] ([[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]) of [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]].]]\nThe Hackney borough part of Shoreditch is part of the [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]] constituency, represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2005 by [[Meg Hillier]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of the [[Co-operative Party]]\n\nThe eastern part of Shoreditch, in Tower Hamlets, lies within the constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], represented since 2010 by [[Rushanara Ali]] of the Labour Party.\n\n== Notable local residents ==\n{{Main|List of people from Hackney}}\n*[[Andrew Weatherall]], DJ, producer, and remixer\n*[[Anissa Helou]], cookbook author, teacher and chef specialising in the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa\n*[[Barbara Windsor]], comedian, film and television actress was born there.\n*[[Bill Meyer (artist)|Bill Meyer]], printmaker and artist\n*[[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Playwright|dramatist]] lived in [[Norton Folgate]], the southern continuation of Shoreditch High Street, and wrote plays for the Shoreditch theatres.\n*[[Damien Hirst]], artist; instrumental in the development of the area's art scene in the early 1990s\n*[[Emmanuel Ray]], TV presenter/socialite\n*[[Henry Hate]], celebrity tattoo artist; clients include [[Boy George]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Pete Doherty]]\n*[[Hetty King]], a famous male impersonator of the [[music hall]], was born here.
