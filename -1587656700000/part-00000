The company was founded as '''Automated Simulations''' by Jim Connelley and [[Jon Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]], originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s. The company went [[bankrupt]] in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nIn 1977, Susan Lee-Merrow invited Jon Freeman to join a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] game hosted by Jim Connelley and Jeff Johnson. Connelley later purchased a [[Commodore PET]] computer to help with the bookkeeping involved in being a [[dungeon master]], and came up with the idea of writing a computer game for the machine before the end of the year so he could write it off on his taxes. Freeman had written on gaming for several publications, and joined Connelley in the design of a new space-themed wargame. Starting work around August 1978, Freeman wrote the basic rules, mission sets, background stories and the manual, while Connelley coded up the system in [[Commodore BASIC|PET BASIC]].<ref name=score>Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC&pg=PA54 \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Video Games\"], McGraw-Hill, 2003, pg. 54-55</ref>\n\n===The BASIC era===\nThe two formed Automated Simulations around Thanksgiving 1978 to market the game, and released it in December as ''[[Starfleet Orion]]''.<ref name=score/> Examining contemporary magazines (''Byte'' and ''Creative Computing'') suggests this is the first commercial space-themed wargame for a personal computer.{{efn|Non-commercial space war-games existed previously, notably ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Decwar]]''}} As the game was written in BASIC, it was easy to port to other [[home computer]]s of the era, starting with the [[TRS-80]] and then the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], the latter featuring rudimentary graphics. They followed this game with 1979's ''[[Invasion Orion]]'', which included a computer opponent so as not to require two human players.<ref name=score/>\n\nThe company's next release, ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'', was very  successful, selling over 20,000 copies.<ref>Paul Freiberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 \"This Company Is Serious about Games\"], ''[[InfoWorld]]'', 11 May 1981, pg. 10-11</ref> As the game was not a \"simulation\" of anything, the company introduced the Epyx [[brand name]] for these more action-oriented titles. Rated as the best computer game by practically every magazine of the era, ''Apshai'' was soon ported from the TRS-80 to additional systems, such as the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. ''Apshai'' spawned a number of similar adventure games based on the same game engine, including two direct sequels, branded under the ''Dunjonquest'' label. The games were so successful that they were later re-released in 1985 as the ''Temple of Apshai Trilogy''.\n\nUsing the same BASIC [[game engine]], a series of \"semi-action\" games followed under the Epyx brand, including ''[[Crush, Crumble and Chomp!]]'', ''[[Rescue at Rigel]]'', and ''[[Star Warrior]]'', each of which added twists to the ''Apshai'' engine.<ref name=score/>\n\n===Growth and action focus===\nFreeman became increasingly frustrated by Connelley's refusal to update the game engine. He left the company to start [[Free Fall Associates]] in 1981, leaving Connelley to lead what was now a large company. In 1983 the company assumed its brand name, becoming known simply as Epyx. Connelley reorganized his own development team as The Connelley Group, but continued to work under the Epyx umbrella, releasing ''[[Dragonriders of Pern (video game)|Dragonriders of Pern]]''. However 1983 was the year that ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]'' was released and became a big hit. Management decided the future was in action games, and Connelley eventually left the company, releasing games with other labels such as [[Br\u00f8derbund]].\n\nBy early 1984, ''InfoWorld'' estimated that Epyx was the world's 16th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $10 million in 1983 sales.<ref name=\"caruso19840402\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80\u201383}}</ref> Many successful action games followed, including the hits ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' and ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]''. The latter created a long run of successful sequels, including ''[[Summer Games II]]'', ''[[Winter Games]]'', ''[[California Games]]'', and ''[[World Games (video game)|World Games]]''. The company produced games based on licenses of ''[[Hot Wheels (video game)|Hot Wheels]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (video game)|G.I. Joe]]'', and ''[[Barbie (1984 video game)|Barbie]]''. In [[Europe]], [[U.S. Gold]] published Epyx games for the [[Commodore 64]], and also [[porting|port]]ed many of the games to other major European platforms such as the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].\n\n[[File:Epyx 500XJ.jpg|thumb|The Epyx 500XJ [[Atari CX40 joystick|Atari CX40]]-compatible joystick]]\n\nFor the [[Commodore 64]], Epyx made the [[Epyx Fast Load|Fast Load]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] which enables a fivefold speedup of [[floppy disk|floppy disk drive]] accesses through Commodore's very slow serial interface. Another hardware product was the Epyx 500XJ Joystick, which uses high-quality [[microswitch]]es and a more ergonomic [[wikt:form factor|form factor]] than the standard [[Atari CX40 joystick]] while remaining compatible.\n\nStarting in 1986, Epyx developed a color handheld game system, internally called the Handy. Unable to continue due to high costs, it was sold to [[Atari Corporation]] which brought it to market in 1989 as the [[Atari Lynx]].<ref>Peter Latimer, \"[https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_018#page/n21/mode/2up Atari Lynx]\", ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Volume 2 Issue 6 (July 2005), pg. 24\u201331</ref><ref name=\"maher20161222\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/12/a-time-of-endings-part-2-epyx/ |title=A Time of Endings, Part 2: Epyx |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |website=The Digital Antiquarian |publication-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\n===Litigation===\n{{main|Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1987, Epyx faced an important [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit from [[Data East|Data East USA]] regarding Epyx's Commodore 64 video game ''[[World Karate Championship (video game)|World Karate Championship]]''. Data East thought the whole game, and particularly the depiction of the referee, looked too much like its 1984 [[arcade game]] ''[[Karate Champ]]''. Data East won at the [[US District Court]] level and [[William Austin Ingram|Judge William Ingram]] ordered Epyx to recall all copies of ''World Karate Championship''. Epyx appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who reversed the judgment and ruled in favor of Epyx, stating that copyright protection did not extend to the idea of a tournament karate game, but specific artistic choices not dictated by that idea. The Court noted that a \"17.5 year-old boy\" could see clear differences between the elements of each game actually subject to copyright.<ref name=courtopinion>''[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/862/862.F2d.204.87-2294.html Data East USA, Inc. v.

Although the console market, dominated by the [[NES]], was highly lucrative, Epyx objected to [[Nintendo]]'s strict rules and licensing policies and instead initiated a failed attempt to develop their own game console.\n\nEpyx were unable to fulfill its contract with Atari to finish developing Lynx hardware and software, and the latter withheld payments that the former needed.{{r|maher20161222}} By the end of 1989, Epyx discontinued developing computer games, began making only [[console game]]s,<ref name=\"ferrell198912\">{{cite news|author=Ferrell, Keith|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Epyx Goes Diskless|date=December 1989|work=[[Compute!]]|accessdate=11 November 2013|url-status=live|pages=6}}</ref> and filed for [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].<ref name=\"wilson199111\">{{cite news|author=Wilson, Johnny L.|first=|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88|title=A History of Computer Games|date=November 1991|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=live|pages=10}}</ref> According to [[Stephen Landrum]], a long-time [[game programmer]] at Epyx, the company went bankrupt \"because it never really understood why it had been successful in the past, and then decided to branch out in a lot of directions, all of which turned out to be failures.\"<ref name='fomalhaut'>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504083458/http://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml|url=http://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml|title=Interview with Stephen H.

After emerging from bankruptcy the company resumed game development but only for the Lynx, with Atari acting as publisher.{{r|maher20161222}} In 1993, with eight employees left, they decided just to sell off the rest of the company. [[Bridgestone Media Group]] eventually acquired the rights the rest of Epyx's assets. Job offers were extended to the eight remaining employees, but only [[Peter Engelbrite]] accepted.\n\nIn 2006, British publisher [[System 3 (software company)|System 3]] announced it had licensed certain Epyx's assets on a time limited basis to release games such as ''[[California Games]]'' and ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' for [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[Wii]] in 2007.<ref>Brendan Sinclair, [http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/impossiblemission/news.html?sid=6156004 \"Epyx returns on Wii, PSP, DS\"], ''gamespot'', 17 August 2006</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===Games===\n{{Compact ToC|num=yes|short1|name=Directory|top=no|refs=no|extlinks=no|q=|v=|x=|y=|allowtoc=yes}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name  !!

The company was founded as '''Automated Simulations''' by Jim Connelley and [[Jon Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]], originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s. The company went [[bankrupt]] in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nIn 1977, Susan Lee-Merrow invited Jon Freeman to join a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] game hosted by Jim Connelley and Jeff Johnson. Connelley later purchased a [[Commodore PET]] computer to help with the bookkeeping involved in being a [[dungeon master]], and came up with the idea of writing a computer game for the machine before the end of the year so he could write it off on his taxes. Freeman had written on gaming for several publications, and joined Connelley in the design of a new space-themed wargame. Starting work around August 1978, Freeman wrote the basic rules, mission sets, background stories and the manual, while Connelley coded up the system in [[Commodore BASIC|PET BASIC]].<ref name=score>Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC&pg=PA54 \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Video Games\"], McGraw-Hill, 2003, pg. 54-55</ref>\n\n===The BASIC era===\nThe two formed Automated Simulations around Thanksgiving 1978 to market the game, and released it in December as ''[[Starfleet Orion]]''.<ref name=score/> Examining contemporary magazines (''Byte'' and ''Creative Computing'') suggests this is the first commercial space-themed wargame for a personal computer.{{efn|Non-commercial space war-games existed previously, notably ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Decwar]]''}} As the game was written in BASIC, it was easy to port to other [[home computer]]s of the era, starting with the [[TRS-80]] and then the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], the latter featuring rudimentary graphics. They followed this game with 1979's ''[[Invasion Orion]]'', which included a computer opponent so as not to require two human players.<ref name=score/>\n\nThe company's next release, ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'', was very  successful, selling over 20,000 copies.<ref>Paul Freiberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 \"This Company Is Serious about Games\"], ''[[InfoWorld]]'', 11 May 1981, pg. 10-11</ref> As the game was not a \"simulation\" of anything, the company introduced the Epyx [[brand name]] for these more action-oriented titles. Rated as the best computer game by practically every magazine of the era, ''Apshai'' was soon ported from the TRS-80 to additional systems, such as the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. ''Apshai'' spawned a number of similar adventure games based on the same game engine, including two direct sequels, branded under the ''Dunjonquest'' label. The games were so successful that they were later re-released in 1985 as the ''Temple of Apshai Trilogy''.\n\nUsing the same BASIC [[game engine]], a series of \"semi-action\" games followed under the Epyx brand, including ''[[Crush, Crumble and Chomp!]]'', ''[[Rescue at Rigel]]'', and ''[[Star Warrior]]'', each of which added twists to the ''Apshai'' engine.<ref name=score/>\n\n===Growth and action focus===\nFreeman became increasingly frustrated by Connelley's refusal to update the game engine. He left the company to start [[Free Fall Associates]] in 1981, leaving Connelley to lead what was now a large company. In 1983 the company assumed its brand name, becoming known simply as Epyx. Connelley reorganized his own development team as The Connelley Group, but continued to work under the Epyx umbrella, releasing ''[[Dragonriders of Pern (video game)|Dragonriders of Pern]]''. However 1983 was the year that ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]'' was released and became a big hit. Management decided the future was in action games, and Connelley eventually left the company, releasing games with other labels such as [[Br\u00f8derbund]].\n\nBy early 1984, ''InfoWorld'' estimated that Epyx was the world's 16th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $10 million in 1983 sales.<ref name=\"caruso19840402\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA80&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80\u201383}}</ref> Many successful action games followed, including the hits ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' and ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]''. The latter created a long run of successful sequels, including ''[[Summer Games II]]'', ''[[Winter Games]]'', ''[[California Games]]'', and ''[[World Games (video game)|World Games]]''. The company produced games based on licenses of ''[[Hot Wheels (video game)|Hot Wheels]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (video game)|G.I. Joe]]'', and ''[[Barbie (1984 video game)|Barbie]]''. In [[Europe]], [[U.S. Gold]] published Epyx games for the [[Commodore 64]], and also [[porting|port]]ed many of the games to other major European platforms such as the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].\n\n[[File:Epyx 500XJ.jpg|thumb|The Epyx 500XJ [[Atari CX40 joystick|Atari CX40]]-compatible joystick]]\n\nFor the [[Commodore 64]], Epyx made the [[Epyx Fast Load|Fast Load]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] which enables a fivefold speedup of [[floppy disk|floppy disk drive]] accesses through Commodore's very slow serial interface. Another hardware product was the Epyx 500XJ Joystick, which uses high-quality [[microswitch]]es and a more ergonomic [[wikt:form factor|form factor]] than the standard [[Atari CX40 joystick]] while remaining compatible.\n\nStarting in 1986, Epyx developed a color handheld game system, internally called the Handy. Unable to continue due to high costs, it was sold to [[Atari Corporation]] which brought it to market in 1989 as the [[Atari Lynx]].<ref>Peter Latimer, \"[https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_018#page/n21/mode/2up Atari Lynx]\", ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Volume 2 Issue 6 (July 2005), pg. 24\u201331</ref><ref name=\"maher20161222\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/12/a-time-of-endings-part-2-epyx/ |title=A Time of Endings, Part 2: Epyx |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |website=The Digital Antiquarian |publication-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\n===Litigation===\n{{main|Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1987, Epyx faced an important [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit from [[Data East|Data East USA]] regarding Epyx's Commodore 64 video game ''[[World Karate Championship (video game)|World Karate Championship]]''. Data East thought the whole game, and particularly the depiction of the referee, looked too much like its 1984 [[arcade game]] ''[[Karate Champ]]''. Data East won at the [[US District Court]] level and [[William Austin Ingram|Judge William Ingram]] ordered Epyx to recall all copies of ''World Karate Championship''. Epyx appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who reversed the judgment and ruled in favor of Epyx, stating that copyright protection did not extend to the idea of a tournament karate game, but specific artistic choices not dictated by that idea. The Court noted that a \"17.5 year-old boy\" could see clear differences between the elements of each game actually subject to copyright.<ref name=courtopinion>''[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/862/862.F2d.204.87-2294.html Data East USA, Inc. v.

Although the console market, dominated by the [[NES]], was highly lucrative, Epyx objected to [[Nintendo]]'s strict rules and licensing policies and instead initiated a failed attempt to develop their own game console.\n\nEpyx were unable to fulfill its contract with Atari to finish developing Lynx hardware and software, and the latter withheld payments that the former needed.{{r|maher20161222}} By the end of 1989, Epyx discontinued developing computer games, began making only [[console game]]s,<ref name=\"ferrell198912\">{{cite news|author=Ferrell, Keith|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Epyx Goes Diskless|date=December 1989|work=[[Compute!]]|accessdate=11 November 2013|url-status=live|pages=6}}</ref> and filed for [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].<ref name=\"wilson199111\">{{cite news|author=Wilson, Johnny L.|first=|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88|title=A History of Computer Games|date=November 1991|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=live|pages=10}}</ref> According to [[Stephen Landrum]], a long-time [[game programmer]] at Epyx, the company went bankrupt \"because it never really understood why it had been successful in the past, and then decided to branch out in a lot of directions, all of which turned out to be failures.\"<ref name='fomalhaut'>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504083458/http://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml|url=http://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml|title=Interview with Stephen H.

However, federal law regulates sex as listed on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, and other federal documents that list sex or name, such as the [[U.S. passport]].  [[Name change#United States|Laws concerning name changes in U.S. jurisdictions]] are also a complex mix of federal and state rules.  States vary in the extent to which they recognize [[transgender]] people's [[gender identity|gender identities]], often depending on the steps the person has taken in their [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]] (including [[psychological therapy]], [[hormone therapy]]), with some states making [[sex reassignment surgery]] a pre-requisite of recognition.\n\nAs of February 2019, the federal government has not codified any laws specifically protecting transgender people from discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare, and adoption, but some lawsuits argue that the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the federal constitution or federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender should be interpreted to include transgender people and discrimination based on [[gender identity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} U.S. President Barack Obama issued an [[executive order]] prohibiting discrimination against transgender people in employment by the federal government and its contractors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/21/obama-gay-rights_n_5605482.html|title=Obama Signs Executive Order On LGBT Job Discrimination|first=Jennifer|last=Bendery|date=July 21, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2017|via=Huff Post|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716171211/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/21/obama-gay-rights_n_5605482.html|archivedate=July 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  In 2016, the Departments of Education and Justice issued a letter to schools receiving federal funding that interpreted [[Title IX]] protection to apply to gender identity and transgender students, advising schools to use a student's preferred name and pronouns and to allow use of bathrooms and locker rooms of the student's gender identity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/transgender-bathrooms-obama-administration/index.html?adkey=bn|title=White House issues guidance on transgender bathrooms - CNNPolitics.com|author=Emanuella Grinberg, CNN|date=May 13, 2016|work=CNN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516031014/http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/transgender-bathrooms-obama-administration/index.html?adkey=bn|archivedate=May 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Recognition and protection against discrimination is provided by some state and local jurisdictions to varying degrees.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v.

The [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], of 2009, added crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], or [[disability]] to the federal definition of a [[hate crime]]. However, only some states and territories include gender identity in their hate crime laws.\n\n[[Genderqueer|Non-binary or genderqueer]] people may seek legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their birth sex; in 2016, [[Oregon]] became the first state to legally recognize non-binary people.<ref name=\"oregon\">{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Mary Emily|title='Nonbinary' is now a legal gender, Oregon court rules|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/oregon-court-rules-non-binary-gender-legal/|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=June 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610210014/http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/oregon-court-rules-non-binary-gender-legal/|archivedate=June 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When a person's gender is not officially recognized, they may seek associated changes, such as to their legal name, including on their birth certificate.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Marriage==\nIn ''[[Obergefell v.

While this is commonly understood as a ruling allowing same-sex marriage, it also meant that a person's sex, whether assigned at birth or recognized following transitioning, can not be used to determine their eligibility to marry. Prior to this ruling, the right of transgender people to marry was often subject to legal challenge \u2014 as was the status of their marriages after transitioning, particularly in cases where an individual's birth sex was interpreted to mean a [[same-sex marriage]] had taken place.<ref name=NYT1>{{cite news|author1=J.

The court may use chromosome makeup as one factor, but not the exclusive factor, in arriving at a decision. Aside from chromosomes, we adopt the criteria set forth by Professor Greenberg.

In some cases, a parent's transgender status is not weighed in a court decision; in others, rulings are made on the basis of a transgender person being presumed to be an inherently unfit parent.\n\nCourts are generally allowed to base custody or visitation rulings only on factors that directly affect the best interests of the child. According to this principle, if a transgender parent's gender identity cannot be shown to hurt the child, contact should not be limited, and other custody and visitation orders should not be changed for this reason. Many courts have upheld this principle and have treated transgender custody cases like any other child custody determination\u2014by focusing on standard factors such as parental skills. In ''Mayfield v. Mayfield'', for instance, the court upheld a transgender parent's [[shared parenting]] plan because there was no evidence in the record that the parent would not be a \"fit, loving and capable parent.\"<ref name=\"lambdalegal.org\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| title=FAQ About Transgender Parenting| work=Lambda Legal| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907132020/http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| archivedate=September 7, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther times, courts claiming to consider a child's interests have ruled against the transgender parent, leading to the parent losing access to their children on the basis of their [[gender identity]]. For example, in ''Cisek v. Cisek'', the court terminated a transgender parent's visitation rights, holding that there was a risk of both mental and \"social harm\" to the children. The court asked whether the parent's [[sex change]] was \"simply an indulgence of some fantasy\". An Ohio court imposed an indefinite moratorium on visitation based on the court's belief that it would be emotionally confusing for the children to see \"their father as a woman\".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Cisek v.

Different procedures and requirements for legal name changes and gender marker changes on [[birth certificate]]s, [[drivers license]]s, social security identification and [[passport]]s exist and can be inconsistent.  Many states require [[sex reassignment surgery]] to change their name and gender marker.  Also, documents which do not match each other can present difficulties in conducting personal affairs - particularly those which require multiple, matching forms of identification.

This potentially significant change in the law was not tested until ''Smith v. City of Salem'' 378 F.3d 566, 568 (6th Cir. 2004). Smith, a trans woman, had been employed as a lieutenant in the fire department without incident for seven years. After doctors diagnosed Smith with [[Gender Identity Disorder]] (\"GID\"), she began to experience harassment and retaliation following complaint. She filed Title VII claims of sex discrimination and retaliation, equal protection and due process claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and state law claims of invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy. On appeal, the ''Price Waterhouse'' precedent was applied at p574: \"[i]t follows that employers who discriminate against men because they do wear dresses and makeup, or otherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination, because the discrimination would not occur but for the victim's sex.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=SMITH v.

By reiterating that discrimination based on both sex and gender expression is forbidden under Title VII, the court steers transgender jurisprudence in a more expansive direction.  But dress codes, which frequently have separate rules based solely on gender, continue. ''Carroll v. Talman Fed. Savs. & Loan Association'', 604 F.2d 1028, 1032 (7th Cir.) 1979, has not been overruled.\n\n[[Harrah's]] implemented a policy named \"Personal Best\", in which it dictated a general dress code for its male and female employees. Females were required to wear makeup, and there were similar rules for males. One female employee, Darlene Jesperson, objected and sued under Title VII. In ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's|Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. April 14, 2006), plaintiff conceded that dress codes could be legitimate but that certain aspects could nevertheless be demeaning; plaintiff also cited ''Price Waterhouse''.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, upholding the practice of business-related gender-specific dress codes. When such a dress code is in force, an employee amid transition could find it impossible to obey the rules.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn ''[[Glenn v.

In some cases, a parent's transgender status is not weighed in a court decision; in others, rulings are made on the basis of a transgender person being presumed to be an inherently unfit parent.\n\nCourts are generally allowed to base custody or visitation rulings only on factors that directly affect the best interests of the child. According to this principle, if a transgender parent's gender identity cannot be shown to hurt the child, contact should not be limited, and other custody and visitation orders should not be changed for this reason. Many courts have upheld this principle and have treated transgender custody cases like any other child custody determination\u2014by focusing on standard factors such as parental skills. In ''Mayfield v. Mayfield'', for instance, the court upheld a transgender parent's [[shared parenting]] plan because there was no evidence in the record that the parent would not be a \"fit, loving and capable parent.\"<ref name=\"lambdalegal.org\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| title=FAQ About Transgender Parenting| work=Lambda Legal| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907132020/http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| archivedate=September 7, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther times, courts claiming to consider a child's interests have ruled against the transgender parent, leading to the parent losing access to their children on the basis of their [[gender identity]]. For example, in ''Cisek v. Cisek'', the court terminated a transgender parent's visitation rights, holding that there was a risk of both mental and \"social harm\" to the children. The court asked whether the parent's [[sex change]] was \"simply an indulgence of some fantasy\".

This potentially significant change in the law was not tested until ''Smith v. City of Salem'' 378 F.3d 566, 568 (6th Cir. 2004). Smith, a trans woman, had been employed as a lieutenant in the fire department without incident for seven years. After doctors diagnosed Smith with [[Gender Identity Disorder]] (\"GID\"), she began to experience harassment and retaliation following complaint. She filed Title VII claims of sex discrimination and retaliation, equal protection and due process claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and state law claims of invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy. On appeal, the ''Price Waterhouse'' precedent was applied at p574: \"[i]t follows that employers who discriminate against men because they do wear dresses and makeup, or otherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination, because the discrimination would not occur but for the victim's sex.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=SMITH v.

By reiterating that discrimination based on both sex and gender expression is forbidden under Title VII, the court steers transgender jurisprudence in a more expansive direction.  But dress codes, which frequently have separate rules based solely on gender, continue. ''Carroll v. Talman Fed.

Females were required to wear makeup, and there were similar rules for males. One female employee, Darlene Jesperson, objected and sued under Title VII. In ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's|Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. April 14, 2006), plaintiff conceded that dress codes could be legitimate but that certain aspects could nevertheless be demeaning; plaintiff also cited ''Price Waterhouse''.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, upholding the practice of business-related gender-specific dress codes. When such a dress code is in force, an employee amid transition could find it impossible to obey the rules.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn ''[[Glenn v.
