A typical introduction to his videos is \"Greetings, children, Captain Disillusion here.\" Secondly, he goes on to show a popular video, often a paranormal or viral video which is 'too good to be true.' (He sometimes even uses humorous topics at the beginning of his videos to get people into the mood and then uses his wristband to lead him to talk about the real topic.) Thirdly, he reviews the footage, utilizing his expertise in digital editing, to 'break down' the video and show how the end result was accomplished. He also likes to recreate effects from the videos he debunks, often incorporating this into episodes.<ref name=skepticzone2017>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |title=The Skeptic Zone #477 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=10 December 2017 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=1 February 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131428/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |archivedate=17 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe ends each video with his motto: \"Love with your heart.

He notes that [[Penn & Teller]] were instrumental to his current interest and eventually found the skeptical movement involved in similar work. He finds that his followers like to learn about the illusions. It is not his intent to spoil legitimate entertainment or spoil a current performers work. His intent in showing how video illusions are created is to clear up misconceptions. Melikdjanian describes the basis for Openfilm.com briefly, saying it \"was formed for film makers. The goal is to provide higher quality product and a group of serious content creators.\"\n\nDuring an interview for ''[[The Skeptic Zone]]'', in 2010, he describes Captain Disillusion as a superhero.<ref name=\"Skeptic Zone 2010\"/> and in a following 2011 interview, he describes his work as Captain Disillusion is done \"in the maximum fun way possible\".<ref>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |title=The Skeptic Zone #146 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=August 6, 2011 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220124427/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 }}</ref> He describes his work with [[James Randi]], Randi calling him to participate in The Amaz!ng Meeting and his video work with Randi in a later project.

It's all about making things look questionable and kinda crappy and low quality and then you can pretty much get away with anything\". In replying to a follow up question regarding believing what you see on the internet he said \"When I started out, people just kinda believed everything, it was like shooting fish in a barrel, but these days people are just really asking me \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\" and half the stuff they show me is just you know, a juggler juggling a lot of balls. They can't conceive that that could be real, people just don't believe anything anymore. I guess that's good for me because I get to explain lots of stuff but I wish people could finally strike that balance where they're not too credulous but they also know not to just dismiss everything out of hand\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Saunders|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Saunders (skeptic)|title=The Skeptic Zone #477 - 10.Dec.2017|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|publisher=The Skeptic Zone|format=Podcast|accessdate=17 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417062715/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|archivedate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Credits==\n\n===Filmography===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1984\n| ''Shutki v storonu''\n| actor\n| Russian for ''Jokes Aside'' (scenes deleted)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2001\n| ''The Realm''\n| director, composer\n| \n|-\n| ''The Monster Man''\n| editor\n|\n|-\n| ''Zelimo''\n| animator\n| Directed by Aleks Rosenberg,<br>Won\u2014WorldFest-Houston Gold Special Jury Award for Best Feature\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''Sin neudachnika''\n| editor<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Cast & Crew of Sin neudachnika|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDB|accessdate=February 18, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706145526/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|archivedate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n| Russian for ''Son of a Loser'' (Television film)\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Citizen Mavzik]]''\n| director, writer, editor, composer\n| (DVD) Co-written with father, Vilen.

A typical introduction to his videos is \"Greetings, children, Captain Disillusion here.\" Secondly, he goes on to show a popular video, often a paranormal or viral video which is 'too good to be true.' (He sometimes even uses humorous topics at the beginning of his videos to get people into the mood and then uses his wristband to lead him to talk about the real topic.) Thirdly, he reviews the footage, utilizing his expertise in digital editing, to 'break down' the video and show how the end result was accomplished. He also likes to recreate effects from the videos he debunks, often incorporating this into episodes.<ref name=skepticzone2017>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |title=The Skeptic Zone #477 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=10 December 2017 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=1 February 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131428/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |archivedate=17 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe ends each video with his motto: \"Love with your heart.

He notes that [[Penn & Teller]] were instrumental to his current interest and eventually found the skeptical movement involved in similar work. He finds that his followers like to learn about the illusions. It is not his intent to spoil legitimate entertainment or spoil a current performers work. His intent in showing how video illusions are created is to clear up misconceptions. Melikdjanian describes the basis for Openfilm.com briefly, saying it \"was formed for film makers. The goal is to provide higher quality product and a group of serious content creators.\"\n\nDuring an interview for ''[[The Skeptic Zone]]'', in 2010, he describes Captain Disillusion as a superhero.<ref name=\"Skeptic Zone 2010\"/> and in a following 2011 interview, he describes his work as Captain Disillusion is done \"in the maximum fun way possible\".<ref>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |title=The Skeptic Zone #146 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=August 6, 2011 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220124427/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 }}</ref> He describes his work with [[James Randi]], Randi calling him to participate in The Amaz!ng Meeting and his video work with Randi in a later project.

It's all about making things look questionable and kinda crappy and low quality and then you can pretty much get away with anything\". In replying to a follow up question regarding believing what you see on the internet he said \"When I started out, people just kinda believed everything, it was like shooting fish in a barrel, but these days people are just really asking me \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\" and half the stuff they show me is just you know, a juggler juggling a lot of balls. They can't conceive that that could be real, people just don't believe anything anymore. I guess that's good for me because I get to explain lots of stuff but I wish people could finally strike that balance where they're not too credulous but they also know not to just dismiss everything out of hand\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Saunders|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Saunders (skeptic)|title=The Skeptic Zone #477 - 10.Dec.2017|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|publisher=The Skeptic Zone|format=Podcast|accessdate=17 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417062715/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|archivedate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Credits==\n\n===Filmography===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1984\n| ''Shutki v storonu''\n| actor\n| Russian for ''Jokes Aside'' (scenes deleted)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2001\n| ''The Realm''\n| director, composer\n| \n|-\n| ''The Monster Man''\n| editor\n|\n|-\n| ''Zelimo''\n| animator\n| Directed by Aleks Rosenberg,<br>Won\u2014WorldFest-Houston Gold Special Jury Award for Best Feature\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''Sin neudachnika''\n| editor<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Cast & Crew of Sin neudachnika|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDB|accessdate=February 18, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706145526/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|archivedate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n| Russian for ''Son of a Loser'' (Television film)\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Citizen Mavzik]]''\n| director, writer, editor, composer\n| (DVD) Co-written with father, Vilen.

The first exon and the last part of exon 10 are not translated. A main transcript of 2.8 kb has been described in a large variety of human tissues (pancreas, thymus, adrenal glands, thyroid, testis, leukocytes, heart, brain, lung, muscle, small intestine, liver, and kidney); an additional transcript of approximately 4 kb has been detected in pancreas and thymus, suggesting a tissue-specific alternative splicing.\n\n=== The Menin Protein ===\nMenin is a 610 amino acid (67Kda) nuclear protein, highly conserved from mouse (98%), rat (97%) and, more distantly, zebrafish (75%) and Drosophila (47%) (47-51). Human and mouse MEN1 amino acid sequences share 95.8% identity and 98.4% similarity. Analysis of menin amino acid sequence did not reveal homologies to any other known human or mammalian protein, sequence motif, or signal peptide. The absence of significant homology to any other protein complicates efforts to elucidate the functions of menin.\n\n=== Pathophysiology ===\n''MEN1'' follows Knudson\u2019s \u201ctwo-hit\u201d model for tumor suppressor gene carcinogenesis (30). The first hit is a heterozygous MEN1 germline mutation, inherited from one parent (familial cases) or developed in an early embryonic stage (sporadic cases) and present in all cells at birth. The second hit is a MEN1 somatic mutation, usually a large deletion, that occurs in the predisposed endocrine cell as loss of the remaining wild-type allele and gives cells the survival advantage needed for tumor development.\n\n=== Mnemonic ===\nA useful mnemonic to remember the associated neoplasias is below:\n\nMEN I '''(3 Ps)''' - Pituitary, Parathyroid, Pancreatic<br>\nMEN IIa '''(2Ps, 1M)''' - [[Pheochromocytoma]], Parathyroid, Medullary Thyroid Ca<br>\nMEN IIb '''(1P, 2Ms)''' - Pheochromocytoma, Medullary Thyroid Ca, [[Marfanoid habitus]]/mucosal neuroma\n\n=== ''MEN1'' mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia patients and clinical genetics ===\n''MEN1'' gene mutations can be identified in 70-95% of MEN1 patients and in about 20% of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism cases. Almost all patients are heterozygous for mutations. One affected family has been identified with individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MEN1 mutations. In this family, there was no difference in disease history between the homozygous and heterozygous mutation carriers.\n\nFifty percent of patients develop signs and symptoms by 20 years of age and more than 95% have symptoms by 40 years of age. There is significant intra- and inter-familial variability in the age of onset, severity of disease, and tumor types. Despite numerous studies, no genotype-phenotype correlations have been established, suggesting that unknown genetic and environmental modifiers are involved in the expression of the MEN1 phenotype.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=famcan&part=ch1famcan |title= Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1: In Familial Cancer Syndromes.

NCBI 2009|accessdate=2009-09-11 |format= |website=}}</ref> Other endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms including adrenocortical and thyroid tumors, visceral and cutaneous lipomas, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas and collagenomas, and thymic, gastric, and bronchial carcinoids also occur. The phenotype of MEN1 is broad, and over 20 different combinations of endocrine and non-endocrine manifestations have been described. MEN1 should be suspected in patients with an endocrinopathy of two of the three characteristic affected organs, or with an endocrinopathy of one of these organs plus a first-degree relative affected by MEN1 syndrome.\n\nMEN1 patients usually have a family history of MEN1. Inheritance is autosomal dominant; any affected parent has a 50% chance to transmit the disease to his or her progeny. MEN1 gene mutations can be identified in 70-95% of MEN1 patients.\n\nMany endocrine tumors in MEN1 are benign and cause symptoms by overproduction of hormones or local mass effects, while other MEN1 tumors are associated with an elevated risk for malignancy. About one third of patients affected with MEN1 will die early from an MEN1-related cancer or associated malignancy. Entero-pancreatic gastrinomas and thymic and bronchial carcinoids are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Consequently, the average age of death in untreated individuals with MEN1 is significantly lower (55.4 years for men and 46.8 years for women) than that of the general population.\n\n=== Recommended cancer surveillance ===\nA recommend surveillance program for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 has been suggested by the International Guidelines for Diagnosis and Therapy of MEN syndromes group. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=famcan&part=ch3famcan&rendertype=table&id=ch3famcan.T6|title= Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1: In Familial Cancer Syndromes.

The first exon and the last part of exon 10 are not translated. A main transcript of 2.8 kb has been described in a large variety of human tissues (pancreas, thymus, adrenal glands, thyroid, testis, leukocytes, heart, brain, lung, muscle, small intestine, liver, and kidney); an additional transcript of approximately 4 kb has been detected in pancreas and thymus, suggesting a tissue-specific alternative splicing.\n\n=== The Menin Protein ===\nMenin is a 610 amino acid (67Kda) nuclear protein, highly conserved from mouse (98%), rat (97%) and, more distantly, zebrafish (75%) and Drosophila (47%) (47-51). Human and mouse MEN1 amino acid sequences share 95.8% identity and 98.4% similarity. Analysis of menin amino acid sequence did not reveal homologies to any other known human or mammalian protein, sequence motif, or signal peptide. The absence of significant homology to any other protein complicates efforts to elucidate the functions of menin.\n\n=== Pathophysiology ===\n''MEN1'' follows Knudson\u2019s \u201ctwo-hit\u201d model for tumor suppressor gene carcinogenesis (30). The first hit is a heterozygous MEN1 germline mutation, inherited from one parent (familial cases) or developed in an early embryonic stage (sporadic cases) and present in all cells at birth. The second hit is a MEN1 somatic mutation, usually a large deletion, that occurs in the predisposed endocrine cell as loss of the remaining wild-type allele and gives cells the survival advantage needed for tumor development.\n\n=== Mnemonic ===\nA useful mnemonic to remember the associated neoplasias is below:\n\nMEN I '''(3 Ps)''' - Pituitary, Parathyroid, Pancreatic<br>\nMEN IIa '''(2Ps, 1M)''' - [[Pheochromocytoma]], Parathyroid, Medullary Thyroid Ca<br>\nMEN IIb '''(1P, 2Ms)''' - Pheochromocytoma, Medullary Thyroid Ca, [[Marfanoid habitus]]/mucosal neuroma\n\n=== ''MEN1'' mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia patients and clinical genetics ===\n''MEN1'' gene mutations can be identified in 70-95% of MEN1 patients and in about 20% of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism cases. Almost all patients are heterozygous for mutations. One affected family has been identified with individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MEN1 mutations. In this family, there was no difference in disease history between the homozygous and heterozygous mutation carriers.\n\nFifty percent of patients develop signs and symptoms by 20 years of age and more than 95% have symptoms by 40 years of age. There is significant intra- and inter-familial variability in the age of onset, severity of disease, and tumor types. Despite numerous studies, no genotype-phenotype correlations have been established, suggesting that unknown genetic and environmental modifiers are involved in the expression of the MEN1 phenotype.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=famcan&part=ch1famcan |title= Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1: In Familial Cancer Syndromes.

NCBI 2009|accessdate=2009-09-11 |format= |website=}}</ref> Other endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms including adrenocortical and thyroid tumors, visceral and cutaneous lipomas, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas and collagenomas, and thymic, gastric, and bronchial carcinoids also occur. The phenotype of MEN1 is broad, and over 20 different combinations of endocrine and non-endocrine manifestations have been described. MEN1 should be suspected in patients with an endocrinopathy of two of the three characteristic affected organs, or with an endocrinopathy of one of these organs plus a first-degree relative affected by MEN1 syndrome.\n\nMEN1 patients usually have a family history of MEN1. Inheritance is autosomal dominant; any affected parent has a 50% chance to transmit the disease to his or her progeny. MEN1 gene mutations can be identified in 70-95% of MEN1 patients.\n\nMany endocrine tumors in MEN1 are benign and cause symptoms by overproduction of hormones or local mass effects, while other MEN1 tumors are associated with an elevated risk for malignancy. About one third of patients affected with MEN1 will die early from an MEN1-related cancer or associated malignancy. Entero-pancreatic gastrinomas and thymic and bronchial carcinoids are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Consequently, the average age of death in untreated individuals with MEN1 is significantly lower (55.4 years for men and 46.8 years for women) than that of the general population.\n\n=== Recommended cancer surveillance ===\nA recommend surveillance program for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 has been suggested by the International Guidelines for Diagnosis and Therapy of MEN syndromes group. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=famcan&part=ch3famcan&rendertype=table&id=ch3famcan.T6|title= Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1: In Familial Cancer Syndromes.
