Retrieved on 21 December 2018.</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPicking up from the prequel, the film starts off with Maariyappan aka Maari ([[Dhanush]]) as the fun-loving gangster with his sidekicks Sanikkizhamai aka Sani ([[Robo Shankar]]) and Robert aka Adithangi ({{literal translation}} punching bag) ([[Kalloori Vinoth]]). Maari is chased around by Araathu Aanandi ([[Sai Pallavi]]), a \"[[loosu ponnu]]\" ({{literal translation}} crazy girl) [[auto driver]] who is head over heels in love with him. However, try as she might, Maari does not give her a second glance and constantly shows his annoyance to her. \n\nIn a parallel storyline, Gangadhar Beeja ([[Tovino Thomas]]) is shown to have escaped from jail with the cell walls scrawled with the words \"Kill Maari\". He is out for revenge, as his brother ([[Vincent Asokan]]), who was a lawyer, promised to get Beeja released from jail. Unfortunately, his brother is killed at the hands of Maari as the former tried to [[sexual abuse|molest]] Aanandi's elder sister. This is also the reason why Aanandi loves Maari.\n\nMaari gets his 100th murder attempt on his life by his rival Singayya, and to celebrate, Kalai ([[Krishna (Tamil actor)|Krishna]]), Sani, and Adithangi throw Maari a party. While coming back, Maari gets attacked, and Aanandi takes him to the hospital and takes care of him.\n\nKalai's brother Vallavan is shown to be a hand-in-glove with Singayya, who has formed an alliance with Beeja to overthrow Maari. As per Beeja's plan, Vallavan asks Sani to send Aanandi for a job, which turns out to be [[drug smuggling]], a job which Maari hates. Aanandi goes to do the job and gets caught by Kalai. On confronting Aanandi, she tells him that Maari asked her to do it. This sparks a doubt in Kalai's mind. Vallavan is caught by Maari carrying the drugs, and when Maari confronts Kalai, a fight erupts. Maari and his sidekicks set fire to all the drugs, and Beeja kills Vallavan to make it look as if Maari killed him. Kalai gets enraged and orders his men to kill Maari. Maari is injured in the battle, and Beeja reveals himself as the perpetrator. Beeja then shoots Maari, but Maari is saved by Aanandi, who took the bullet for him, which ended up in her lower [[spinal cord]], [[paralysis|paralysing]] her legs for life. \n\nThe new collector, Vijaya Chamundeshwari IAS ([[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]]), comes out to restore order and stop all gang violence. Maari goes into hiding with Aanandi, whose legs are paralysed. Eight years pass, and Beeja and Kalai have grown to become rich dons, but when Kalai has clear chance to become the [[Member of Legislative Assembly|MLA]] candidate of the ruling party, Beeja usurps that chance by threatening Kalai and his family. Vijaya, now the Deputy-Home secretary, in an effort to find Maari, posts his picture along with Aanandi's on newspapers. Maari sees this and meets Vijaya, requesting her to remove the photos. Maari then reveals that he was living in Tenkasi with an elderly couple. Aanandi got pregnant, and a healthy baby boy was born. However, due to complications by the paralysis, Aanandi dies minutes after childbirth. Maari then raises the boy, called Kaali (Master Raghavan) with help from the old couple and Sani. Kaali is shown to have inherited his father's behaviour and keeps picking fights in school. Maari then requests Vijaya to stop coming after him (as a request) and says that he changed his ways. When Kaali sees some students in the older grade teasing a teacher, he complains to the principal. In retribution, the boys chase him and try to teach him a lesson, only to get beaten black and blue by Kaali. The area member of council (Stalin), one of the boys' father, calls Kaali to hit him, but Maari goes and begs for forgiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, the city [[police commissioner]] ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) mentions to the media that there is an informer within Beeja's gang. Using his moles in the police department, Beeja tries to figure out who the mole is but fails. It is then revealed that there was not any mole and that the whole story was fabricated to identify the corrupt policemen in the department, including the commissioner. Also, Beeja has been in ties with the commissioner and was the mole himself. He had been leaking info about his men so that he may come out clear to become an MLA candidate. It is also revealed that despite begging for forgiveness, the counsellor insisted on his son beating up Kaali, and so, Maari beats up the counsellor and his henchmen. In a final encounter, the police turns against Beeja. Maari fights Beeja and paralyses his legs for revenge for Aanandi and reveals to him that Maari killed his brother because Beeja could be killed by his own brother for property. Soon Beeja gets sentenced for life term prison. Maari is then shown with his sidekicks continuing his old life.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dhanush]] as Maari or Maariyappan\n* [[Krishna (Tamil actor)|Krishna]] as Kalai\n* [[Tovino Thomas]] as Gangadhar Beeja ([[Thanatos]])\n* [[Sai Pallavi]] as Araathu Aanandi/Aanandi Maariyappan\n* [[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]] as Vijaya Chamundeswari\n* [[Vidya Pradeep]] as Kalai's wife\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Sanikkizhamai (Sani)\n* [[Kalloori Vinoth]] as Robert (Adithangi)\n* [[Kaali Venkat]] as Aarumugam\n* Master Raghavan as Kaali\n* [[Aadukalam Naren]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[E.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

[[Reckitt Benckiser]], the owner of the Lysol brand, responded stating that \"coronavirus\" is the name of [[coronavirus|an entire family of viruses]] (known to exist for many decades) of which the [[pathogen]] responsible for the 2019 pandemic ([[SARS-CoV-2]]) is a new [[mutation]].

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

He was a warrior Hindu prince and de facto head of the kingdom of [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]], otherwise known as Cotiote, in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], India, between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British [[East India Company]] is known as the [[Cotiote War]]. He is popularly known as '''''Kerala Simham''''' ('''''Lion of Kerala''''') on account of his martial exploits.\n\nPazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|occupied Malabar]] in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in [[Travancore]]. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the ''de facto'' heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects.\n\nIn 1792, after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. [[Vira Varma]], to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border.\n\n==Kingdom==\nPazhassi Raja was born in the Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar not [[Kottayam]] District in south Kerala. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of [[Mattannur]]. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British documents wrote ''Pazhassi Raja'' as ''Pychy Rajah'', while the name ''Cotiote Raja'' comes from the anglicizing of ''Kottayam'' to ''Cotiote''. Kottayam covers what is today the [[Thalassery]] taluk of the [[Kannur District]] and [[Wayanad district]], along with the [[Gudalur, Nilgiris|Gudalur]] taluk of [[Nilgiris district]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=24}}\n\nAs a royal clan, Purannattu Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wayanad \u2013 Its People and Traditions by C. Gopalan Nair</ref>\n\n==Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773\u20131793)==\nPazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was [[Hyder Ali]]. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of [[Tipu Sultan]], son and successor of Hyder Ali.\n\n===Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773\u20131782)===\nIn 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time,{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=295}} for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after war in 1768. Most of the ''Rajas'' of Malabar, along with many ''Naduvazhis'' or vassals fled to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organised resistances. The Malabari partisans made excellent use of the wooded hills that covered most of Malabar during this rebellion.\n\nIn 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali's troops, and stayed in Kottayam{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}} , where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=58}}\n\nOnce the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named [[Vira Varma]] and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.\n\nThe military situation was grim for ''Pazhassi Raja'' and his troops&nbsp;\u2013 in 1774, [[Kodagu|Coorgs]] had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal {{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=295}} and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=24}} This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nDuring his long war with the Mysore and then the English East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district&nbsp;\u2013 as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]] and [[Krishna Varma]], who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.\n\n====Siege of Thalasseri====\n[[Thalassery|Thalasseri]] or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the British naval situation on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the British in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military power at a regional basis.\n\nSo in 1778, Hyder's vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=296}} The British factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]] army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=27}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}}\n\nBy the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=296}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}} Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murland|first1=Lieutenant Colonel HF|title=Baillie-Ki-Paltan: A History of the 2nd Battalion, Madras Pioneers 1759 - 1930|date=2005|publisher=The Naval and Military Press Ltd|location=East Sussex|page=48}}</ref> Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja's help that enabled the British to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi&nbsp;\u2013 his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that his possessions in Malabar be restored.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}} This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja's troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}}\n\n===Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784\u20131793)===\nBy 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the British recognised [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}} The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Tiyar/Izhava) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.<ref>Calicut University Text for paper Kerala History and Culture Distance Education MA History 2007 by Prof. SS Warrier</ref>{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nWhat angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years&nbsp;\u2013 till 1793&nbsp;\u2013 when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja's hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter's policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission\u2014the extermination of the [[Nair]] caste from Kottayam to Palakkad&nbsp;\u2013 as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nThe senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore's onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja's resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788:\n\n{{Quote|Between 1787 and 1788, the ''thampurans'' or Rajahs of Malabar, threatened by the forces of Tipu, fled to Travancore. Among them were the princes of Kottayathu.....The Senior Rajah before his flight summoned Kerala Varma, the youngest prince, and instructed him to protect the country. Accordingly, the latter assembled the inhabitants, retired to the jungles and assisted them in the development of a new homeland.  Frequently, in defiance to the authority of the Sultan, he with a band of determined followers issued forth from the woods and levied contributions.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=90}}}}\n\nBut in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 [[Nair]]s to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery).{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=31}} After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=32}} Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the British. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the British and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}}  The British then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This was where the British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land.<ref>Evolution of Kerala History and Culture, Prof. T.

Rajas were now stripped of their right to rule as they willed; they also lost control over their economies.\n\nKottayam was represented by Vira Varma, uncle of Pazhassi Raja during talks with the British in 1792. Vira Varma concluded a treaty with British by which he accepted all terms and conditions put forward by them.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Resistance to British rule&nbsp;\u2014 the Cotiote War==\n[[Image:PazhassiMemorial.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Pazhassi Kudeeram-a memorial for Pazhassi Raja at his burial spot in Mananthavadi, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], [[Kerala]], designed by Architect [[Eugene Pandala]]]]\n\nPazhassi Raja resisted British imperialism from 1793 onwards till his death in 1805.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He fought two wars to resist British intervention in the domestic affairs of his kingdom.

In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=16}} He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=38}} British had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept British suzerainty and hence they made obedient Vira Varma as head of Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=313}}\n\nVira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British. Moreover, the British assessment was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause. As seen before, Raja was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}\n\nIn 1793, Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British&nbsp;\u2013 as a mark of his protest.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma's dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=42}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=29}}\n\nIn 1793, Tipu's Vakils protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=36}}\n\nBut the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=43}} The Raja was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belongs to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja's kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=45}} The British also became angry that the Raja impaled two robbers as per customary law.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=314}} British planned to arrest Raja for 'murder', but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well armed Wayanad Nayars.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja's determination.

Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled ''Kannavath'' and ''Kannoth''], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people's support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle's conspiracies to undermine him.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja feared that British planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars.

Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nPlan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of British.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=19}} Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson's force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}\n\nAround this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar,{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}} who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut for time being, Raja was in a strong position.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}  On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=315}} They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}} and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nThe Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points:{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=64}}\n* Pazhassi Raja was to be 'pardoned'.\n* He will be returned his treasure.\n* He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.\n* He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.\n* Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam.\n\nA pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=72}}\n\nThus Raja's efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.\n\nTipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=20}}\n\n===Undeclared hostilities (1797-1800)===\n\nDespite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and English East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to subjugate Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=77}} Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of English directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad - all of which were deemed as \"injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam\" by Colonel Dow, English representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, English was powerless to put an end to his activities.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=73}}\n\n===Second revolt and death (1800\u20131805)===\n\nAfter the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=78}} But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country's ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans,{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu's death.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nBritish Government at Madras appointed Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara & Malabar.\n\nHe planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja's recruitment.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}\n\nRaja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General's absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader & his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar]] also joined Raja with their men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=84}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=66}}\n\nBy monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=89}} But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBy 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}} with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=180}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=90}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=316}} Raja became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of British, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} But the British were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja then visited his secret bases in Kottayam{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} and then moved into Kadathanad and into jungles of Kurumbranad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}}  British were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish them for their help to rebel Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=93}}\n\nAs a part of terrorisation, Peruvayal Nambiar who was arrested was hanged. British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=192}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=34}}\n\nFollowing murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=101}} and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}}\n\nAll these 'reforms' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to wall.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his 'reforms' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja's men were prepared for a rebellion.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Capture of Panamaram Fort====\n[[Image:Moat around Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|250px|Remains of the Moat surrounded the Panamaram British fort site.

Talakkal Chandu was executed somewhere near this tree.,Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\nThe first major event was the capture of [[Panamaram]] Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School).{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}\n\nWellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja's war.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}} 3000 men volunteered.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordmen, but some had muskets.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=104}}\n\nEdachena Kungan Nair led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBesides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But British could find rebels nowhere.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}\n\nThe rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  British were frustrated by Kottayam people's total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* & Payyormala*{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}} and people were sympathetic to rebels.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja's army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}} An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=107}}\n\nIn 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.<ref name=\"Panikker\">Historical preface of Kerala Simham, Sardar KM Panikker, [1941], DC Books, 2008 Edition, Kottayam 686,001</ref>\n\nIn 1803, British had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, British military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing British force to 13,000 men.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}}\n\nIn 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}} Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=35}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=112}} It was he who crushed Pazhassi's Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber&nbsp;\u2013 said to be just a 'civil servant.' Baber had both a personal motive&nbsp;\u2013 to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber's son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan.\n\nIn 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja's sympathiser] and Raja's men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=317}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=286}} If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSo once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=36}}\n\nBut monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=120}} Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja's war-effort had also succeeded.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-\u201c''We are not fighting 1000 men [Raja\u2019s army]&nbsp;... but one man&nbsp;... Kerala Varma''.\u201d-Raja's end would mean end of revolt.<ref name=\"Panikker\" />\n\n====Betrayal and death====\nT.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=121}}\n\nThere is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt.{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an \"adviser\" like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.\n\nIn light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja's hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.\n\nOn 1805, 30 November, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=123}} Raja's contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.\n\nThe precise nature of Raja's death is controversial. Folklore insists that he committed suicide by swallowing a diamond ring to avoid capture after he was wounded{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=15}} but Baber says he was killed by a clerk named Canara Menon.{{cn|date=April 2017}} W. J. Wilson, who wrote on the history of the Madras Regiment, credits Captain Clafam and his six sepoys for killing. This third version is more likely as Baber was not on good terms with military authority throughout the war. He is alleged to have credited Menon so as to deny credit to Clafam and his superior Colonel Hill.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}}\n\nKunjani, the wife of Raja who was taken the prisoner, committed suicide in captivity at Kappanaveedu, near Thalassery.

How he organized supplies for his several thousand strong armies remained a puzzle for them{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* To fight overwhelmingly superior enemies, Raja imparted military training to his peasantry wholesale and recruited them into his military force. This military policy of wholesale militarization was novel in the history of pre-modern Kerala.

Nobles, headmen, peasants, shopkeepers, merchants, artisans, and forest tribes rallied to fight the foreign invaders&nbsp;\u2014 first Mysore and later English East India Company.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* British losses were severe in terms of men and ran into several thousand. Death toll was particularly high with officers of commissioned ranks.

Raja allied with Company initially not because he was a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja included&nbsp;\u2013 allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=8}}\n\nSwaminatha Iyer, a British agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was on account of the fact that he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight British for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nAfter his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to British after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to fight English East India Company. But yet he refused to compromise. In a letter to Kalyat Kuttieman, he reveals his intent to resist English power to the end.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nHe took initiative to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\nRaja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad. He started a program that encouraged tribesmen in Wynad to adopt settled agriculture. As part of this program, he instructed his vassals in Wynad to distribute cattle and seeds to tribesmen in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\n==Supporters==\n\nPazhassi Raja was assisted by eighty chieftains during his wars and some were entrusted with administrative responsibilities also. Most prominent of them are Chengoteri Chathu, [[Pallur Eman]], Kaitheri Ambu, [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar|Kannavath Nambiar]], [[Thalakkal Chanthu|Thalakkal Chandu]] and [[Edachena Kunkan]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=103}}\n\n==Forest forts==\n\nIn his decades-long war to oust invaders, Rajah developed an elaborate system of cantonments and forts in the jungly and mountainous part of his country.\n\nFour of them are most important&nbsp;\u2013 granite fort on Purali range [modern Muzhakunnu] which was built by his ancestor Harischandra Perumal over a thousand years ago. He had another granite fort at Manatana. In Wynad, he had a great fort in Mananthavady which was reported to have ability to house his whole army of 6000 men. He also had a stronghold in Todikulam near Kannavam which belonged to his supporter Kannavath Sankaran.\n\nOf all his strongholds, none survive today. Only ruins of Purali fort survive today. It is today a heap of granite boulders. Only a tank still survives today.

He was a warrior Hindu prince and de facto head of the kingdom of [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]], otherwise known as Cotiote, in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], India, between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British [[East India Company]] is known as the [[Cotiote War]]. He is popularly known as '''''Kerala Simham''''' ('''''Lion of Kerala''''') on account of his martial exploits.\n\nPazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|occupied Malabar]] in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in [[Travancore]]. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the ''de facto'' heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects.\n\nIn 1792, after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. [[Vira Varma]], to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border.\n\n==Kingdom==\nPazhassi Raja was born in the Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar not [[Kottayam]] District in south Kerala. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of [[Mattannur]]. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British documents wrote ''Pazhassi Raja'' as ''Pychy Rajah'', while the name ''Cotiote Raja'' comes from the anglicizing of ''Kottayam'' to ''Cotiote''. Kottayam covers what is today the [[Thalassery]] taluk of the [[Kannur District]] and [[Wayanad district]], along with the [[Gudalur, Nilgiris|Gudalur]] taluk of [[Nilgiris district]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=24}}\n\nAs a royal clan, Purannattu Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wayanad \u2013 Its People and Traditions by C. Gopalan Nair</ref>\n\n==Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773\u20131793)==\nPazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was [[Hyder Ali]]. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of [[Tipu Sultan]], son and successor of Hyder Ali.\n\n===Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773\u20131782)===\nIn 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time,{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=295}} for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after war in 1768. Most of the ''Rajas'' of Malabar, along with many ''Naduvazhis'' or vassals fled to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organised resistances. The Malabari partisans made excellent use of the wooded hills that covered most of Malabar during this rebellion.\n\nIn 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali's troops, and stayed in Kottayam{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}} , where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=58}}\n\nOnce the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named [[Vira Varma]] and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.\n\nThe military situation was grim for ''Pazhassi Raja'' and his troops&nbsp;\u2013 in 1774, [[Kodagu|Coorgs]] had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal {{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=295}} and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=13}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=24}} This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nDuring his long war with the Mysore and then the English East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district&nbsp;\u2013 as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]] and [[Krishna Varma]], who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.\n\n====Siege of Thalasseri====\n[[Thalassery|Thalasseri]] or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the British naval situation on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the British in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military power at a regional basis.\n\nSo in 1778, Hyder's vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=296}} The British factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the [[Kottayam (Malabar)|Kottayam]] army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=27}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}}\n\nBy the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=296}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=14}} Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murland|first1=Lieutenant Colonel HF|title=Baillie-Ki-Paltan: A History of the 2nd Battalion, Madras Pioneers 1759 - 1930|date=2005|publisher=The Naval and Military Press Ltd|location=East Sussex|page=48}}</ref> Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja's help that enabled the British to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi&nbsp;\u2013 his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that his possessions in Malabar be restored.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}} This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja's troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}}\n\n===Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784\u20131793)===\nBy 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the British recognised [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=28}} The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Tiyar/Izhava) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.<ref>Calicut University Text for paper Kerala History and Culture Distance Education MA History 2007 by Prof. SS Warrier</ref>{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nWhat angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years&nbsp;\u2013 till 1793&nbsp;\u2013 when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja's hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter's policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission\u2014the extermination of the [[Nair]] caste from Kottayam to Palakkad&nbsp;\u2013 as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=29}}\n\nThe senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore's onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja's resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788:\n\n{{Quote|Between 1787 and 1788, the ''thampurans'' or Rajahs of Malabar, threatened by the forces of Tipu, fled to Travancore. Among them were the princes of Kottayathu.....The Senior Rajah before his flight summoned Kerala Varma, the youngest prince, and instructed him to protect the country. Accordingly, the latter assembled the inhabitants, retired to the jungles and assisted them in the development of a new homeland.  Frequently, in defiance to the authority of the Sultan, he with a band of determined followers issued forth from the woods and levied contributions.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=90}}}}\n\nBut in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 [[Nair]]s to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery).{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=31}} After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=32}} Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the British. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the British and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}}  The British then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This was where the British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land.<ref>Evolution of Kerala History and Culture, Prof. T.

From 1793\u20131797 he fought over the question of the management of Kottayam and from 1800\u20131805 over the issue of who was to be master of Wynad. British called their wars with Pazhassi Rajah as Cotiote War\n\n===First revolt (1793\u20131797)===\n\nPazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma, Raja of Kurumbranad. In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=16}} He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=38}} British had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept British suzerainty and hence they made obedient Vira Varma as head of Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=313}}\n\nVira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British. Moreover, the British assessment was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause. As seen before, Raja was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}\n\nIn 1793, Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British&nbsp;\u2013 as a mark of his protest.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=60}} He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}} Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma's dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=42}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=29}}\n\nIn 1793, Tipu's Vakils protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=36}}\n\nBut the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=91}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=61}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=43}} The Raja was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belongs to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja's kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=45}} The British also became angry that the Raja impaled two robbers as per customary law.{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=314}} British planned to arrest Raja for 'murder', but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well armed Wayanad Nayars.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja's determination. So British troops arrived in Kottayam to help Vira Varma's tax collectors, but Pazhassi Raja's men resisted them with success.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nIn 1796, orders were issued from Bombay to collect tax arrears for 2 years in Kottayam. For British no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja's fortified house at Pazhassi-but Raja fled four days earlier to Manattana (near Kottiyur). Gordon plundered the palace where traditional treasure of Raja was kept.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=30}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} Raja was angry at this loot and sent a letter to Supervisor at Thalassery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}}\n\nRaja was also angry that one of his former general named [[Pazhayamviden Chandu]] had become an agent of Kurumbranad Raja and what angered him even more than that was that this turn-coat had the audacity to boss him with Vira Varma's and British blessings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Raja shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja then blocked all British communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=48}} The British retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja and Low Malabar. But as they did not have enough troops to chase him they waited for reinforcements.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe British commandant was Colonel Dow, whom Raja knew well during Siege of Thalassery. So Raja thought that this old friend might help him mediate with the British government. Raja offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}} The Colonel and Raja being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed and so he forwarded Raja's request to Commissioners, who thought they were bitterly opposed to Raja's independent style, agreed to the Colonel's suggestion as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}}\n\nSo Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja's house [but not treasure], and the Raja's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja via Vira Varma&nbsp;\u2013 which meant that uncle Raja took care not to report to his nephew that the British had agreed to his requests. Uncle Raja had a vested interest in the war between the Company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=49}}\n\nVira Varma also removed [[Kaitheri Ambu]], a favourite noble and general of Raja, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled ''Kannavath'' and ''Kannoth''], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people's support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle's conspiracies to undermine him.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja feared that British planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma Raja was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja's main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule-a demand his uncle was not ready to accede.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish Commissioners' attitude also was arrogant-they were already prejudiced towards Raja and so were blind towards Raja's logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, Commissioners' issued a threat proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja does not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties would be confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to British-Kurumbranad rule became stronger.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma's troops had deserted to join ranks of resisters{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=92}} and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help British-after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and British for sake of pure self-interest.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja then visited Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=62}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=94}} and in 1797 held an audience with old enemy Tipu in Mysore who posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja in case of war and also to supply ammunition to rebels<ref name=\"WFrancis103\">{{cite book |last1=W.

He also began to collect troops and armament. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under Major General was sent by Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi. British also began to set up outposts in Kottayam and sent more troops to Wayanad.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}\n\nIn early 1797, Nayar militia rose all over Kottayam{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}} and British outposts were trapped in a true state of siege. Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. Same was the case in Wayanad where British troops that moved out of the safety of block-houses risked being way-laid by Kurichia bowmen. British suffered good loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}\n\n====Victory at Periya Pass====\n\nThis event was the most important in the whole war. In 1797, Colonel Dow & force marches into Wayanad. His plan was to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nReinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya they retreated to their original base.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=58}}\n\nDow's troops suffered chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles' regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in journey of Anderson-a delay that had fatal consequence for British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nDow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja as Tipu considered British entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad. He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja's men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=63}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=59}}\n\nThe day after he left, British force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}\n\nBut what they did not know was that Raja who learned of the true state of British army laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=314}}\n\nPlan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of British.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=19}} Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson's force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}\n\nAround this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar,{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}} who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut for time being, Raja was in a strong position.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=64}}  On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=315}} They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}} Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=32}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}} and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nThe Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points:{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=95}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=64}}\n* Pazhassi Raja was to be 'pardoned'.\n* He will be returned his treasure.\n* He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.\n* He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.\n* Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam.\n\nA pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=72}}\n\nThus Raja's efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.\n\nTipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=60}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=20}}\n\n===Undeclared hostilities (1797-1800)===\n\nDespite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and English East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to subjugate Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=77}} Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of English directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad - all of which were deemed as \"injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam\" by Colonel Dow, English representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, English was powerless to put an end to his activities.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=73}}\n\n===Second revolt and death (1800\u20131805)===\n\nAfter the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=78}} But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country's ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans,{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu's death.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}\n\nBritish Government at Madras appointed Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara & Malabar.\n\nHe planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=83}} Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja's recruitment.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}\n\nRaja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General's absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader & his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar]] also joined Raja with their men.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=84}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=66}}\n\nBy monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=315}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=175}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=85}} But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=89}} But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBy 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}} with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=180}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=90}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=316}} Raja became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of British, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nRaja had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} But the British were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja then visited his secret bases in Kottayam{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=187}} and then moved into Kadathanad and into jungles of Kurumbranad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=68}}  British were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish them for their help to rebel Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=93}}\n\nAs a part of terrorisation, Peruvayal Nambiar who was arrested was hanged. British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=192}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=34}}\n\nFollowing murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=101}} and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}}\n\nAll these 'reforms' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to wall.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his 'reforms' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja's men were prepared for a rebellion.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Capture of Panamaram Fort====\n[[Image:Moat around Panamaram fort site.JPG|thumb|250px|Remains of the Moat surrounded the Panamaram British fort site.

Talakkal Chandu was executed somewhere near this tree.,Panamaram, [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]], Kerala.]]\nThe first major event was the capture of [[Panamaram]] Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=103}} So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School).{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}\n\nWellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}} Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja's war.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=282}} 3000 men volunteered.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordmen, but some had muskets.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=104}}\n\nEdachena Kungan Nair led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBesides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But British could find rebels nowhere.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}\n\nThe rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}  British were frustrated by Kottayam people's total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* & Payyormala*{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}} and people were sympathetic to rebels.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja's army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri.{{sfnp|Menon|2007||p=316}}{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}} An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=106}} They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=21}} This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=283}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=107}}\n\nIn 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.<ref name=\"Panikker\">Historical preface of Kerala Simham, Sardar KM Panikker, [1941], DC Books, 2008 Edition, Kottayam 686,001</ref>\n\nIn 1803, British had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, British military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing British force to 13,000 men.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=70}}\n\nIn 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}} Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=35}}{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=112}} It was he who crushed Pazhassi's Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber&nbsp;\u2013 said to be just a 'civil servant.' Baber had both a personal motive&nbsp;\u2013 to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber's son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan.\n\nIn 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja's sympathiser] and Raja's men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=111}}{{sfnp|Menon|2007|p=317}}{{sfnp|Rajayyan|1971|p=286}} If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSo once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=36}}\n\nBut monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=120}} Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=119}} Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja's war-effort had also succeeded.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBritish for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-\u201c''We are not fighting 1000 men [Raja\u2019s army]&nbsp;... but one man&nbsp;... Kerala Varma''.\u201d-Raja's end would mean end of revolt.<ref name=\"Panikker\" />\n\n====Betrayal and death====\nT.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=121}}\n\nThere is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt.{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an \"adviser\" like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.\n\nIn light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja's hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.\n\nOn 1805, 30 November, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=}}{{Page needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBut evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it.{{sfnp|Kurup|2008|p=123}} Raja's contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.\n\nThe precise nature of Raja's death is controversial. Folklore insists that he committed suicide by swallowing a diamond ring to avoid capture after he was wounded{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=15}} but Baber says he was killed by a clerk named Canara Menon.{{cn|date=April 2017}} W. J. Wilson, who wrote on the history of the Madras Regiment, credits Captain Clafam and his six sepoys for killing. This third version is more likely as Baber was not on good terms with military authority throughout the war. He is alleged to have credited Menon so as to deny credit to Clafam and his superior Colonel Hill.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}}\n\nKunjani, the wife of Raja who was taken the prisoner, committed suicide in captivity at Kappanaveedu, near Thalassery. As reprisal on his family, property was confiscated and the palace at Pazhassi was demolished and replaced with a highway.{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=27}}{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=52}}{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}} The sorry state of his family aroused sympathy in local Thiyyas, who were loyal followers and built a new house for his family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elayavoor|first1=Vanidas|title=Vadakkan Aitihyamala|date=2002|publisher=Current Books|location=Kottayam|isbn=8124003963|page=108|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n\n{{Quote|...but in all classes, I observed a decided interest for the Pyche Raja, towards whom the inhabitants entertained regard and respect bordering on veneration, which not even his death can efface.|Thomas Harvey Baber, 1805{{sfnp|Ramachandran|2008|p=95}}}}\n* Descriptive account of Pazhassi Raja as early as 1775 confirm his later day image as a courageous warrior committed to the freedom of his country.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=9}}\n* Walter Ivor, a member of Court of Directors, who had taken part in negotiations with Pazhassi Raja in 1797 notes that British losses that year in Cotiote War exceeded British losses in Third Anglo-Mysore War.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}}\n* War waged by Pazhassi Raja was the longest anti-British resistance struggle in India{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=126}} and forest warfare waged by Raja had no parallel in the history of India in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century India.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* British military command always wondered at the logistics of Raja's army. How he organized supplies for his several thousand strong armies remained a puzzle for them{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* To fight overwhelmingly superior enemies, Raja imparted military training to his peasantry wholesale and recruited them into his military force. This military policy of wholesale militarization was novel in the history of pre-modern Kerala. His war-effort was marked by the participation of members of all creeds, classes, and castes who took up arms due to his inspiration. Nobles, headmen, peasants, shopkeepers, merchants, artisans, and forest tribes rallied to fight the foreign invaders&nbsp;\u2014 first Mysore and later English East India Company.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* British losses were severe in terms of men and ran into several thousand. Death toll was particularly high with officers of commissioned ranks. So high were the losses suffered by Bombay army regiments that operated in North Malabar that they had to be withdrawn in 1803 fearing that further losses would cripple Bombay Army as a respectable body of troops.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=127}}\n* Raja shared all the privations of his ordinary soldiers during the war and took part in all major military action exposing himself to personal danger. On account of these attributes, he commanded great respect of his troops.{{sfnp|Balakrishnan|2011|p=71}}\n* Royal regiments from Britain also took part in Cotiote War along with Company troops.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=128}} \n* Anti-British rebels in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also were allied to Pazhassi Raja.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=128}}\n* Arthur Wellesely, Duke of Wellington adopted methods of guerrilla warfare used by Pazhassi Raja to defeat Napoleon's armies in Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=A Sreedhara|title=Kerala History and its Makers|date=2016|publisher=DC Books|location=Kottayam|isbn=978-81-264-2199-2|page=174}}</ref>\n* Memory of Pazhassi Raja and his struggle inspired freedom struggle in 20th century Kerala.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=129}}\n\nPazhassi Raja had no selfish motive of personal power.

He believed that he was duty-bound to protect his subjects from exploitation and oppression.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}} Frenz (2008) also supports this view and opines that Raja was committed to the welfare of his people and freedom of his country. She notes that Pazhassi Raja opted for fight British when it became clear to him that English East India Company would not respect freedom of his country and welfare of his subjects. She noted that Raja considered it a personal failure as a leader if he failed to uphold sovereignty of his kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frenz|first1=Margaret|editor1-last=Fischer-Tine|editor1-first=Harald|editor2-last=Mann|editor2-first=Michael|title=Colonialism as Civilizing Mission: Cultural Ideology in British India|date=2004|publisher=Wimbledon Publishing Company|location=London|isbn=1843310929|page=64|chapter=A Race of Monsters: South India and British 'Civilizing Mission' in Later Eighteenth Century}}</ref>\n\nCriticism leveled against Raja for allying with English East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not rational in light of an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially not because he was a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar&nbsp;\u2013 Pazhassi Raja included&nbsp;\u2013 allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=8}}\n\nSwaminatha Iyer, a British agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was on account of the fact that he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight British for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nAfter his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to British after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to fight English East India Company. But yet he refused to compromise. In a letter to Kalyat Kuttieman, he reveals his intent to resist English power to the end.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=130}}\n\nHe took initiative to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\nRaja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad. He started a program that encouraged tribesmen in Wynad to adopt settled agriculture. As part of this program, he instructed his vassals in Wynad to distribute cattle and seeds to tribesmen in Wynad.{{sfnp|Kurup|1980|p=132}}\n\n==Supporters==\n\nPazhassi Raja was assisted by eighty chieftains during his wars and some were entrusted with administrative responsibilities also. Most prominent of them are Chengoteri Chathu, [[Pallur Eman]], Kaitheri Ambu, [[Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar|Kannavath Nambiar]], [[Thalakkal Chanthu|Thalakkal Chandu]] and [[Edachena Kunkan]].{{sfnp|Elayavoor|2007|p=103}}\n\n==Forest forts==\n\nIn his decades-long war to oust invaders, Rajah developed an elaborate system of cantonments and forts in the jungly and mountainous part of his country.\n\nFour of them are most important&nbsp;\u2013 granite fort on Purali range [modern Muzhakunnu] which was built by his ancestor Harischandra Perumal over a thousand years ago. He had another granite fort at Manatana. In Wynad, he had a great fort in Mananthavady which was reported to have ability to house his whole army of 6000 men. He also had a stronghold in Todikulam near Kannavam which belonged to his supporter Kannavath Sankaran.\n\nOf all his strongholds, none survive today. Only ruins of Purali fort survive today.

The [[Nord-Est (development region)|''Nord-Est'' Regional Development Agency]] is located in Piatra Neam\u021b.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe ''piatra'' [[toponym]] (meaning ''[[rock (geology)|rock]]'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) was always part of the settlement's name throughout its history. Other names that the city has been called are: '''Piatra lui Cr\u0103ciun''' (Christmas Rock, thus also corresponding to the Hungarian name of the city, \"Kar\u00e1cson-K\u0151\"); '''T\u00e2rgu Piatra''' (Rock Fair, Rock Market) (in the [[Middle Ages]]) or simply '''Piatra''' to which the county name '''[[Neam\u021b County|Neam\u021b]]''' was added.\n\n== Geography and access ==\n\nPiatra Neam\u021b lies in the [[Bistri\u021ba River (Siret)|Bistri\u021ba River]] Valley, surrounded by mountains - Pietricica (530 m), Cozla (679 m), Cernegura (852 m), B\u00e2tca Doamnei (462 m) and C\u00e2rloman (617 m), at an average height of {{convert|345|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\nThe city is located {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Bucharest]], in the historical region of [[Moldavia]]. The nearest airport is [[Bac\u0103u International Airport|Bac\u0103u]], situated {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=in}} south. Piatra Neam\u021b is linked by Romanian railway trunk number 509 to [[Bac\u0103u]] (therefore by 500 to Bucharest), and by DN15 national road to Bac\u0103u (therefore by [[DN2]] to Bucharest), Ia\u0219i, [[Suceava]], and [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]] ([[Transylvania]]).\n[[File:pnt map.svg|thumb|right|Map of Piatra Neam\u021b]]\n[[File:Piatra Neamt - Top Of Mt.

There are plans to build two new districts, the larger of which will be on the site of the former ''Reconstruc\u021bia'' factory.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Stephen's Tower in Piatra Neam\u0163, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Nativity of St. John the Baptist Church, Piatra Neam\u021b|Stephen's Tower]] built in 1499]]\nThe area around Piatra Neam\u021b is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Romania. The oldest traces of human civilisation in the present territory date back to the higher [[Paleolithic]], about 100,000 years BCE. The [[Cucuteni culture]], whose development lasted approximately one thousand years (ca. 3600-2600 BCE) was attested in the territory of Neam\u0163 county by a remarkable number of settlements (approx. 150), archaeological diggings unearthing important museum collections of [[Chalcolithic|Aeneolithic]] artifacts. Archaeologists have also discovered objects here dating back to the Neolithic Period and the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1900-1700 BCE).\n\nExcavations just outside the city revealed the ruins of a large [[Dacia]]n city, Petrodava, mentioned by Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. The whole compound had its heyday between the first century BCE and the first century CE. Standing out is the citadel at [[B\u00e2tca Doamnei]] which contains shrines resembling those identified in the [[Dacian Fortresses of the Orastie Mountains|Or\u0103\u0219tiei Mountains]]. As far as the existence of a local leader is concerned, historians tend to suggest the identification of the Kingdom of Dicomes in the very political centre at Petrodava. The complex of strongholds without peer in Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] is evidence as to a powerful political and military centre both in [[Burebista]]\u2019s time and in the period that preceded the reign of [[Decebalus]]. The settlement was documented in the 15th century as Piatra lui Craciun, or Camena, a [[market town]].\n\nThe first urban settlements, which emerged under [[Petru I of Moldova|Petru I Mu\u0219at]] (1375\u20131391), were Piatra lui Craciun, [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and Neam\u021b. The [[Neam\u021b citadel]], whose documentary attestation dates back to February 2, 1395, was also erected during the same consolidation period of the Moldovian principality east of the Carpathians. The Princely Court of Piatra Neam\u021b is mentioned for the first time in a document dated April 20, 1491, to have been founded between 1468 and 1475, under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], the Princely Cathedral being built in 1497-1498, and the {{convert|20|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall Bell Tower in 1499.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |18965\n|1930 |29827\n|1948 |26303\n|1956 |32648\n|1966 |45852\n|1977 |77812\n|1992 |123360\n|2002 |104914\n|2011 |85055\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Piatra Neam\u021b has a population of 85,055,<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{cite web | url = http://www.neamt.insse.ro/cmsneamt/rw/resource/date%20provizorii%20rpl%202011%20neamt.pdf | title = 2011 Census | date = February 2, 2012 | accessdate = March 12, 2012 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 24th [[List of cities and towns in Romania|largest city]] in Romania.\n\nAccording to the census from 2002, there were 104,914 people living within the city of Piatra Neam\u021b.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1&judet_id=253&localitate_id=254 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = January 2, 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> The ethnic makeup was as follows:\n\n* [[Romanians]]: 98.08%\n* [[Romani people|Roma]]: 1.3%\n* [[Lipovans]]: 0.16%\n* [[Hungarians]]: 0.14%\n* Other: 0.32%\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe city's industries include a fertilizer plant, a pulp and paper mill, and several food-processing plants.

Other names that the city has been called are: '''Piatra lui Cr\u0103ciun''' (Christmas Rock, thus also corresponding to the Hungarian name of the city, \"Kar\u00e1cson-K\u0151\"); '''T\u00e2rgu Piatra''' (Rock Fair, Rock Market) (in the [[Middle Ages]]) or simply '''Piatra''' to which the county name '''[[Neam\u021b County|Neam\u021b]]''' was added.\n\n== Geography and access ==\n\nPiatra Neam\u021b lies in the [[Bistri\u021ba River (Siret)|Bistri\u021ba River]] Valley, surrounded by mountains - Pietricica (530 m), Cozla (679 m), Cernegura (852 m), B\u00e2tca Doamnei (462 m) and C\u00e2rloman (617 m), at an average height of {{convert|345|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\nThe city is located {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Bucharest]], in the historical region of [[Moldavia]]. The nearest airport is [[Bac\u0103u International Airport|Bac\u0103u]], situated {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=in}} south. Piatra Neam\u021b is linked by Romanian railway trunk number 509 to [[Bac\u0103u]] (therefore by 500 to Bucharest), and by DN15 national road to Bac\u0103u (therefore by [[DN2]] to Bucharest), Ia\u0219i, [[Suceava]], and [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]] ([[Transylvania]]).\n[[File:pnt map.svg|thumb|right|Map of Piatra Neam\u021b]]\n[[File:Piatra Neamt - Top Of Mt.

There are plans to build two new districts, the larger of which will be on the site of the former ''Reconstruc\u021bia'' factory.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Stephen's Tower in Piatra Neam\u0163, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Nativity of St. John the Baptist Church, Piatra Neam\u021b|Stephen's Tower]] built in 1499]]\nThe area around Piatra Neam\u021b is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Romania. The oldest traces of human civilisation in the present territory date back to the higher [[Paleolithic]], about 100,000 years BCE. The [[Cucuteni culture]], whose development lasted approximately one thousand years (ca. 3600-2600 BCE) was attested in the territory of Neam\u0163 county by a remarkable number of settlements (approx. 150), archaeological diggings unearthing important museum collections of [[Chalcolithic|Aeneolithic]] artifacts. Archaeologists have also discovered objects here dating back to the Neolithic Period and the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1900-1700 BCE).\n\nExcavations just outside the city revealed the ruins of a large [[Dacia]]n city, Petrodava, mentioned by Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. The whole compound had its heyday between the first century BCE and the first century CE. Standing out is the citadel at [[B\u00e2tca Doamnei]] which contains shrines resembling those identified in the [[Dacian Fortresses of the Orastie Mountains|Or\u0103\u0219tiei Mountains]]. As far as the existence of a local leader is concerned, historians tend to suggest the identification of the Kingdom of Dicomes in the very political centre at Petrodava. The complex of strongholds without peer in Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] is evidence as to a powerful political and military centre both in [[Burebista]]\u2019s time and in the period that preceded the reign of [[Decebalus]].

The [[Neam\u021b citadel]], whose documentary attestation dates back to February 2, 1395, was also erected during the same consolidation period of the Moldovian principality east of the Carpathians. The Princely Court of Piatra Neam\u021b is mentioned for the first time in a document dated April 20, 1491, to have been founded between 1468 and 1475, under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], the Princely Cathedral being built in 1497-1498, and the {{convert|20|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall Bell Tower in 1499.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |18965\n|1930 |29827\n|1948 |26303\n|1956 |32648\n|1966 |45852\n|1977 |77812\n|1992 |123360\n|2002 |104914\n|2011 |85055\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Piatra Neam\u021b has a population of 85,055,<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{cite web | url = http://www.neamt.insse.ro/cmsneamt/rw/resource/date%20provizorii%20rpl%202011%20neamt.pdf | title = 2011 Census | date = February 2, 2012 | accessdate = March 12, 2012 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 24th [[List of cities and towns in Romania|largest city]] in Romania.\n\nAccording to the census from 2002, there were 104,914 people living within the city of Piatra Neam\u021b.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1&judet_id=253&localitate_id=254 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = January 2, 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> The ethnic makeup was as follows:\n\n* [[Romanians]]: 98.08%\n* [[Romani people|Roma]]: 1.3%\n* [[Lipovans]]: 0.16%\n* [[Hungarians]]: 0.14%\n* Other: 0.32%\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe city's industries include a fertilizer plant, a pulp and paper mill, and several food-processing plants.

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging. Use of the term \"market\" instead of \"country\" usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries' [[capital market]]s as opposed to the overall economy.\n\n* [[Developed country|Developed countries]] and [[developed market]]s\n* Developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market:\n** [[Newly industrialized country|Newly industrialized countries]]<ref name=\"Globalization\">{{cite book|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy | first = Pawe\u0142 | last = Bo\u017cyk | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7546-4638-9|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries}}</ref><ref name=\"Limits\">{{cite book|title=The Limits of Convergence| first = Mauro F. | last = Guill\u00e9n | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-691-11633-4|chapter=Multinationals, Ideology, and Organized Labor|author-link=Mauro F.

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging. Use of the term \"market\" instead of \"country\" usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries' [[capital market]]s as opposed to the overall economy.\n\n* [[Developed country|Developed countries]] and [[developed market]]s\n* Developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market:\n** [[Newly industrialized country|Newly industrialized countries]]<ref name=\"Globalization\">{{cite book|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy | first = Pawe\u0142 | last = Bo\u017cyk | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7546-4638-9|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries}}</ref><ref name=\"Limits\">{{cite book|title=The Limits of Convergence| first = Mauro F. | last = Guill\u00e9n | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-691-11633-4|chapter=Multinationals, Ideology, and Organized Labor|author-link=Mauro F.

The campus is located close to the banks of the river [[Periyar River|Periyar]], in Aluva city.\n\nUnion Christian College is the only centre of higher education in Kerala functioning on an ecumenical basis. The college is managed by an association of members drawn from the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church the Malankara Orthodox syrian Church, the [[Church of South India]] and the Inter Church Fellowship of the College.\n\nIt became a congregating centre for a host of scholars, theologians and missionaries from the west. The list includes Canon W. E. S. Holland, Rev. L. W. Hooper, Rev. B. G. Crowley and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The faculty of the early years was a balanced mix of Christian and non-Christian members. The college has maintained this secular structure to the present.\n\n===An A grade college===\nUnion Christian College received A grade from the National Assessment. UCC is the first college getting accredited in the third cycle (for the period of 2011\u201316 ).

Buddha exhorts : \u2018Hold to the truth within yourselves as to the only lamp\u2019. The [[Quran]] declaror that \u2018God is truth\u2019. To Gandhiji, the father of the nation, the whole of life was the pursuit of or experiments with truth. His MahaganithamrMahaganithamworld, although in a limited field, that the way of truth leads to freedom.\n\n==  Mahaganitham ==\n\u2018Mahaganitham\u2019  is a sculpture commemorating the large mahogany tree that stood in front of the Kacherry Malika. The tree was struck by lightning in 2002 and the remnants stand as \u2018Mahaganitham\u2019 near its original position.\nthe\n\u2018Mahaganitham\u2019 represents the historic Mahogany tree and \u2018Ganitham\u2019, [[Mathematics]], the queen of all sciences.  Concepts like the Golden ratio and Fibonacci series are used in the design. More than a thousand mathematical entities and geometrical shapes are engraved in the sculpture. The five [[Platonism|Platonic]] bodies - tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron -  are present in it. An iron bell, used during the early period of the college, is a part of the sculpture.\n\n==Kachery Malika==\n[[File:Kacheri Malika at UC College, Aluva, Kerala, India IMG 20180821 173303.jpg|thumb|Kacheri Malika at UC College, Aluva, Kerala, India]]\nKachery Malika is a three storey building in the campus. This building housed the Zilla court of [[Travancore]] state in 19th Century. The architecture of kacheri malika is a blend of Dutch, British and Indian styles. It is a typical administrative building in Travancore. \n\nThis Kachery (Means Court) is one of the five kacheries in AD 1811 during the reign of [[Gowri Lakshmi Bayi|Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bhai]]. \n\nThis building is built up on a small hill called Kachery kunnu and the access to this hill is only through ferry. The jetty was called Kachery Kadavu. Today the [[Aluva]]- [[North Paravur|Paravur]] road is passing in front of this building.\n\nThe structure, flooring, wood work of this building are kept intact. In 1993, [[Government of Kerala]] declared Kacheri Malika as a protected monument. \n\nIn AD 1800 this building was a European bungalow later in AD 1811-1896 it was functioned as a court. From AD 1897 to 1920 it was not used and abandoned and later in AD 1921 Union christian college starts functioning in this building.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|people|date=April 2018}}\n* [[Philipose Mar Chrysostom]] Valiya Metropolitan\n* [[Paravoor T.

The campus is located close to the banks of the river [[Periyar River|Periyar]], in Aluva city.\n\nUnion Christian College is the only centre of higher education in Kerala functioning on an ecumenical basis. The college is managed by an association of members drawn from the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church the Malankara Orthodox syrian Church, the [[Church of South India]] and the Inter Church Fellowship of the College.\n\nIt became a congregating centre for a host of scholars, theologians and missionaries from the west. The list includes Canon W. E. S. Holland, Rev. L. W. Hooper, Rev. B. G. Crowley and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The faculty of the early years was a balanced mix of Christian and non-Christian members. The college has maintained this secular structure to the present.\n\n===An A grade college===\nUnion Christian College received A grade from the National Assessment. UCC is the first college getting accredited in the third cycle (for the period of 2011\u201316 ). The NAAC team visited the campus on 16, 17 and 18 March 2011.\n\n==Features==\nThe founder members of the College had as their ambition the instituting of [[Inter-denominational]] whose distinctive features were to be:\n\n\n\n* [[Inter-denominational]] basis of administration\n* Residential and day scholar system of life\n* Fellowship method of life\n* [[multicultural|Cosmopolitan]] team (Christians and non-Christian, Indians and non-Indians) of staff.\n\nThe college, at first entirely residential, has now on its rolls a larger number of day scholars than residents.\n\n==Mahatma Gandhi's visit==\nIn visitors Mahatma Gandhi visited the college and planted a mango tree. He wrote in the visitors book '''''delighted with the ideal situation'''''. The mango sapling is now flourishing in front of the administrative block\n[[File:\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d38\u0d3f \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d33\u0d47\u0d1c\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d \u0d17\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d27\u0d3f\u0d1c\u0d3f \u0d28\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d.JPG|thumb|The tree planted by Gandhi in 1925]]\n\n==Motto and emblem==\n\n===Emblem===\nThe present emblem was adopted in 1939. The symbolism calls on the seekers after knowledge and truth to hold the tor'''''.'''''h, read the book and reap the harvest.\n\n=== Motto ===\nThe college motto is '''''The Truth shall make you free.'''''\nThis motto is drawn from a statement made by [[Jesus]] to the Jews: \"You will know the truth and the truth  :ll make you free\".\n\nThe [[Rigveda]] proclaims that \u2018Truth is the support of the earth\u2019. Buddha exhorts : \u2018Hold to the truth within yourselves as to the only lamp\u2019. The [[Quran]] declaror that \u2018God is truth\u2019. To Gandhiji, the father of the nation, the whole of life was the pursuit of or experiments with truth. His MahaganithamrMahaganithamworld, although in a limited field, that the way of truth leads to freedom.\n\n==  Mahaganitham ==\n\u2018Mahaganitham\u2019  is a sculpture commemorating the large mahogany tree that stood in front of the Kacherry Malika. The tree was struck by lightning in 2002 and the remnants stand as \u2018Mahaganitham\u2019 near its original position.\nthe\n\u2018Mahaganitham\u2019 represents the historic Mahogany tree and \u2018Ganitham\u2019, [[Mathematics]], the queen of all sciences.  Concepts like the Golden ratio and Fibonacci series are used in the design. More than a thousand mathematical entities and geometrical shapes are engraved in the sculpture. The five [[Platonism|Platonic]] bodies - tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron -  are present in it. An iron bell, used during the early period of the college, is a part of the sculpture.\n\n==Kachery Malika==\n[[File:Kacheri Malika at UC College, Aluva, Kerala, India IMG 20180821 173303.jpg|thumb|Kacheri Malika at UC College, Aluva, Kerala, India]]\nKachery Malika is a three storey building in the campus. This building housed the Zilla court of [[Travancore]] state in 19th Century. The architecture of kacheri malika is a blend of Dutch, British and Indian styles. It is a typical administrative building in Travancore. \n\nThis Kachery (Means Court) is one of the five kacheries in AD 1811 during the reign of [[Gowri Lakshmi Bayi|Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bhai]]. \n\nThis building is built up on a small hill called Kachery kunnu and the access to this hill is only through ferry. The jetty was called Kachery Kadavu. Today the [[Aluva]]- [[North Paravur|Paravur]] road is passing in front of this building.\n\nThe structure, flooring, wood work of this building are kept intact. In 1993, [[Government of Kerala]] declared Kacheri Malika as a protected monument. \n\nIn AD 1800 this building was a European bungalow later in AD 1811-1896 it was functioned as a court. From AD 1897 to 1920 it was not used and abandoned and later in AD 1921 Union christian college starts functioning in this building.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|people|date=April 2018}}\n* [[Philipose Mar Chrysostom]] Valiya Metropolitan\n* [[Paravoor T.

Achim Holub promises to give conductors: 60-90 minutes of podium time with an orchestra, including 1-2 concert performances, personalized multi-angle videos, and a professional sound recording. Participants will not get anything of this. The maximum conductors can get 20 minutes of podium time, 1-2 concerts without audience and posters, and one camera video with bad quality. There are times that Achim Holub does not send the videos at all and conductors are left without videos. Achim Holub also promises to give recommendations for promoting a career.  He recommends the book 'Be Your Own Agent' by Bernhard Kerres and nothing else. Many participants think that this masterclass is also a competition. There is no competition and there is no orchestra voting. Achim Holub imitates the voting and he himself fills out all the voting sheets.\n\n== Controversy ==\nAt a recent Conducting Masterclass session in London the police were called in to investigate his financial activities after complaints from the orchestra members.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the Styrian capital of [[Graz]], his first musical experiences came at an early age through his mother's, Sofia Holub's, Jazz band. His father [[Ignaz Eduard Holub]] was a highly successful, internationally active architect who had close family relations to the famous American writer [[Arthur Miller]] (Achim Holub's half-sister Doris stayed for one year with the Miller's at their home in New York State during the 1960s.)\n\nHe received his first piano tuition at the age of six, and decided, after initially being extremely attached to Jazz, to become a professional conductor at the age of twelve. With fourteen he became a student of [[Alois. J. Hochstrasser]], the then music director of the [[Graz Symphony Orchestra]], at the [[Johann-Joseph-Fux-Konservatorium des Landes Steiermark]].\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1984 he became a student of [[Milan Horvat]] at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz|University of Music and Performing Arts]] in Graz. Among his other teachers were [[Andrzej Dobrowolski]] and [[Georg Friedrich Haas]] (Music Theory), as well as [[Wolfgang Bozic]] (Opera).\n\nHe then continued his education with [[Michael Gielen]] at [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum University Salzburg]] Summer Academy, [[Ferdinand Leitner]] at [[Accademia Musicale Chigiana]] Siena and [[Hiroyuki Iwaki]] and [[Edo de Waart]] at the [[Netherlands Symphony Orchestra]] International Conducting Masterclass in Hilversum and Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1991 [[John Eliot Gardiner|Sir John Eliot Gardiner]] offered him, after a selection process which involved 60 conductors conducting the [[English Baroque Soloists]] at auditions in Stuttgart and Berlin, active participation at his conducting masterclass featuring operas by Mozart at the

His former best friend, Prince Laval of the Lion Tribe, becomes his worst enemy. Thus, a terrible war breaks out between the eight animal tribes over the powerful Chi, a substance that can both sustain life and destroy it. Before the final battle a black cloud stops the Chi falls making Cragger blame Laval for it. At the final battle, since Crooler has run out of Persuader Plants and Laval fakes his death, Cragger is emotionally moved and apologizes for everything he has done. It is revealed that  Laval faked his death  to find the Crocodile legend beast, along with Cragger's mother.\n\n===Season 2===\nWhen the Crawlers use the advantages of the war for the Chi to steal the Chi from Mount Cavora, the eight heroes of Chima must travel to the Outlands to rescue the eight Legend Beasts, which are the keys to restarting Mount Cavora.

The heroes eventually find all 9 and spark another Great Illumination. Because of this, everything is fixed. The lands are no longer covered in ice and even the Hunter Tribes were healed of their rotting flesh as well as the corruption in their hearts.

The Crawlers were soon frozen by the spreading ice produced by the Ice Hunters, but were soon melted out of the ice by Flinx and later ejected from the glaciers.\n\n====The Scorpion Tribe====\nThe '''[[Scorpion]] Tribe''' appears to be the leading tribe of the Crawlers. They have some sort of venom in their tails which allows them to control minds which they once used it to control the Raven and Wolf Legend Beast.

Individual Bats have not been shown speaking clearly. However, the Chima Online shorts reveal that the Bats who make up the Black Cloud can communicate in a single understandable voice.

Whether this indicates that Bats can communicate in the same tongue as the other Tribes or have their own language that Scorm can understand is unknown.\n\n* '''Braptor''' - Braptor is the King of the Bat Tribe.

Their Phoenix Temple is located on Mount Cavora, and has been since ancient times when Cavora was an ordinary mountain. Anciently, the Phoenix took it upon themselves to educate the other tribes and aid them in their advancement. However, Sir Fangar of the Saber-Tooth Tiger Tribe became corrupted by his new knowledge and led his own tribe, the Mammoth Tribe and the Vulture Tribe in a war against the rest of Chima. In order to stop them, the Phoenix used eight ancient artifacts to produce the \"Illumination\" which reverted Chima to a primordial state and trapped the Ice Hunters in the Gorge of Eternal Depth in ice. Mount Cavora was lifted into the sky and surrounded by an energy field, which isolated the Phoenix Tribe from the new \"Earthborn\" tribes below. It also began absorbing moisture from the air and producing the Chi falls that fell to the surface.

It began with 2 episodes airing on January 16, 2013, with the Season 1 finale on December 5, 2013.\n\nOn March 15, 2014, season 2 premiered on Cartoon Network and ended on November 22, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nChima is a pristine [[realm]] filled with [[tribe]]s consisting of various [[anthropomorphic animals]] ranging from the [[Lion]]s, [[Crocodile]]s, [[Eagle]]s, [[Gorilla]]s, [[Gray wolf|Wolves]], [[Raven]]s, [[Rhinoceros|Rhinos]], [[Bear]]s, [[Beaver]]s, [[Scorpion]]s, [[Spider]]s, [[Bat]]s, [[Smilodon|Saber-Tooth Tigers]], [[Mammoth]]s, [[Vulture]]s, [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenixes]], [[Tiger]]s, [[Leopard]]s, [[Polar bear|Ice Bear]]s, and other animals.\n\n===Season 1===\nWhen young Prince Cragger loses his parents in the Gorge of Eternal Depth and becomes king of the Crocodile Tribe, his sister Crooler uses Persuader Plants to force him to do whatever she wants (mostly destroy the Lions). His former best friend, Prince Laval of the Lion Tribe, becomes his worst enemy. Thus, a terrible war breaks out between the eight animal tribes over the powerful Chi, a substance that can both sustain life and destroy it. Before the final battle a black cloud stops the Chi falls making Cragger blame Laval for it. At the final battle, since Crooler has run out of Persuader Plants and Laval fakes his death, Cragger is emotionally moved and apologizes for everything he has done. It is revealed that  Laval faked his death  to find the Crocodile legend beast, along with Cragger's mother.\n\n===Season 2===\nWhen the Crawlers use the advantages of the war for the Chi to steal the Chi from Mount Cavora, the eight heroes of Chima must travel to the Outlands to rescue the eight Legend Beasts, which are the keys to restarting Mount Cavora. After the defeat of the Crawlers, Chima becomes a peaceful land, but not for long.\n\n===Season 3===\nAs a threat of the Ancient Hunter Tribes emerge, the heroes of Chima must find the legendary Fire tribes and unlock the new Fire CHI power to turn up the heat and stop the Ice tribes from freezing all of Chima. Towards the end of the battles with the Hunter Tribes, the heroes begin their quest for the 8 (technically 9) Fire Wings, the only things powerful enough to stop the Hunter Tribes. The heroes eventually find all 9 and spark another Great Illumination. Because of this, everything is fixed. The lands are no longer covered in ice and even the Hunter Tribes were healed of their rotting flesh as well as the corruption in their hearts. Chima, once again, becomes a peaceful land with the threat from other dangerous species. The final scene of episode 41 reveals that Chima is a [[realm]] of a giant floating continent hovering above on an even larger unknown world.\n\n==Characters==\n===The Lion Tribe===\nThe '''[[Lion]] Tribe''' resides in the Lion [[Temple]] (referred to as the \"Lion City\" in most episodes) at the base of Mount Cavora where they harvest and equally distribute the Chi to all the Animal Tribes.

The Crawlers were soon frozen by the spreading ice produced by the Ice Hunters, but were soon melted out of the ice by Flinx and later ejected from the glaciers.\n\n====The Scorpion Tribe====\nThe '''[[Scorpion]] Tribe''' appears to be the leading tribe of the Crawlers. They have some sort of venom in their tails which allows them to control minds which they once used it to control the Raven and Wolf Legend Beast. Razar described the venom of the Scorpion Tribe to be similar to a Persuader Plant. The Scorpions believe the \"Great Scorpion\" dropped Chi Orbs from the sky (even though it was Laval).

They were called the \"Black Cloud\" when this happened as they can split into many bats. They appear very little as regular bats and have a minor role with little authority in the Crawlers. Individual Bats have not been shown speaking clearly. However, the Chima Online shorts reveal that the Bats who make up the Black Cloud can communicate in a single understandable voice. Scorm was also shown listening to a whispered report from a Bat soldier. Whether this indicates that Bats can communicate in the same tongue as the other Tribes or have their own language that Scorm can understand is unknown.\n\n* '''Braptor''' - Braptor is the King of the Bat Tribe.

Like the Scorpions, they originally believed that a great creature was responsible for providing them with Chi that led to their evolution which was actually Laval. However, they believe in a Great Spider rather than a Scorpion even though it was a Lion.\n\n* '''Spinlyn''' - Spinlyn is the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] of the Spider Tribe who has an appearance that is similar to a [[drider]].\n* '''Sparacon''' - Sparacon is the Chief Spider Soldier who has six legs.\n* '''Sparratus''' - Sparratus is the suspected Prince of the Spider Tribe.\n* '''Spindle''' - Spindle is a Spider soldier.\n* '''Spider Soldiers''' - They are the Spider Tribe's soldiers with 8 arms.\n\n===The Ice Hunter Tribes===\nThe '''Ice Tribes''' are a group of tribes that specialize in ice attacks. As a result of them using Ice Powers and being frozen in the Gorge of Eternal Depth of Ice upon being defeated by the Phoenix Tribe, each of the Ice Hunters lost their flesh (the parts where they lost some flesh is represented by the purple on their bodies) and gained exposed bones (which are shown through their blue transparent parts). The Ice Tribes want to freeze all of Chima so that they can live in cold temperatures. At the end of \"The Heart of Cavora,\" the Ice Hunters are purified by the Illumination which restored their lost flesh and got rid of their exposed bones.\n\n====The Saber-Toothed Tiger Tribe====\nThe '''[[Smilodon|Saber-Tooth Tiger]] Tribe''' is the leading tribe of the Ice Hunters.\n\n* '''[[Sir]] Fangar''' - Sir Fangar is the cold-hearted leader of the Saber-Tooth Tiger Tribe who has a transparent left arm and a transparent right leg, and the main antagonist of Season Three.\n* '''Stealthor''' - Stealthor is the General and suspected Prince of the Saber-Tooth Tiger Tribe.

She is the mother of Mungus and Mottrot.\n* '''Mungus''' - Mungus is the Prince of the Mammoth Tribe with an icy trunk and transparent ribs. Mungus is the younger brother of Mottrot and son of Maula.

The members of the Fire Tribe specialize in the use of Fire Chi.\n\n====The Phoenix Tribe====\nThe '''[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] Tribe''' is the leading tribe of the Fire Tribes, and the oldest and most advanced tribe in Chima. Their Phoenix Temple is located on Mount Cavora, and has been since ancient times when Cavora was an ordinary mountain. Anciently, the Phoenix took it upon themselves to educate the other tribes and aid them in their advancement. However, Sir Fangar of the Saber-Tooth Tiger Tribe became corrupted by his new knowledge and led his own tribe, the Mammoth Tribe and the Vulture Tribe in a war against the rest of Chima. In order to stop them, the Phoenix used eight ancient artifacts to produce the \"Illumination\" which reverted Chima to a primordial state and trapped the Ice Hunters in the Gorge of Eternal Depth in ice. Mount Cavora was lifted into the sky and surrounded by an energy field, which isolated the Phoenix Tribe from the new \"Earthborn\" tribes below. It also began absorbing moisture from the air and producing the Chi falls that fell to the surface. The Phoenix Tribe carved the mouths of the falls into shapes resembling the eight new major tribes and their Legend Beasts. The Phoenix Tribe remained separate from Chima and its affairs....until the Ice Hunters escaped from their icy imprisonment.\n\n* '''Fluminox''' - Fluminox is the 10,000-year-old King of the Phoenix Tribe.\n* '''Flinx''' - Flinx is the young Prince of the Phoenix Tribe and Fluminox's son.\n* '''Foltrax''' - Foltrax is a member of the Phoenix Tribe and is the captain of the Blazing Bastion.\n* '''Frax''' - Frax is an orange-feathered member of the Phoenix Tribe.\n* '''Firox''' - Firox is an orange-feathered member of the Phoenix Tribe with aviator goggles.\n\n====The Tiger Tribe====\nThe '''[[Tiger]] Tribe''' are the militaristic members of the Fire Tribes.

Tormak is a noble adviser to Fluminox, and convinces him to give the Earthborn tribes of Chima a chance to prove themselves worthy of Fire Chi. After the Phoenix Map exploded, Tormak was burned badly by its energies which he absorbed which caused him to take on a [[Black tiger (animal)|black tiger]] appearance and be mistaken for a [[Black panther|Panther]] by some characters. A symbol is on one top of his head. He was later restored to normal by the Illumination that also purified the Ice Hunter Tribes.\n* '''Tazar''' - Tazar is a Tiger Cat Guide and one of the guards as seen in Episode 31.\n* '''Trakkar''' - Trakkar is a Tiger Cat Guide.

He is a [[historian]] that keeps track of all events that have occurred in Chima and thinks that there are more leopards somewhere in the world.\n\n===Legend Beasts===\nThe '''Legend Beasts''' are a group of animals that did not drink the Chi from Mount Cavora and have left Chima in where they were prophesied to return there when they are needed the most.

He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[The Lost Thing]]'', a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include ''[[The Red Tree (Shaun Tan)|The Red Tree]]'' and ''[[The Arrival (graphic novel)|The Arrival]]''.\n\nTan was born in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless [[graphic novel]] ''The Arrival'' won the Book of the Year prize as part of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/2007-nsw-premiers-literary-awards/2007/05/29/1180205249745.html | title = 2007 NSW Premier's Literary Awards | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref> The same book won the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|Picture Book of the Year]] award in 2007.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://cbc.org.au/winner07.htm | publisher = CBCA | title = Book of the Year Awards | contribution = Winners 2007}}.</ref> and the [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]] Premier's Prize in 2006.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/hall_of_fame/shaun_tan | title = Premier's Book Awards Hall of Fame | publisher = [[State Library of Western Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\nTan's work has been described as an \"Australian vernacular\" that is \"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, [[Street children|guttersnipe]] and [[sprezzatura]].

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work.

He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[The Lost Thing]]'', a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include ''[[The Red Tree (Shaun Tan)|The Red Tree]]'' and ''[[The Arrival (graphic novel)|The Arrival]]''.\n\nTan was born in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless [[graphic novel]] ''The Arrival'' won the Book of the Year prize as part of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/2007-nsw-premiers-literary-awards/2007/05/29/1180205249745.html | title = 2007 NSW Premier's Literary Awards | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref> The same book won the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|Picture Book of the Year]] award in 2007.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://cbc.org.au/winner07.htm | publisher = CBCA | title = Book of the Year Awards | contribution = Winners 2007}}.</ref> and the [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]] Premier's Prize in 2006.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/hall_of_fame/shaun_tan | title = Premier's Book Awards Hall of Fame | publisher = [[State Library of Western Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\nTan's work has been described as an \"Australian vernacular\" that is \"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, [[Street children|guttersnipe]] and [[sprezzatura]].

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: \"I\u2019m pretty omnivorous when it comes to influences, and I like to admit this openly.\"<ref name = \"locusmag\" /> Some influences are very direct.

In both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] he played a key role in combined Dutch-British intelligence operations.\n\n==Early career==\nHe was born in 1883 in the naval town of [[Den Helder]] as the eight child of Laurens van 't Sant and N\u00e9line Fran\u00e7ois. His father was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. His youth was mostly spend in the city of [[Utrecht]]. In 1906 he became a clerk within the [[Rotterdam]] Municipal Police Corps, a starters function for future police officers. He impressed his superiors so much that after an unusual short period of six months he was promoted inspector trainee. He served in Rotterdam's roughest neighbourhood, Rodezand, where sailors from all over the world would meet prostitutes. In 1910 he was promoted to inspector 3rd class and head of the River Police unit. On 27 August 1914 he married the Swedish [[soprano]] Kerstin (Greta) Margaretha Jonsson, after he had met her at a Wagner performance in Rotterdam during an international tour. In June 1915 the couple had a daughter.\n\n==World War I==\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]] Van 't Sant was tasked with controlling foreign [[secret agent]]s operating in [[Rotterdam]]. He also became an officer in the Dutch military intelligence and security service [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|GSIII]]. Because of its location and Dutch [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] the international port city become the war's largest spy centre. At an early stage Van 't Sant met [[Richard B. Tinsley|Richard Tinsley]], a maritime agent turned station chief of the British secret service now known as the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] or MI6. Between him and Tinsley a co-operation developed where the Rotterdam police would tolerate British intelligence operations directed against [[Germany]] in return for sharing the gathered intelligence. Van 't Sant attempted to establish a similar arrangement with the German secret services operating in Rotterdam, but no arrangement could be reached as the German services did not trust him.\n\nThanks to his ability to control foreign secret services and his dealings with Tinsley, at the age of 33 Inspector Van 't Sant was promoted to [[commissioner|head-commissioner]] (Chief of Police) of the city of Utrecht in November 1916. In 1918 the Germans approached him to establish contacts with the British government to begin the peace negotiations which brought the war to an end. Van 't Sant was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] by [[King George V]] in January 1920, a rare honour for non-British citizens.{{sfn|Ruis|2016|p= }}\n\n==Prince Henry==\nIn October 1920 Van 't Sant became head-commissioner of [[The Hague]], a more prestigious post than Utrecht, as it involved regular contacts with the Royal House and key government figures. Queen Wilhelmina employed Van 't Sant as her odd-job man. One of his main tasks would be to keep Prince-consort [[Prince Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], out of trouble. Next to his only legitimate daughter [[Princess Juliana of the Netherlands]], the future queen, Prince Henry had fathered several illegitimate children for which Van 't Sant had to make regular payments. Henry's philandering life style also involved regular visits to prostitutes. With knowledge of the queen, Van 't Sant invited prostitutes to his private home in The Hague in order to better control them and assess their health, before Prince Henry would enter through the back door and spend some time with them in Van 't Sant's guest room.{{sfn|Arlman & Mulder|1983|pp=57-58}}\n\nIn the 1930s Van 't Sant would become entangled in the 'Elisabeth le Roi Affair'. This affair was centred around a possible mistress of Prince Henry named Elisabeth le Roi, very likely a [[pseudonym]]. Van 't Sant pretended that her illegitimate child was fathered by the recently deceased [[Jonkheer]] Carel van Vredenburch, a former high ranking, rich and upper class Dutch diplomat. Van 't Sant convinced Vredenburch's heirs that the child was Vredenburch's and in order to avoid public embarrassment he had to pay the woman [[hush money]] and make her and her child disappear. But soon Vredenburch's family started to suspect Van 't Sant was swindling them as part of an ordinary blackmail scheme. An unofficial investigation and informal tribunal by three selected members of the ruling class followed. The tribunal acquitted Van 't Sant, but did reproach him for unprofessional behaviour. In January 1935 he resigned voluntarily as head-commissioner of police.{{sfn|Zee|2015|p=126}}\n\nQueen Wilhelmina intermittently employed Van 't Sant as her private secretary. When the story of the secret tribunal broke via the [[National socialism|National Socialist]] newspaper ''[[Volk en Vaderland]]'', public outcry forced the authorities to an official criminal investigation. It lasted until 1938 when Van 't Sant was again acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In 1956 Van 't Sant admitted in an interview with historian [[Loe de Jong]] that he had scammed the Vredenburch family and had made up the story in order to spare the Royals another scandal. Still, some people did not accept his explanation. Especially the Dutch writer and journalist [[A. den Doolaard]] would remain his adversary, publishing in as late as 1980 a pamphlet against Van 't Sant.\n\n==World War II==\n [[File:Fran\u00e7oisvantSant.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant on Pall Mall near St. James's Palace, London, 1946.]]\nWhen the Germans invaded the Netherlands on Friday 10 May 1940 the Queen and the Royal Family were in danger of capture by the Nazis. On Sunday 12 May the Queen, accompanied by Van 't Sant, travelled to [[Hook of Holland]] and at 23.00 in the evening left the Netherlands on board of the British destroyer [[HMS Codrington]].{{sfn|Zee|2015|p=161}} Van 't Sant had to leave his wife and daughter behind. His house in The Hague was confiscated by the [[Sicherheitsdienst Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|''Sicherheitsdienst'']] (SD), the security service of the SS, who used it as an office and its cellar as a torture chamber. In the exiled government based in London, Van 't Sant served as the private secretary of the queen and was the head of the [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|Centrale Inlichtingendienst (Dutch Central Intelligence Service)]] (CID) with the rank of major-general. The CID was an intelligence service for gathering information, supporting the resistance and committing sabotage in the German occupied Netherlands.\n\nVan 't Sant and the CID cooperated closely with the foreign intelligence division of [[MI6]], known as [[MI9|British Military Intelligence Section 9]]. Young volunteers were sent as secret agents into the Netherlands. They were trained by MI6, before being dropped by air or boat in the Netherlands. Due to bad training, insufficient preparation and betrayal many of these were arrested and executed by the Germans. Van 't Sant was not involved with the sending of Dutch agents into Holland by the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], which was being double played by the SD and [[Abwehr]] in the so-called [[Englandspiel]].\n\n\nGiven his aggregation of several functions, some people felt Van 't Sant was getting too powerful. In August 1941 he was forced to resign as head of the CID, though he remained active as an advisor to the Queen and director of Police. Many who escaped from the Netherlands were interrogated by him to establish their trustworthiness, out of fear of German infiltrators. Amongst these refugees were resistance heroes such as [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]] and [[Peter Tazelaar]]. Many influential exiles, as well as resistance figures in the Netherlands, conspired against Van 't Sant as they did not trust him and considered him a [[Rasputin, Grigory Yefimovich|Rasputin]] figure. Unjustified rumours had it he was a German spy. In 1944 the queen fired him as her private secretary under pressure of prime minister [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy|Gerbrandy]] who was backed by [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nAfter the Netherlands was liberated Van 't Sant was re-united with his wife. They lived together in [[Torquay]], England, until her death in June 1950 from a stroke.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1952 Van 't Sant returned to the Netherlands to live in Rotterdam, to be closer to his daughter. Once back, he soon became a confidant again of the Royal Family. As such he got involved in the so-called '[[Greet Hofmans]] Affair'. Greet Hofmans was a female faith healer, hand layer and pacifist, who gained a lot of influence on [[Queen Juliana]]. Although Prince-consort [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Bernhard, Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld]], had introduced Hofmans in 1948 to the queen in order to cure their youngest daughter, [[Princess Christina of the Netherlands|Princess Christina]], he soon distrusted her and tried to send her away. When this failed he leaked to the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], who published an article on 13 June 1956 which brought the affair in the open. It resulted in a pitched battle between the Queen and her husband, who was supported by his oldest daughter, the future [[Queen Beatrix]]. The affair led to a severe crisis in the Royal marriage. A commission was created to investigate the affair and Van 't Sant acted as an important witness, as he was trusted by both parties. In the end the queen was forced to expel Hofmans from her court.\n\nIn the morning of 3 June 1966 Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant died in his sleep at the age of 83 in Rotterdam.\n\n==Portrayal in popular culture==\nIn 1977 Dutch film director [[Paul Verhoeven]] directed ''Soldaat van Oranje'' which was internationally distributed as ''[[Soldier of Orange]]''. The film is loosely based on the memoirs of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (see above), who is portrayed by [[Rutger Hauer]]. Van 't Sant appears as 'Van der Zanden'. His person also plays a major role in the television series ''Wilhelmina'' (NCRV, 2001). A Van 't Sant character appeared in the musical version of ''[[Soldier of Orange (musical)|Soldaat van Oranje]]'', which premi\u00e8red in the Netherlands in 2010. The production was very successful, and toured the world in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-soldier-orange-theater-20161225-story.html|last=Bradner|first=Liesl |title='Soldier of Orange': It's the 'Hamilton' of the Netherlands, and it's immersive theater to an extreme|date=22 December 2016|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Arlman, Hugo & Gerard Mulder ''Van de prins geen kwaad'' (From the prince do not know evil) Amsterdam: Sijthoff, 1983. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Doolaard, A. den ''Londen en de zaak Van 't Sant'' (London and the Van 't Sant' case) Amsterdam: Querido, 1980. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Jong, Loe de ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' (The Kingdom of the Netherlands in World War II) The Hague: SDU, 1969-1994 {{in lang|nl}}\n* Ruis, Edwin ''Spynest.

In both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] he played a key role in combined Dutch-British intelligence operations.\n\n==Early career==\nHe was born in 1883 in the naval town of [[Den Helder]] as the eight child of Laurens van 't Sant and N\u00e9line Fran\u00e7ois. His father was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. His youth was mostly spend in the city of [[Utrecht]]. In 1906 he became a clerk within the [[Rotterdam]] Municipal Police Corps, a starters function for future police officers. He impressed his superiors so much that after an unusual short period of six months he was promoted inspector trainee. He served in Rotterdam's roughest neighbourhood, Rodezand, where sailors from all over the world would meet prostitutes. In 1910 he was promoted to inspector 3rd class and head of the River Police unit. On 27 August 1914 he married the Swedish [[soprano]] Kerstin (Greta) Margaretha Jonsson, after he had met her at a Wagner performance in Rotterdam during an international tour. In June 1915 the couple had a daughter.\n\n==World War I==\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]] Van 't Sant was tasked with controlling foreign [[secret agent]]s operating in [[Rotterdam]]. He also became an officer in the Dutch military intelligence and security service [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|GSIII]]. Because of its location and Dutch [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] the international port city become the war's largest spy centre. At an early stage Van 't Sant met [[Richard B. Tinsley|Richard Tinsley]], a maritime agent turned station chief of the British secret service now known as the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] or MI6. Between him and Tinsley a co-operation developed where the Rotterdam police would tolerate British intelligence operations directed against [[Germany]] in return for sharing the gathered intelligence. Van 't Sant attempted to establish a similar arrangement with the German secret services operating in Rotterdam, but no arrangement could be reached as the German services did not trust him.\n\nThanks to his ability to control foreign secret services and his dealings with Tinsley, at the age of 33 Inspector Van 't Sant was promoted to [[commissioner|head-commissioner]] (Chief of Police) of the city of Utrecht in November 1916. In 1918 the Germans approached him to establish contacts with the British government to begin the peace negotiations which brought the war to an end. Van 't Sant was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] by [[King George V]] in January 1920, a rare honour for non-British citizens.{{sfn|Ruis|2016|p= }}\n\n==Prince Henry==\nIn October 1920 Van 't Sant became head-commissioner of [[The Hague]], a more prestigious post than Utrecht, as it involved regular contacts with the Royal House and key government figures. Queen Wilhelmina employed Van 't Sant as her odd-job man. One of his main tasks would be to keep Prince-consort [[Prince Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], out of trouble. Next to his only legitimate daughter [[Princess Juliana of the Netherlands]], the future queen, Prince Henry had fathered several illegitimate children for which Van 't Sant had to make regular payments. Henry's philandering life style also involved regular visits to prostitutes. With knowledge of the queen, Van 't Sant invited prostitutes to his private home in The Hague in order to better control them and assess their health, before Prince Henry would enter through the back door and spend some time with them in Van 't Sant's guest room.{{sfn|Arlman & Mulder|1983|pp=57-58}}\n\nIn the 1930s Van 't Sant would become entangled in the 'Elisabeth le Roi Affair'. This affair was centred around a possible mistress of Prince Henry named Elisabeth le Roi, very likely a [[pseudonym]]. Van 't Sant pretended that her illegitimate child was fathered by the recently deceased [[Jonkheer]] Carel van Vredenburch, a former high ranking, rich and upper class Dutch diplomat. Van 't Sant convinced Vredenburch's heirs that the child was Vredenburch's and in order to avoid public embarrassment he had to pay the woman [[hush money]] and make her and her child disappear. But soon Vredenburch's family started to suspect Van 't Sant was swindling them as part of an ordinary blackmail scheme. An unofficial investigation and informal tribunal by three selected members of the ruling class followed. The tribunal acquitted Van 't Sant, but did reproach him for unprofessional behaviour.
