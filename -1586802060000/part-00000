After the team locates Kort and finally kills him, Tony visits Gibbs and announces he will resign so he can take care of Tali as a single dad, intending on taking her to Israel to \"look for some answers\" and then to Paris, as \"Ziva loves Paris,\" showing his belief that Ziva may still be alive as her body had never been found.

Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Ashurbanipal]] a century later and finally expelled from Egypt by [[Psamtik I]].\n\nDuring [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Mero\u00eb]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Afterwards the [[Nubians]] established the three, eventually [[Christianity|Christianized]], kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{infobox hieroglyphs\n|title=''Kush''\n|name = <center><hiero>k-G1-S:N25</hiero></center>\n|name transcription = k3\u0161\n|name explanation = ''Ku'sh''\n}}\nThe native name of the Kingdom was recorded in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''{{lang|egy|k3\u0161}}'', likely pronounced {{IPA-all|ku\u026bu\u0283|}} or {{IPA-all|ku\u0294u\u0283|}} in [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]], when the term was first used for Nubia, based on the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]-era [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] transliteration as the genitive ''k\u016bsi''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Esarhaddon and Egypt: An Analysis of the First Invasion of Egypt|last = Spalinger|first = Anthony|date = 1974|journal = Orientalia, NOVA SERIES, Vol. 43 Pp. 295-326, XI|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&dq=ancient+egyptian+allen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-07-11|access-date = 2015-04-15|isbn = 9781107032460|first = James P.|last = Allen|page = 53}}</ref>\n\nIt is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush.

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples.

The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000).

The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180\u2013170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.<ref name=\"Howf\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133\u2013134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Mero\u00eb/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700\u2013300 BC), and first appears in the second century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the [[Old Nubian language]] of the successor Nubian kingdoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html |title=\"Meroe: Writing\", ''Digital Egypt,'' University College, London |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related.

Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Ashurbanipal]] a century later and finally expelled from Egypt by [[Psamtik I]].\n\nDuring [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Mero\u00eb]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]].

The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Mero\u00eb around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114\u2013117,120}}</ref>\n\nThe Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves.

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars.

Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating expos\u00e9, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': Do you deny that Nigel would have stayed if you had sacked Professor Alan Walters?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I don't know. I don't know.<br>'''Brian Walden''': You never even thought to ask him that?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I ... that is not ... I don't know.

He was also a member of the board of [[ITV Central|Central Television]] between 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1978, Walden told Conservative MP [[Bernard Weatherill]] that \"the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/> By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that \"the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law\".<ref name=\"Moore2\">Moore, ''Volume One'', p. 509, n.</ref> The week after this conversation, Walden's programme focused on the necessity of legislation against [[Solidarity action|secondary action]] by trade unions.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>\n\nIn 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that ''Weekend World'' had  become \"the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama\":\n\n<blockquote>The secret of Weekend World's success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television\u2014only Sir [[Robin Day]] is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: \"I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It's always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean\".<ref>Geoffrey Wansell, 'Why Walden's World grabs headlines', ''The Times'' (11 September 1981), p. 40.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term \"Victorian values\" to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105087 |title=TV Interview for London Weekend Television Weekend World (\"Victorian Values\") |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 16 January 1983|accessdate= 8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 182.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 8.</ref> Walden wrote Thatcher's speech to the Wembley rally during the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] campaign.<ref>Campbell, p. 201.</ref> In 1988, he called Thatcher \"a unique politician...the master spirit of our age\".<ref>Campbell, p. 470.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Rupert Murdoch]] moved the production of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from Fleet Street to a new plant in [[Wapping]] in January 1986, the print unions voted to [[Wapping dispute|strike]] in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper's editor, [[Andrew Neil]]: \"I don't ''need'' to write for ''The Sunday Times''. I ''want'' to\".<ref>Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Pan, 1997), p. 173.</ref> In April 1988 Walden joined [[Norman Tebbit]], [[Frank Chapple|Lord Chapple]] and [[Lord Marsh]] in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat \"privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism\" and to put in their place individualist solutions.<ref>John Horam, 'The age of new enlightenment', ''The Times'' (25 April 1988), p. 12.</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 1989 the Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]]. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating expos\u00e9, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': Do you deny that Nigel would have stayed if you had sacked Professor Alan Walters?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I don't know. I don't know.<br>'''Brian Walden''': You never even thought to ask him that?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I ... that is not ... I don't know. Nigel had determined that he was going to put in his resignation. I did everything possible to stop him.<br>'''Brian Walden''': But...<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I was not successful.

I don't know ... of course I just don't know ... I'm not going on with this.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in the interview Walden put to her:\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': You come over as being someone who one of your backbenchers said is slightly off her trolley, authoritarian, domineering, refusing to listen to anybody else \u2013 why? Why cannot you publicly project what you have just told me is your private character?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': Brian, if anyone's coming over as domineering in this interview, it's you.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107808 |title=TV Interview for ''The Walden Interview'' (Lawson's resignation) |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 28 October 1989|accessdate= 23 May 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe following Sunday, Walden interviewed Lawson. In his memoirs Lawson said that Walden was \"at that time probably the most formidable and serious political interviewer in the business\".<ref>Nigel Lawson, ''The View From No. 11. Memoirs of a Tory Radical'' (London: Bantam, 1992), p. 967.</ref>\n\nUpon leaving ''Weekend World'' as presenter in 1986, Walden was succeeded by [[Matthew Parris]],<ref name=\"BFIWalden\" /> formerly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[West Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]]; the series came to an end two years later.

The J Records second album ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]'' was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004 frontman [[Ryan McCombs]] left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of [[Drowning Pool]] the following year.\n\nThe band recruited ex- Diesel Machine vocalist [[A Cavalier|AJ Cavalier]] as its new singer and released two more studio albums (True Self, Picture Perfect) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. SOiL continued to tour worldwide and met with strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until in fall 2011, Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs for a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, ''Scars''. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (Bass) and Adam Zadel (Guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from inception until present. The band has sold over two million records worldwide and released its sixth studio album, entitled ''Whole'', on August 20, 2013 (August 16 UK/Europe).\nThe band released a greatest hits album, titled Scream: The Essentials on September 15, 2017\n\n==History==\nSoil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of [[death metal]] act [[Oppressor]], joined by guitarist of another death metal act [[Broken Hope]] \u2013 as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.\n\nThe original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song \"Rotten Soil\" by opting to simply drop the \"Rotten\" part and stick with \"Soil\".\n\nSoil's first three releases, ''[[SOiL (EP)|Soil]]'' ([[Extended play|EP]]), ''[[El Chupacabra (album)|El Chupacabra]]'' (EP) and their debut album ''[[Throttle Junkies]]'', failed to break the band into the mainstream. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.\n\nWith the song \"Halo\" gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend [[Clive Davis]], responsible for signing such acts as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], who stated that \"you're gonna be my only rock band for now. You're going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.\"<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soil.htm|title = Interview: Soil|publisher = musicOMH|last = Bansal|first = Vik|date = January 2005|accessdate = 26 February 2012}}</ref> Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the [[major label]] debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', released September 11, 2001.<ref name=OMH/> This achievement was aided by the popular singles \"Halo\" and \"Unreal\" which gained the band exposure on [[MTV]]. The success resulted in the band winning [[Metal Edge]] magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Award for \"Next Big Thing\".<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the band released their second major label album, ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]''. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates.  Shortly after, vocalist [[Ryan McCombs]] announced his departure from the group to be with his family,<ref name=OMH/> forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. [[New York City|New York]]-based vocalist [[AJ Cavalier]], previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004 as McCombs' replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.\n\nOn September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York-based [[independent label]] [[DRT Entertainment]]. Their album ''[[True Self]]'' was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. SOiL embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.\n\nOn October 20, 2009 the album ''[[Picture Perfect (Soil album)|Picture Perfect]]'' was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. ''Picture Perfect'' was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single, \"Like It Is.\" In January 2010, \"The Lesser Man\" was announced as a second single.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J.

The J Records second album ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]'' was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004 frontman [[Ryan McCombs]] left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of [[Drowning Pool]] the following year.\n\nThe band recruited ex- Diesel Machine vocalist [[A Cavalier|AJ Cavalier]] as its new singer and released two more studio albums (True Self, Picture Perfect) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. SOiL continued to tour worldwide and met with strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until in fall 2011, Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs for a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, ''Scars''. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (Bass) and Adam Zadel (Guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from inception until present. The band has sold over two million records worldwide and released its sixth studio album, entitled ''Whole'', on August 20, 2013 (August 16 UK/Europe).\nThe band released a greatest hits album, titled Scream: The Essentials on September 15, 2017\n\n==History==\nSoil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of [[death metal]] act [[Oppressor]], joined by guitarist of another death metal act [[Broken Hope]] \u2013 as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.\n\nThe original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song \"Rotten Soil\" by opting to simply drop the \"Rotten\" part and stick with \"Soil\".\n\nSoil's first three releases, ''[[SOiL (EP)|Soil]]'' ([[Extended play|EP]]), ''[[El Chupacabra (album)|El Chupacabra]]'' (EP) and their debut album ''[[Throttle Junkies]]'', failed to break the band into the mainstream. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.\n\nWith the song \"Halo\" gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend [[Clive Davis]], responsible for signing such acts as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], who stated that \"you're gonna be my only rock band for now. You're going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.\"<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soil.htm|title = Interview: Soil|publisher = musicOMH|last = Bansal|first = Vik|date = January 2005|accessdate = 26 February 2012}}</ref> Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the [[major label]] debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', released September 11, 2001.<ref name=OMH/> This achievement was aided by the popular singles \"Halo\" and \"Unreal\" which gained the band exposure on [[MTV]]. The success resulted in the band winning [[Metal Edge]] magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Award for \"Next Big Thing\".<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the band released their second major label album, ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]''. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates.  Shortly after, vocalist [[Ryan McCombs]] announced his departure from the group to be with his family,<ref name=OMH/> forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. [[New York City|New York]]-based vocalist [[AJ Cavalier]], previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004 as McCombs' replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.\n\nOn September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York-based [[independent label]] [[DRT Entertainment]]. Their album ''[[True Self]]'' was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. SOiL embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.\n\nOn October 20, 2009 the album ''[[Picture Perfect (Soil album)|Picture Perfect]]'' was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. ''Picture Perfect'' was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single, \"Like It Is.\" In January 2010, \"The Lesser Man\" was announced as a second single.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J. Cavalier, and drummer Tom Schofield announced their departure from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013007/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143229|title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET \u2013 SOIL Singer On 'Indefinite Hiatus' From Band; Drummer Seeking 'New Musical Opportunities'|date=28 July 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref> Vocalist Jordan Lee and drummer Mike Tignino were announced as fill-ins for scheduled live dates.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 It's Official: SOIL Recruits 'Fill-In' Singer, Drummer For Upcoming Shows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728051402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 |date=2010-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe band reunited with original vocalist Ryan McCombs for a 12-date co-headlining UK tour with [[Puddle of Mudd]] in October 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ''Scars''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. '''Cynic took a 12 year hiatus''' in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] '''and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film.''' \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television.

The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album ''Kindly Bent to Free Us''. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums titled ''Mythical Human Vessel.''

He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. \n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 st\u00e4rksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=K\u00f6nigswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

[[Vineyard]]s in the region date back to 1867.\n\n==Climate and geography==\nThe AVA boundaries include the smaller [[Fennville AVA]] and extend as far as {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} inland from the lakeshore; however, the climate and [[glacial moraine]] soils are relatively similar throughout. The \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" off of [[Lake Michigan]] tempers the northern climate. Lake Michigan Shore AVA has a warmer growing season, as much as two weeks longer than the only other Michigan AVAs, [[Leelanau Peninsula AVA]], and [[Old Mission Peninsula AVA]], both of which are in [[Northern Michigan]]. The [[hardiness zone]] is 6a except near enough to Lake Michigan in [[Berrien County, Michigan|Berrien County]] where it is 6b.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.michiganwines.com Michigan Wines]\n\n{{Coord|42.2|-86.1|type:landmark_region:US-MI|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Allegan County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:American Viticultural Areas]]\n[[Category:Geography of Berrien County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Michigan wine]]\n[[Category:Geography of Cass County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Geography of Van Buren County, Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "Melodies1917", "label": "safe", "comment": "no inline references template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan_Shore_AVA"}

Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world.

The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.\n\n==Eras of music==\n{{Music eras}}\n\n===Prehistoric music===\n{{Main|Prehistoric music}}\nPrehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]].

The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]].

Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226\u2013651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.\n\nThe [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].\n\n'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}\nGreek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]].

The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1\u20136). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4\u20136; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>\n\nMusic and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>\n\n:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class\u2014which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>\n\n===Early music===\n{{Main|Early music}}\nEarly music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.\nyou can shove it\n\n==Western art music==\n{{History of Western art music}}\n\n{{Main|Western art music}}\n\n===Medieval music===\n{{Main|Medieval music}}\nWhile musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].\n\nDuring the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.\n\nSeveral schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouv\u00e8re]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnes\u00e4nger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.\n\nForms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].\n\n===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].\n\nThe invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.\n\nMost parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesur\u00e9e]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.\n\nOne of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.\n\nMusic prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].\n\n===Baroque music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Baroque music}}\n[[File:Bernardo Strozzi - Claudio Monteverdi (c.1630).jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of Italian composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in [[Venice]], by [[Bernardo Strozzi]], c. 1630]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance?

Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].\n\n===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Classical period (music)}}\nThe music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).\n\n[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]\nAlong with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.\n\n===Romantic music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Romantic music}}\n[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;\u2013 and often much longer&nbsp;\u2013 musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].\n\n===20th and 21st-century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n[[File:'Free Concerts' Radio Dealer poster (1922).jpg|thumb|The radio transformed listening habits after 1920]]\nMusic of all kinds also became increasingly portable.

The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"[[Music history]]\" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.\n\n==Eras of music==\n{{Music eras}}\n\n===Prehistoric music===\n{{Main|Prehistoric music}}\nPrehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents \u2013 especially that which still survives \u2013 as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]].

The \"oldest known song\" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',<ref>Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}</ref> and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]].

One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages.

[[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.\n\n[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.\n\nThe history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500\u2013644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226\u2013651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.\n\nThe [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].\n\n'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}\nGreek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.\n\n===Biblical period===\n{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}\n[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|<center>\"David with his harp\" [[Paris Psalter]],<br> c. 960, [[Constantinople]]</center>]]\nAccording to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1\u20136). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4\u20136; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).<ref>''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', \"Music\", 1897</ref>\n\nMusic and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called [[litany]],\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"<ref name=JRT>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html \"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.</ref>\n\n:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the \"father of all such as handle the harp and pipe\", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. \"One finds in the biblical text\", writes Alfred Sendrey, \"a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class\u2014which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].<ref name=JRT/>\n\n===Early music===\n{{Main|Early music}}\nEarly music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.\n\n==Western art music==\n{{History of Western art music}}\n\n{{Main|Western art music}}\n\n===Medieval music===\n{{Main|Medieval music}}\nWhile musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].\n\nDuring the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.\n\nSeveral schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouv\u00e8re]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnes\u00e4nger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.\n\nForms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].\n\n===Renaissance music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n[[Image:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].\n\nThe invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.\n\nMost parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesur\u00e9e]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.\n\nOne of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.\n\nMusic prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].\n\n===Baroque music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Baroque music}}\n[[File:Bernardo Strozzi - Claudio Monteverdi (c.1630).jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of Italian composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in [[Venice]], by [[Bernardo Strozzi]], c. 1630]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}<!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--> German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.<ref name=\"sdsu\">{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].\n\n===Classical music era===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Classical period (music)}}\nThe music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).\n\n[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]\nAlong with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.\n\n===Romantic music===<!-- This section is linked from History of music -->\n{{Main|Romantic music}}\n[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&nbsp;\u2013 and often much longer&nbsp;\u2013 musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9|Faur\u00e9]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].\n\n===20th and 21st-century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n[[File:'Free Concerts' Radio Dealer poster (1922).jpg|thumb|The radio transformed listening habits after 1920]]\nMusic of all kinds also became increasingly portable.

Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals.

The route then turns north to form a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 207|SH&nbsp;207]] up to [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], where [[U.S. Route 70|US&nbsp;70]] joins in for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east and then SH&nbsp;207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;70 then east through [[Matador, Texas|Matador]] to [[Paducah, Texas|Paducah]], and north again dropping off US&nbsp;70 and gaining [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]] through [[Childress, Texas|Childress]] to a point {{convert|17|mi|km}} to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]].\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest [[Oklahoma]] through [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]], [[Gould, Oklahoma|Gould]] and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] and then continues east bypassing the communities of [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]] and [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]] into [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. On the north side of Lawton, US&nbsp;62 joins [[I-44]] as a concurrent route for {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill Military Reservation]] and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through [[Apache, Oklahoma|Apache]] then north and east toward [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]]. From Anadarko, US&nbsp;62 runs east through [[Verden, Oklahoma|Verden]] to [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] and northeast through [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into [[Oklahoma City]] and then with [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|I-240]] and [[I-35]] through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the Oklahoma State Capitol. It leaves Oklahoma City at 23rd street and heads east through [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], [[Nicoma Park, Oklahoma|Nicoma Park]], [[Choctaw, Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]], [[Meeker, Oklahoma|Meeker]] and [[Boley, Oklahoma|Boley]] to [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]]. At Okemah, US&nbsp;62 overlaps [[I-40]] for {{convert|18|mi|km}} to [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]. US&nbsp;62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] and east to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], and heads northeast through [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]] and [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and into Arkansas.\n\nIn addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US&nbsp;62 also runs concurrent with other US&nbsp;highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US&nbsp;281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US&nbsp;277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US&nbsp;81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US&nbsp;277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US&nbsp;75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US&nbsp;64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US&nbsp;69 in the Muskogee city limits. US&nbsp;62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas}}\n[[File:US&nbsp;62 near Busch, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] west of [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]].]]\nIn the state of [[Arkansas]], US&nbsp;62 runs {{convert|329.9|mi|km}} from the [[Oklahoma]] border near [[Summers, Arkansas|Summers]] east to the [[Missouri]] border in [[St. Francis, Arkansas|St. Francis]], serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas |Prairie Grove]], [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]], [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocahontas]], and [[Piggott, Arkansas|Piggott]]. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.\n\n===Missouri===\nUS&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.\n\n===Illinois===\n{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}\nUS 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].\n\nUS&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].\n\n===Ohio===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Ohio}}\n[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east\u2013west to north\u2013south. US&nbsp;62 also runs north-northeast from the Ohio border towards New York.<ref name=mapguy>{{cite web |author=Mapguy |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |title=End of U.S. Highway 62 |url=http://www.usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202030315/http://usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}{{self-published source|date=December 2014}}</ref> US&nbsp;62 passes through [[Mercer, Pennsylvania|Mercer]] and runs across country to [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]. At this point US&nbsp;62 enters the [[Allegheny River]] valley and follows this river for {{convert|45|mi|km}}. US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.\n\n===New York===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}\n[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]\nWhile most of the route is an east\u2013west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north\u2013south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north\u2013south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north\u2013south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.  The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010.  The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY.  Designations have also been successful in Illinois and Kentucky to this point.\n\n==Future==\nIn Ohio, there are plans to reroute US&nbsp;62 onto a divided highway from Alliance to [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]], part of a larger relocation of both US&nbsp;62 and [[Ohio State Route 14|SR&nbsp;14]], then from downtown Youngstown to I-80 as part of the \"Hubbard Arterial\".<ref>[http://www.eastgatecog.org/reg-trac.asp Eastgate Regional Council of Governments: T.R.A.C.

Through El Paso, US&nbsp;62 begins at the [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and follows Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive. At the Paisano Drive underpass for [[Interstate 10|I-10]] (I-10 exit 23B), US&nbsp;62 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 180|US&nbsp;180]], while US&nbsp;180 ends its concurrency with I-10. The route then follows Montana Avenue, continuing the concurrency with US&nbsp;180 until [[Seminole, Texas|Seminole]]. Before exiting Texas, the route passes through the Salt Flats of Texas, the southern base of [[Guadalupe Peak]], the highest point in Texas, and [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].\n\n===New Mexico===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in New Mexico}}\nThrough New Mexico, US&nbsp;62 is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 180 in New Mexico|US&nbsp;180]]. The highway continues past [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] and [[White's City, New Mexico|White's City]] into the city of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. In Carlsbad, [[U.S. Route 285|US&nbsp;285]] joins US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;180 for approximately {{convert|2.2|mi|km}}, then heads east to [[Hobbs, New Mexico|Hobbs]]. US&nbsp;62 comes within {{convert|12|mi|km}} of the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant|WIPP Plant]] while also coming across several State Highway termini: [[New Mexico State Road 360]] (NM&nbsp;360), [[New Mexico State Road 176|NM&nbsp;176]], [[New Mexico State Road 243|NM&nbsp;243]], [[New Mexico State Road 529|NM&nbsp;529]], [[New Mexico State Road 483|NM&nbsp;483]], [[New Mexico State Road 360|NM&nbsp;360]], and [[New Mexico State Road 8|NM&nbsp;8]] along the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. US&nbsp;62 comes into Hobbs along Marland Boulevard. After coming close to [[Hobbs High School]]'s Watson Stadium, US&nbsp;62 leaves Hobbs going east to the Texas\u2013New Mexico state line.\n\n===Texas Panhandle===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}\nAfter re-entering Texas, US&nbsp;62 continues east through Seminole where US&nbsp;180 heads east towards [[Lamesa, Texas|Lamesa]] and US&nbsp;62 turns north northeast along a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 385|US&nbsp;385]] through [[Seagraves, Texas|Seagraves]] and [[Brownfield, Texas|Brownfield]]. In Brownfield, US&nbsp;62 picks up [[U.S. Route 82|US&nbsp;82]]/[[U.S. Route 380|US&nbsp;380]] from [[Plains, Texas|Plains]] for a four-way concurrency for about two blocks, where US&nbsp;380 heads east toward [[Tahoka, Texas|Tahoka]]. US&nbsp;385 drops off approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later to head northwest toward [[Levelland, Texas|Levelland]]. US&nbsp;82 continues as a concurrency with US&nbsp;62 into [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. US&nbsp;62 splits from US&nbsp;82 and joins with [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway&nbsp;114]] (SH&nbsp;114) for approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} along the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]]'s southern border.

The route then turns north to form a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 207|SH&nbsp;207]] up to [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], where [[U.S. Route 70|US&nbsp;70]] joins in for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east and then SH&nbsp;207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;70 then east through [[Matador, Texas|Matador]] to [[Paducah, Texas|Paducah]], and north again dropping off US&nbsp;70 and gaining [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]] through [[Childress, Texas|Childress]] to a point {{convert|17|mi|km}} to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]].\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest [[Oklahoma]] through [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]], [[Gould, Oklahoma|Gould]] and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] and then continues east bypassing the communities of [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]] and [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]] into [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. On the north side of Lawton, US&nbsp;62 joins [[I-44]] as a concurrent route for {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill Military Reservation]] and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through [[Apache, Oklahoma|Apache]] then north and east toward [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]]. From Anadarko, US&nbsp;62 runs east through [[Verden, Oklahoma|Verden]] to [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] and northeast through [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into [[Oklahoma City]] and then with [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|I-240]] and [[I-35]] through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the Oklahoma State Capitol.

At Okemah, US&nbsp;62 overlaps [[I-40]] for {{convert|18|mi|km}} to [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]. US&nbsp;62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] and east to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], and heads northeast through [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]] and [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and into Arkansas.\n\nIn addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US&nbsp;62 also runs concurrent with other US&nbsp;highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US&nbsp;281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US&nbsp;277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US&nbsp;81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US&nbsp;277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US&nbsp;75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US&nbsp;64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US&nbsp;69 in the Muskogee city limits. US&nbsp;62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas}}\n[[File:US&nbsp;62 near Busch, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] west of [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]].]]\nIn the state of [[Arkansas]], US&nbsp;62 runs {{convert|329.9|mi|km}} from the [[Oklahoma]] border near [[Summers, Arkansas|Summers]] east to the [[Missouri]] border in [[St. Francis, Arkansas|St. Francis]], serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas |Prairie Grove]], [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]], [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocahontas]], and [[Piggott, Arkansas|Piggott]]. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.\n\n===Missouri===\nUS&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.\n\n===Illinois===\n{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}\nUS 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].\n\nUS&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].\n\n===Ohio===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Ohio}}\n[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east\u2013west to north\u2013south.

US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.\n\n===New York===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}\n[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]\nWhile most of the route is an east\u2013west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north\u2013south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north\u2013south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north\u2013south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.
