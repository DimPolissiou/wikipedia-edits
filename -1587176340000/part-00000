The villa was built in the early nineteenth century by a local Orthodox Christian merchant who specialized in the export of timber to Egypt.  After [[World War I]] and the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Alanya\u2019s trade routes were severed and its Christian community departed for Greece.

The villa was noticed by George McGhee and his wife Cecilia on a visit to Alanya during his tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Turkey in the 1950s.  McGhee purchased the property in 1968 and renovated it for his family\u2019s use.

{"title_page": "Flight-to-quality", "text_new": "A '''flight-to-quality''', or '''flight-to-safety''', is a financial market phenomenon occurring when investors sell what they perceive to be higher-[[risk]] investments and purchase safer investments, such as [[Gold as an investment|gold]] and other precious metals. This is considered a sign of [[fear]] in the marketplace, as investors seek less risk in exchange for lower [[Profit (accounting)|profits]].\n\nFlight-to-quality is usually accompanied by an increase in demand for assets that are government-backed and a decline in demand for assets backed by private agents.\n\n==Definition==\nMore broadly, flight-to-quality refers to a sudden shift in investment behaviors in a period of financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil. Such a portfolio shift further exposes the financial sector to negative shocks. An increase in leverage and credit spread on all but the safest and most liquid assets may incur a sudden dry up in risky asset markets, which may lead to real effects on the economy.\n\nA phenomenon that occurs with flight-to-quality is flight-to-liquidity. A [[flight-to-liquidity]] refers to an abrupt shift in large capital flows towards more liquid assets. One reason why the two appear together is that in most cases risky assets are also less liquid. Assets that are subject to the flight to quality pattern are also subject to flight to liquidity. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is less risky and more liquid than a corporate bond. Thus, most theoretical studies that attempt to explain underlying mechanisms take both flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity into account.\n\n==Mechanism==\nFlight-to-quality episodes are triggered by unusual and unexpected events.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a\nFlight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> These events are rare but the list is longer than a few. The [[Penn Central Railroad]]\u2019s default in 1970, a sudden stock market crash referred to as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the [[Russian debt default]] and collapse of [[Long Term Capital Management]] in 1998, the [[9/11 attack]] in 2001, and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008, were all unusual and unexpected events that caught market participants by surprise. The initial effects of these events were a fall in asset prices and aggregate quantity of [[liquidity]] in [[financial market]] which deteriorated balance sheets of both borrowers and investors.\n\nWorsening of initial impacts developed into a flight-to-quality pattern, as the unusual and unexpected features of the events made market participants more risk and uncertainty averse, incurring more aggressive reactions compared to responses during other shocks. Liquidation of assets and withdrawals from financial market were severe, which made a risky group of borrowers have difficulties rolling over their liabilities and financing new credits.\n\nA recent development in theory explains various mechanisms which led to enhanced initial effects of a flight-to-quality pattern.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \"Flight to Quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\" Working Paper 08-21.</ref><ref>Krishnamurthy, Arvind, 2010: \"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises.\" American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2(3): 1\u201330.</ref> These mechanisms follow from an observation that a flight-to-quality pattern involves a combination of market participants' weakening [[balance sheet]] and [[risk aversion]] of asset payoffs, extreme uncertainty aversion, and strategic or speculative behavior of liquid market participants. \n\nA \"balance sheet mechanism\" focuses on institutional features of financial markets. It provides an explanation for feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' balance sheets depend on asset prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock. Vayanos<ref>Vayanos, Dimitri (2004). \"Flight to Quality, Flight to Liquidity, and the Pricing of Risk>\" NBER Working Paper.</ref> models how a relationship between fund managers and clients can lead to effective risk aversion when illiquidity risk rises due to asset price volatility. He and Krishnamurthy<ref>He, Zhiguo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"A Model of Capital and Crises.\" Working Paper, Northwestern University.</ref> introduce [[principal\u2013agent problem]] to a model to show how specialists\u2019 capital investments are pro-cyclical. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2008) \"Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity.\" Review of Financial Studies, 22(6), 2201-2238.</ref> model [[margin requirement]] and show how volatility of asset prices tightens the requirement that lead to asset sales.\n\nAn \"information amplification mechanism\" focuses on a role of investor's extreme uncertainty aversion. When an unusual and unexpected event incurs losses, investors find that they do not have a good understanding about the tail outcome that they are facing and treat the risk as [[Knightian uncertainty]].<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" Journal of Finance 63, 2195-2230.</ref> An example is [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2008. Investors realized that they did not have good understanding about [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] which were newly adopted. Newly adopted financial innovation meant that market participants had only a short time to formulate valuation, and did not have enough history to refer to in their risk management and hedging models. Under Knightian uncertainty, investors respond by disengaging from risky activities and hoarding liquidity while reevaluating their investment models. They only take conservative approaches, investing on only safe and uncontingent claims, to protect themselves from worst-case scenarios related to the risk that they do not understand, which further deteriorates asset prices and financial market.\n\nA model of strategic or speculative behaviors of liquid investors provides another mechanism that explains flight-to-quality phenomenon. Acharya ''et al''<ref>Acharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \"Imperfect Competition in the Inter\u2010Bank Market for Liquidity.\" Working Paper, London Business School.</ref> show that during financial turmoil liquid banks in interbank loan markets do not lend their liquidity to illiquid banks, nor hoard liquidity for precautionary reasons, but, rather, hoard them to purchase assets at distress prices. Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen| Pedersen]]<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2005) \"Predatory Trading.\" The Journal of Finance, 60(4), 1825-1863.</ref> study strategic behaviors of liquid traders when they know that other traders need to liquidate their positions. The study shows that the strategic behaviors would lead to predatory pricing, which would lead the price of risky and illiquid assets to fall further than they would if price were based on risk consideration alone.\n\n==Empirical Studies==\nSince flight-to-quality phenomenon implies a shift in investing behavior towards some safe group of assets from risky assets, efforts to find evidence on flight-to-quality have been concentrated on analyzing widening yields or quantity changes between two assets. A number of studies find stronger negative association between stock and bond markets during a financial turmoil. Flight-to-quality is also observable within a safe group of assets. Longstaff<ref>Longstaff, Francis (2004) \"The Flight\u2010to\u2010Liquidity Premium in US Treasury Bond Prices.\" The Journal of Business, 77(3):511\u2010526.</ref> finds a spread between [[Resolution Funding Corporation]] bonds, whose liabilities are guaranteed by Treasury, and US Treasury bonds increases when consumer confidence drops, money market mutual funds and Treasury buy backs increase. Krishnamurthy compares on-the-run and off-the-run treasury bonds to find higher spreads on off-the \u2013run bonds are associated with higher spread between commercial paper and Treasury bonds. Beber ''et al''<ref>Beber, Alessandro, Michael Brandt, and Kenneth A. Kavajecz (2009), Flight-to-quality or Flight-to-liquidity? Evidence from the Euro-area bond market, Review of Financial Studies 22, 925-957.</ref> make explicit distinction between flight-to-quality and flight-to-liquidity and find relative importance of liquidity over credit quality rises during flight-to-quality episodes. Gatev and Strahan <ref>Gatev, Evan and Philip Strahan (2006). \"Banks' Advantage in Hedging Liquidity Risk: Theory and Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market.\" ''The Journal of Finance'', 61(2):867\u2010892.</ref> find that the spread between treasury bills and high grade [[commercial paper]] increases, banks tend to experience inflow of deposits and decreased cost of funding. This suggests that banks tend to be seen as [[:wikt:safe haven|safe havens]] in periods of turmoil. However, data shows that during 1998 the flight-to-quality episodes worsening relative position of banks compared to the very safe assets.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008). \"Collective risk management in a Fight to quality episode.\" ''Journal of Finance'' 63, 2195-2230.</ref>\n\n==Real sector effects==\nDuring a flight-to-quality episode [[external financing]] becomes harder for lower quality borrowers or riskier projects. Investors faced with tightened balance sheet and increased risk and uncertainty aversion reduce their investment and shift their portfolio only towards safer projects and high quality borrowers.\nTightening external financing for lower quality borrowers may extend to real consequences of output loss and higher unemployment, therefore exacerbate business cycle. A series of studies show that amount and composition of firm's external financing from bank loans are countercyclical during flight-to quality periods. Kashyap ''et al'' <ref>Kashyap, Anil, Jeremy Stein, and David Wilcox (1993).\"Monetary Policy and Credit Conditions: Evidence from the Composition of External Finance.\" American Economic Review, 83(1), 78\u201098.</ref> finds that quantity of commercial paper issuances of high quality firms increase relative to bank loans. Since lower quality firms lack external financing ability via commercial paper issuance, lower quality firms are likely to be deprived from financial resources. Gertler and Gilchrist<ref>Gertler, Mark and Simon Gilchrist (1994), \"Monetary Policy, Business Cycles, and the Behavior of Small Manufacturing Firms.\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics,109(2), 309-340.</ref> find similar result of relative proportion of loans being increased to larger firms, and Oliner and Rudebusch <ref>Oliner, Stephen and Glenn Rudebusch (1995).\u201cIs There a Bank Lending Channel for Monetary Policy?\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Review 2, 3\u201320.</ref> find new loans made to safer projects are countercyclical during flight-to-quality episodes. Bernanke ''et al''<ref>Bernanke, Ben, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist (1996), \"The Financial Accelerator and the Flight to Quality.\" The Review of Economics and Statistics, 78(1), 1\u201015.</ref> compare differences in performances between small and large firms during a flight-to-quality episode, and find evidence that the differences explain as much as one third of aggregate fluctuations.\n\n==Policy implications==\nA [[moral hazard]] concern generally provides a rationale that government should not intervene in a financial crisis.<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \"Flight to quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\" Working Paper 08-21.</ref> The argument is that a market participant who expects government [[bailout]]s or emergency financing would engage in excessive risk taking. However, various government policy tools have been proposed to alleviate the effect of flight-to-quality phenomenon. The argument for [[government intervention]] is that flight-to-quality phenomenon is a result of insufficient risk taking generated by Knightian uncertainty. There is also an inefficiency issue generated by [[externality]] that supports rationale for prudential policy. The externality is generated when in presence of illiquid market, each firm forced to sell illiquid assets depresses prices for everyone else but does not take this effect into account in its decision-making. The externality also enables strategic and speculative behaviors of liquid investors. \n\nCaballero and Krishnamurthy<ref>Caballero, Ricardo and Pablo Kurlat (2008). \"Flight to quality and Bailouts: Policy Remarks and a Literature Review.\" Working Paper 08-21.</ref> show that central bank acting as a [[lender of last resort]] would be effective when both balance sheet and information amplifier mechanisms are at work. For instance, a [[guarantee]] issuance by government or loans to distressed private sectors would sustain deteriorating asset prices, bring confidence back in financial market, and prevent [[fire sale]] of assets. Brock and Manski<ref>Brock, Willian and Charles Manski (2008). \"Competitive Lending with Partial Knowledge of Loan Repayment\". Working paper, University of Wisconsin.</ref> argue that government's guarantee on minimum returns on investment can restore investor's confidence when Knightian uncertainty is prevalent.\n\nAcharya ''et al''<ref>Acharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \"Imperfect Competition in the Inter\u2010Bank Market for Liquidity.\" Working Paper, London Business School.</ref> argue that the central bank's role as a lender of last resort can also support smooth functioning of interbank markets. The loan from the central bank to distressed banks would improve their outside option in bargaining. Thus less efficient asset sales would not be necessary and liquid banks would not be able to behave monopolistically. Brunnermeier and Pedersen<ref>Brunnermeier, Markus and Lasse Pedersen (2005) \"Predatory Trading.\" The Journal of Finance, 60(4), 1825-1863.</ref> propose short selling restrictions and [[trading halt]]s to eliminate predatory behaviors of liquid traders.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hec.unil.ch/abeber/research/flights.pdf Flight-to-Quality or Flight-to-Liquidity?]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109125038/http://www.thestreet.com/university/personalfinance/10388158.html A Primer on Flight to Quality]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{stock market}}\n\n[[Category:Financial problems]]\n[[Category:Financial markets]]\n", "text_old": "A '''flight-to-quality''', or '''flight-to-safety''', is a financial market phenomenon occurring when investors sell what they perceive to be higher-[[risk]] investments and purchase safer investments, such as [[Gold as an investment|gold]] and other precious metals.

Working paper, University of Wisconsin.</ref> argue that government's guarantee on minimum returns on investment can restore investor's confidence when Knightian uncertainty is prevalent.\n\nAcharya ''et al''<ref>Acharya Viral, Denis Gromb, and Tanju Yorulmazer (2008). \"Imperfect Competition in the Inter\u2010Bank Market for Liquidity.\" Working Paper, London Business School.</ref> argue that the central bank's role as a lender of last resort can also support smooth functioning of interbank markets. The loan from the central bank to distressed banks would improve their outside option in bargaining. Thus less efficient asset sales would not be necessary and liquid banks would not be able to behave monopolistically.

It is divided into the North Campus and the South Campus (also referred to by staff and students as the \"new\" and \"old\" campuses respectively). The campuses were connected by means of a footbridge that crossed over the road until mid-2011. The footbridge was then decommissioned due to the construction of a library extension on the South Campus. The campuses are now connected by means of a pedestrian crossing on the Kilcock Road.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The campus has four buildings for on campus accommodation, namely Rye, Village, River, and Courtyard.\n\n=== South Campus ===\n[[File:Maynooth Castle4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Maynooth Castle]] at the South Campus gates]]\nThe South Campus houses the facilities of St. Patrick's College, as well as most of the administrative offices shared between college and university. A number of MU academic departments also have their offices on the South Campus including Law, Mathematics, Music, Geography, Economics and History. The main buildings, most of which were built in the 19th century, are the [[Aula Maxima, Maynooth|Aula Maxima]]; St. Patrick's House (including the college chapel); the [[John Paul II]] Library (built in 1984). In December 2012 a new extension to the John Paul II library was completed. The extension is 6,000m<sup>2</sup> and accommodates 1,700 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acei.ie/awards/john-paul-ii-library-extension-nui-maynooth|title=ACEI|website=House of Tiles|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> New, Dunboyne, Humanity and Stoyte Houses which collectively form St. Joseph's Square; Logic House and Rhetoric House.\nThe first building to be completed on the South Campus was named after its designer, John Stoyte. Stoyte House, still a prominent presence on campus, stands in proximity to [[Maynooth Castle]].\n[[File:Graveyards.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Graveyard on South Campus, showing how the trees converge like a [[vault (architecture)|vault]].]]\n\nOver a period of 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St. Joseph's Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824. The university chapel is located on the South Campus, just off St. Joseph's Square; masses and choir services are frequently held in the chapel, as is the traditional Christmas carol service. The South Campus also houses the [[National Science Museum at Maynooth|National Science Museum]] and the [[Russell Library (St. Patrick's College)|Russell Library]].\n\n=== North Campus ===\nThe North Campus was developed far more recently than the South Campus, in the latter half of the 20th century. Here, the main buildings are the Students' Union building, Sports Complex, Biosciences, and Engineering Building, Callan Science Building (named after the inventor of the induction coil, [[Nicholas Callan]]), the Iontas building, the Arts Building, the Science Building and the [[John Hume]] Building. The Eolas Building houses the department of Computer Science, the Business Incubation Centre, the Innovation Value Institute, as well as the Hamilton and Callan Institutes, along with several teaching spaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunnlennonfabrications.com/National%20University%20of%20Ireland%20%20Maynooth%20%E2%80%93%20ICT%20Hub.html/|title=ICT Hub Maynooth|access-date=18 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212042651/http://gunnlennonfabrications.com/National%20University%20of%20Ireland%20%20Maynooth%20%E2%80%93%20ICT%20Hub.html|archive-date=12 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe student services function is also based on North Campus, and there are a number of playing fields and a sports complex, which includes a fully equipped gym and an astroturf field.

A number of MU academic departments also have their offices on the South Campus including Law, Mathematics, Music, Geography, Economics and History. The main buildings, most of which were built in the 19th century, are the [[Aula Maxima, Maynooth|Aula Maxima]]; St. Patrick's House (including the college chapel); the [[John Paul II]] Library (built in 1984). In December 2012 a new extension to the John Paul II library was completed. The extension is 6,000m<sup>2</sup> and accommodates 1,700 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acei.ie/awards/john-paul-ii-library-extension-nui-maynooth|title=ACEI|website=House of Tiles|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> New, Dunboyne, Humanity and Stoyte Houses which collectively form St. Joseph's Square; Logic House and Rhetoric House.\nThe first building to be completed on the South Campus was named after its designer, John Stoyte. Stoyte House, still a prominent presence on campus, stands in proximity to [[Maynooth Castle]].\n[[File:Graveyards.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Graveyard on South Campus, showing how the trees converge like a [[vault (architecture)|vault]].]]\n\nOver a period of 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St. Joseph's Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824. The university chapel is located on the South Campus, just off St. Joseph's Square; masses and choir services are frequently held in the chapel, as is the traditional Christmas carol service. The South Campus also houses the [[National Science Museum at Maynooth|National Science Museum]] and the [[Russell Library (St. Patrick's College)|Russell Library]].\n\n=== North Campus ===\nThe North Campus was developed far more recently than the South Campus, in the latter half of the 20th century.

When it was founded in the early 1950s, the size of the college was 417.87 acres. It was bounded by Moulmein-Taungwaing, main road and Moulmein-Amherst roads. On the east side of the site, there is a mountain called Taungwaing mountain, half a mile away from the college. About a quarter of a mile away from the college across the Moulmein-Taungwaing road, there was a former WWII airfield (now [[Mawlamyine Airport]]).\n\nBefore construction of the college, Taungwaing mountain and its surrounding areas had been a camping site for the British administrators and local elites and the gardens of local [[Chinese people in Myanmar|Chinese]] community during the [[British rule in Burma|colonial period]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. According to [[Howard Malcom]] in 1836, early settlers of the Moulmein Chinese community made a living by growing vegetables and fruits in Taungwaing (hill-circle in Burmese, ''ling-ding'' in Chinese) and its surrounding areas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Revisiting the Nineteenth- century Marketplace, and the Chinese Community in Moulmein|last=Li|first=Yi|publisher=Center for Burma Studies Northern Illinois University|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=73}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIt was renamed '''Mawlamyaing Degree College''' in 1964.

Most of the on-campus accommodations were built in the 1950s. Following pro-democracy protest in 1988, on-campus accommodation was closed by the authority, and it was reopened only in 2013.\n\nThe on-campus accommodation is operated by Mawlamyine University\u2019s Students\u2019 Affairs Department. Currently, there are five halls of residence in the campus; namely Thandar, Mawlamyine (Moulmein), Nilar (Sapphire), Pu-le (Pearl) and Shwe Myaing building.

The site of the college was located at about four miles away from the north east of the downtown section of Moulmein (Mawlamyine). When it was founded in the early 1950s, the size of the college was 417.87 acres. It was bounded by Moulmein-Taungwaing, main road and Moulmein-Amherst roads. On the east side of the site, there is a mountain called Taungwaing mountain, half a mile away from the college. About a quarter of a mile away from the college across the Moulmein-Taungwaing road, there was a former WWII airfield (now [[Mawlamyine Airport]]).\n\nBefore construction of the college, Taungwaing mountain and its surrounding areas had been a camping site for the British administrators and local elites and the gardens of local [[Chinese people in Myanmar|Chinese]] community during the [[British rule in Burma|colonial period]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

It later separated into its own organization in 1997, and was formally made a university in 2004.\n\n==History==\nIn Indonesia, State Islamic Institutes (''Institut Agama Islam Negeri'', IAIN) trace their origins from Islamic boarding schools known as [[pesantren]]. On 1961, the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] founded branches of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga [[Yogyakarta]] in the cities of [[Surabaya]] and [[Malang]]. The Malang branch acted as the faculty of ''Tarbiyah'' (Islamic education). Later on, the three were merged into IAIN Sunan Ampel before the Malang branch separated in 1997, due to a presidential decree mandating the creation of separate Islamic institutes (referred to as ''Sekolah Tinggi Agama Islam Negeri'' or STAIN) across the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lukens-Bull|first1=R.|title=Islamic Higher Education in Indonesia: Continuity and Conflict|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137313416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BquAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT129|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"profil\">{{cite web|title=Profil Universitas|url=http://www.uin-malang.ac.id/s/uin/profil|publisher=UIN Malang|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=id}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 11 Tahun 1997 Tentang Pendirian Sekolah Tinggi Agama Islam Negeri|url=http://staincurup.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Kepres-Pendirian-STAIN-No-11-Th-1997.pdf|website=STAIN Curup|publisher=Government of Indonesia|accessdate=20 November 2017|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035301/http://staincurup.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Kepres-Pendirian-STAIN-No-11-Th-1997.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter its 1997 separation, the university was once more renamed to ''Universitas Islam Indonesia Sudan'' (Indonesian-Sudanese Islamic University) by vice president [[Hamzah Haz]] on 21 July 2002 as a result of a cooperation between Indonesia and [[Sudan]] \u2013 marking its transition to university status.

This changed on January 1, 2000, when the Rector UMB Library act of 2000 entered into force, this connected the decentralized libraries of the faculties into the \"Matej Bel University Library system.\n\n===International Partnership===\nCooperation of the University with other Universities and Institutions is widespread and involves many national and international organizations e.g.  [[The London School of Economics]] in UK,  [[University of Bologna]] in Italy,  [[Waseda University]] in Japan,  [[Moscow State University]] in Russia,  [[Sogang University]] in South Korea,  [[Indiana University]] in USA, etc.\nToday, Matej Bel University has 35 partnerships worldwide, apart from these agreements, the faculties have also signed agreements on cooperation based on the specific needs of their own, or their departments, totaling the number of partnerships to more than 80.\n\n==Culture and student life==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}\n\n{{AlumniStart}}\n{{Alum\n|name=[[Pavol Hurajt]] \n|year=\n|nota=[[Biathlete]]; [[2010 Winter Olympics]] - bronze medal\n|ref=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umb.sk/umb/umbbb.nsf/page/Oceneni_absolventi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160627/http://www.umb.sk/umb/umbbb.nsf/page/Oceneni_absolventi |archivedate=2012-10-28 }}</ref>}}\n{{Alum\n|name=\u013dubom\u00edr Dobr\u00edk\n|year=\n|nota= [[Justice]] of the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia]]\n|ref=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osobnosti.sk/index.php?os=zivotopis&ID=1055 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509094459/http://osobnosti.sk/index.php?os=zivotopis&ID=1055 |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}</ref>}}\n{{Alum\n|name=[[Government of Slovakia|J\u00e1n Richter]]\n|year= Mgr. - 2004\n|nota= [[Politician]] - Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of Slovakia\n|ref=<ref>http://komentare.sme.sk/c/6359500/fiktivny-bakalar.html</ref>}}\n{{Alum\n|name= [[Monika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1-Be\u0148ov\u00e1]]\n|year= PhDr. - 2007\n|nota= [[Politician]] - Member of the [[European Parliament]]\n|ref=<ref>http://monikaflasikovabenova.sk/sk/obsah/o-mne</ref>}}\n{{Alum\n|name= [[Peter Pellegrini]]\n|year= \n|nota= [[Politician]] - Prime minister of the Slovak Republic\n|ref=}}\n{{Alum\n|name= [[Adriana Ku\u010derov\u00e1]]\n|year= ?\n|nota= Soprano; studied at Matej Bel to be a teacher\n|ref=<ref name=Kuznik>Kuznik, Frank. \"[http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/stage/387-mozart-pure-and-clear.html Mozart, pure and clear] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018185500/http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/stage/387-mozart-pure-and-clear.html |date=2012-10-18 }}.\" ''[[The Prague Post]]''.

{"title_page": "Master of Architecture", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nThe '''Master of Architecture''' (M.Arch.) is a [[professional degree]] in [[architecture]], qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation ([[Intern architect|internship]], exams) that result in receiving a license.\n\n==Overview==\nThe degree is earned through several possible paths of study, depending on both a particular program's construction, and the candidate's previous academic experience and degrees.  M.Arch. degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as \"M.Arch. I\" and \"M.Arch. II\" to distinguish them.  All M.Arch. degrees are professional degrees in architecture.  There are, however, other master's degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.\n\nMany schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education.  Including study at the bachelor's and master's level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.\n\n* One possible route is what is commonly referred to as the \"4+2\" course.  This path entails completing a four-year, accredited, pre-professional bachelor of arts in architecture or a bachelor of science in architecture. This degree is not 3-year, depending on the nature and quality of your undergraduate study performance, and the evaluation of your master's degree program school of your undergraduate study) Master of Architecture program.  This route offers several advantages: your first four years are a bit more loose, allowing the inclusion of some liberal arts study; you can attend two different institutions for your undergraduate and graduate study, which is helpful in that it allows you to have a more varied architectural education, and you can pick the best place for you to complete your thesis (because chances are, you might not pick the program that has the exact focus that you will want when it becomes time for your thesis study); and you will finish the 4+2 course of study with a master's degree that will provide you the career option of teaching architecture at the collegiate level.\n* The second route to obtaining an accredited master's degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5-year master's degree (commonly called an \"M.Arch. I\").  The advantage to this route is that the student can study something else he or she is interested in his/her undergraduate study (anything else).  Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch. I program is often considered an advantage.  One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree).  Another disadvantage is that the student has a very short time to cover the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge.  Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including [[MIT]] and [[Harvard]] often offer a 3.5-year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.\n* A third possible route is what schools are calling a \"post-professional\" master's degree. It is research-based and often a stepping-stone to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Architecture. Schools include [[Cornell]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[MIT]], and [[RISD]].<ref>{{cite web|last=For instance see: Cornell|title=Post-Professional Master of Architecture Program|url=http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/programs/marchpost.cfm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Harvard|title=Programs|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/architecture/march-ii.html}}</ref>\n\nIt is worth noting that there is another route to becoming an architect: the continuous 5-year professional degree program.  In such a program, after five years of study, students are awarded with a professional degree in architecture. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) or an M.Arch.  In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch.  Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the [[Architectural Registration Exam]], the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect's license in the U.S..  One disadvantage of the B.Arch. degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions).  Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch. choose to pursue a 3-semester master's degree (not an M.Arch.) to obtain further academic qualification.\n\nGraduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, [[building science]], [[structural engineering]], [[architectural history]], theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or [[digital media]]. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.\n\nImportant to consider in choosing the school(s) for an architectural education is their overall \"focus\". Architectural schools usually, by virtue of the history of the school and the interests of the faculty, will approach the instruction of architecture from a technical, historical, or artistic bent\u2014or a combination thereof. This is not something that will be spelled out in the school's literature, but will be more or less apparent in the lists of classes offered and the study areas of the faculty. While it may not seem important at first, in retrospect it will probably be a major factor.\n\nAn architectural thesis is the culmination of a student's research.  Submission of the thesis represents the completion of the final requirement for the degree and may be presented as graphic representations, a written work, or physical forms.  According to ''Architectural Research Methods''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21Uz_E0HNR4C& Architectural Research Methods]. Linda N. Groat, David Wang. John Wiley and Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|0-471-33365-4}}</ref> by Linda N. Groat and David Wang, the scope of the research inquiry must not be too broad or too narrow.  A good topic will clearly and simply identify a body of literature to which the topical question can be referred.  Additionally, a thesis question must have significance to not only the student, but his or her peers, and to the field of architecture.\n\nIn the [[United States]], The [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from a NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture.\n\nAgain, first time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch. degree can also qualify for registration, without obtaining a master's degree.  Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they are earning their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.\n\nIn Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the [[Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the [[Examination for Architects in Canada]] (ExAC).\n\nAs of March 2006, there were eighty-four accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico. In Canada, there were ten accredited programs.\n\n==Master's degree programs==\n\n===United States===\nColleges and universities in the [[United States]] with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below.\n\n:''Note: '' Schools where a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] can also be earned are marked with *\n\n*[[Academy of Art University]]*, School of Architecture, [http://www.academyart.edu/architecture-school/index.html] [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]\n*[[Andrews University]], School of Architecture, Art & Design, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207184320/http://www.andrews.edu/arch/] [[Berrien Springs, Michigan]]\n*[[Arizona State University]] School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (SALA), [https://web.archive.org/web/20060331095330/http://www.asu.edu/caed/sala/program/graduate/index.htm] [[Tempe, Arizona]]\n*[[Ball State University]]*, [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning]], Department of Architecture, [http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CollegesandDepartments/CAP/Programs/Architecture.aspx] [[Muncie, Indiana]]\n*[[Boston Architectural College]]* [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n*[[California College of the Arts]]*, Department of Architecture, [http://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/march/] [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]\n*[[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]], Department of Architecture, [https://web.archive.org/web/19981201081103/http://www.csupomona.edu/%7Earc/] [[Pomona, California]]\n*[[The Catholic University of America]], School of Architecture and Planning, [http://architecture.cua.edu/] [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Clemson University]], School of Architecture, [http://www.clemson.edu/caah/architecture/] [[Clemson, South Carolina]]\n*[[City College of the City University of New York]]*, school of architecture, urban design and landscape architecture [http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/architecture/] [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n*[[Columbia University]], Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), [http://www.arch.columbia.edu/] [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n*[[Cooper Union]]*, The Irwin S.

M.Arch. degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as \"M.Arch. I\" and \"M.Arch. II\" to distinguish them.  All M.Arch. degrees are professional degrees in architecture.  There are, however, other master's degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.\n\nMany schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education.  Including study at the bachelor's and master's level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.\n\n* One possible route is what is commonly referred to as the \"4+2\" course.  This path entails completing a four-year, accredited, pre-professional bachelor of arts in architecture or a bachelor of science in architecture. This degree is not 3-year, depending on the nature and quality of your undergraduate study performance, and the evaluation of your master's degree program school of your undergraduate study) Master of Architecture program.  This route offers several advantages: your first four years are a bit more loose, allowing the inclusion of some liberal arts study; you can attend two different institutions for your undergraduate and graduate study, which is helpful in that it allows you to have a more varied architectural education, and you can pick the best place for you to complete your thesis (because chances are, you might not pick the program that has the exact focus that you will want when it becomes time for your thesis study); and you will finish the 4+2 course of study with a master's degree that will provide you the career option of teaching architecture at the collegiate level.\n* The second route to obtaining an accredited master's degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5-year master's degree (commonly called an \"M.Arch. I\").  The advantage to this route is that the student can study something else he or she is interested in his/her undergraduate study (anything else).  Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch. I program is often considered an advantage.  One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree).  Another disadvantage is that the student has a very short time to cover the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge.  Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including [[MIT]] and [[Harvard]] often offer a 3.5-year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.\n* A third possible route is what schools are calling a \"post-professional\" master's degree. It is research-based and often a stepping-stone to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Architecture. Schools include [[Cornell]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[MIT]], and [[RISD]].<ref>{{cite web|last=For instance see: Cornell|title=Post-Professional Master of Architecture Program|url=http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/programs/marchpost.cfm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Harvard|title=Programs|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/architecture/march-ii.html}}</ref>\n\nIt is worth noting that there is another route to becoming an architect: the continuous 5-year professional degree program.  In such a program, after five years of study, students are awarded with a professional degree in architecture. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) or an M.Arch.  In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch.  Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the [[Architectural Registration Exam]], the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect's license in the U.S..  One disadvantage of the B.Arch. degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions).  Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch. choose to pursue a 3-semester master's degree (not an M.Arch.) to obtain further academic qualification.\n\nGraduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, [[building science]], [[structural engineering]], [[architectural history]], theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or [[digital media]]. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.\n\nImportant to consider in choosing the school(s) for an architectural education is their overall \"focus\". Architectural schools usually, by virtue of the history of the school and the interests of the faculty, will approach the instruction of architecture from a technical, historical, or artistic bent\u2014or a combination thereof. This is not something that will be spelled out in the school's literature, but will be more or less apparent in the lists of classes offered and the study areas of the faculty. While it may not seem important at first, in retrospect it will probably be a major factor.\n\nAn architectural thesis is the culmination of a student's research.  Submission of the thesis represents the completion of the final requirement for the degree and may be presented as graphic representations, a written work, or physical forms.  According to ''Architectural Research Methods''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=21Uz_E0HNR4C& Architectural Research Methods]. Linda N. Groat, David Wang. John Wiley and Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|0-471-33365-4}}</ref> by Linda N. Groat and David Wang, the scope of the research inquiry must not be too broad or too narrow.  A good topic will clearly and simply identify a body of literature to which the topical question can be referred.  Additionally, a thesis question must have significance to not only the student, but his or her peers, and to the field of architecture.\n\nIn the [[United States]], The [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from a NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture.\n\nAgain, first time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch. degree can also qualify for registration, without obtaining a master's degree.  Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they are earning their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.\n\nIn Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the [[Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the [[Examination for Architects in Canada]] (ExAC).\n\nAs of March 2006, there were eighty-four accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico. In Canada, there were ten accredited programs.\n\n==Master's degree programs==\n\n===United States===\nColleges and universities in the [[United States]] with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below.\n\n:''Note: '' Schools where a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] can also be earned are marked with *\n\n*[[Academy of Art University]]*, School of Architecture, [http://www.academyart.edu/architecture-school/index.html] [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]\n*[[Andrews University]], School of Architecture, Art & Design, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207184320/http://www.andrews.edu/arch/] [[Berrien Springs, Michigan]]\n*[[Arizona State University]] School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (SALA), [https://web.archive.org/web/20060331095330/http://www.asu.edu/caed/sala/program/graduate/index.htm] [[Tempe, Arizona]]\n*[[Ball State University]]*, [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning]], Department of Architecture, [http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CollegesandDepartments/CAP/Programs/Architecture.aspx] [[Muncie, Indiana]]\n*[[Boston Architectural College]]* [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n*[[California College of the Arts]]*, Department of Architecture, [http://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/march/] [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]\n*[[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]], Department of Architecture, [https://web.archive.org/web/19981201081103/http://www.csupomona.edu/%7Earc/] [[Pomona, California]]\n*[[The Catholic University of America]], School of Architecture and Planning, [http://architecture.cua.edu/] [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Clemson University]], School of Architecture, [http://www.clemson.edu/caah/architecture/] [[Clemson, South Carolina]]\n*[[City College of the City University of New York]]*, school of architecture, urban design and landscape architecture [http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/architecture/] [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n*[[Columbia University]], Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), [http://www.arch.columbia.edu/] [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n*[[Cooper Union]]*, The Irwin S.

It drew from the agriculture departments of Victoria University College in Wellington and Auckland University College.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 1927 the college was renamed ''Massey Agricultural College'' after former New Zealand [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[William Massey|William Fergusson Massey]], who died in 1925 and had been vigorous in land reform efforts. The Massey Agricultural College Committee first met on 1 February 1927, and the Batchelar property, near the present Turitea site, was purchased that June. The college was officially opened for tuition on 20 March 1928 by O. J.

In 1963 this branch amalgamated with Massey College to form ''Massey University College of Manawatu'', and on 25 September, the Massey University Act 1963 made it an independent university as ''Massey University of Manawatu'', with its present name being adopted in 1966.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInaugurated in 1993, classes began at Massey's Albany campus in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/history-of-massey-university/1993---2009/1993---2009_home.cfm |title=Expanding into three cities (1993\u20132009) \u2013 Massey University |publisher=Massey.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010 Massey announced that the Wellington campus would close its School of Engineering and Advanced Technology the next month.

While outlining changes that were being made to the structure of the University's veterinarian and agricultural degrees, Kelly said that more women passed the first year of the veterinarian degree \"because women mature earlier than men, work hard and pass. Whereas men find out about booze and all sorts of crazy things during their first year...

It drew from the agriculture departments of Victoria University College in Wellington and Auckland University College.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 1927 the college was renamed ''Massey Agricultural College'' after former New Zealand [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[William Massey|William Fergusson Massey]], who died in 1925 and had been vigorous in land reform efforts. The Massey Agricultural College Committee first met on 1 February 1927, and the Batchelar property, near the present Turitea site, was purchased that June. The college was officially opened for tuition on 20 March 1928 by O. J. Hawkin.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  Women were admitted from 1932, with Enid Hills being the first.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/7102464/First-woman-at-Massey-dies |title=First woman at Massey dies \u2013 education \u2013 national |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the demise of the UNZ in 1961, it became ''Massey College'', part of [[Victoria University of Wellington]] (VUW). In 1960 a branch of VUW was established in Palmerston North to teach students by [[distance education]], known as extramural study. In 1963 this branch amalgamated with Massey College to form ''Massey University College of Manawatu'', and on 25 September, the Massey University Act 1963 made it an independent university as ''Massey University of Manawatu'', with its present name being adopted in 1966.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInaugurated in 1993, classes began at Massey's Albany campus in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/history-of-massey-university/1993---2009/1993---2009_home.cfm |title=Expanding into three cities (1993\u20132009) \u2013 Massey University |publisher=Massey.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010 Massey announced that the Wellington campus would close its School of Engineering and Advanced Technology the next month.

However, as [[Jean-Yves Camus]] and [[Nicolas Lebourg]] point out, this leaning had only a few in common with the \"[[European New Right]]\" that had been emerging since the 1960s, more inspired by the [[Conservative Revolution|conservative revolutionary]] [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck|Moeller van den Bruck]] than by the [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[Adam Smith]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|last=Camus|first=Jean-Yves|last2=Lebourg|first2=Nicolas|date=2017-03-20|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674971530|location=|pages=122|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==New Right by country==\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], \"the New Right\" refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] which advocates [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and increased [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies (as opposed to the \"old right\" which advocated [[Economic conservatism|economically conservative]] policies and \"[[small-l liberal]]s\" with more [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] views).<ref>Verity Archer,  \"Dole bludgers, tax payers and the New Right: Constructing discourses of welfare in 1970s Australia.\" ''Labour History''  96 (2009): 177\u2013190.</ref>  Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the [[Australian Labor Party]] initiate [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to \"New Right\" ideology. After the [[John Howard]] Coalition ended the 13-year rule of the [[Hawke\u2013Keating Government|Hawke-Keating]] Labor government at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]], economic reforms were taken further, some examples being wholesale labor market deregulation (e.g. [[WorkChoices]]), the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly [[Telstra]], and sweeping [[welfare reform]] including \"[[work for the dole]]\".

Hinzpeter's introduction of the term caused a buzz among newspapers, politicians and analysts. According to a column published in ''[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]]'', the New Right is different from the old [[military dictatorship|dictatorial]] right of [[Augusto Pinochet]], in the sense that it embraces democracy. It is also different from the religiously conservative [[Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]] party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like [[divorce]]. According to the same analysis, the New Right is becoming increasingly pragmatic, as shown by their decision to increase taxes following the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]].<ref>Marcelo Pollack, ''New Right in Chile'' (Springer, 1999).</ref>\n\n===France===\n\nIn [[France]], the New Right (or ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'') has been used as a term to describe a modern think-tank of French political philosophers and intellectuals led by [[Alain de Benoist]]. Another noted intellectual, who was once part of Alain de Benoist's GRECE, is [[Guillaume Faye]]. Although accused by some critics as being \"[[far-right]]\" in their beliefs, they themselves claim that their ideas transcend the traditional [[left\u2013right politics|left\u2013right divide]] and actively encourages free debate.

The party advocates the preservation of a strong right-wing in Israel.\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe [[New Right (Netherlands)|New Right]] (NR) was the name of a far-right/nationalist political party in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2007.  The [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by [[Geert Wilders]], also is a New Right movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gerard Delanty|title=Identity, Belonging and Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rMgCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA262|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=262|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781846314537}}</ref> Since March 2017 [[Forum voor Democratie]] is another new right party in the Dutch parliament.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn [[New Zealand]], as in Australia, it was the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] that initially adopted \"New Right\" economic policies. \"[[Rogernomics]]\" involved [[monetarism|monetarist]] approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]], while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as \"New Right\" middle-class voters voted Labour at the [[1987 New Zealand general election]] in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] administration and privatised them altogether during Labour's second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of [[Jim Anderton]] and his [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]], which later formed part of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]] with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.<ref>Michael Peters,  and James Marshall. \"Education, the new right and the crisis of the welfare state in New Zealand.\" ''Australian Journal of Education Studies'' 11.1 (1990): 77\u201390.</ref>\n\nHowever, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party's second term in office, the Opposition [[New Zealand National Party]] (popularly known as 'National') selected [[Ruth Richardson]] as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 general election]], Richardson became Minister of Finance, while [[Jenny Shipley]] became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce \"[[welfare dependency]]\" \u2013 both core New Right policy initiatives.\n\nIn the early nineties, maverick National Party MP [[Winston Peters]] also came to oppose New Right economic policies, and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his [[New Zealand First]] anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996\u201398) and Labour (2005\u201308 and 2017-ongoing). Due to the introduction of the [[Electoral system of New Zealand|MMP]] electoral system, a New Right \"Association of Consumers and Taxpayers\" party, known as [[ACT New Zealand]], was formed by ex-Labour New Right-aligned Cabinet Ministers like [[Richard Prebble]] and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing US-style \"[[welfare reform]].\" ACT New Zealand aspired to become National's centre-right coalition partner, but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often lacked strategic direction.\n\nAs for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when [[Helen Clark]] led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999\u20132002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002. National was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First's partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When [[Bill English]] became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When [[Don Brash]] became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National's fold, causing National's revival in fortunes at the [[2005 New Zealand general election]]. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT's survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by [[John Key]], who was a more moderate National MP.\n\nAs for the centre-left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour's repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and [[Labour market flexibility|labour market deregulation]] and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by [[Tony Blair]] and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.<ref>Roger Dale,  \"National reform, economic crisis and \u2018New Right\u2019theory: A New Zealand perspective.\" ''Discourse'' 14.2 (1994): 17\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], a [[conservative libertarian]]<ref name=\"SZN\">{{cite news|title=Leader of Poland\u2019s Euro-sceptic party believes: \"Women should not have right to vote.\"|url=http://sz-n.com/2014/04/leader-of-polands-euro-sceptic-party-believes-women-should-not-have-right-to-vote/|date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Szczerbiak\">{{cite news|title=EU election: Polish campaign dominated by Ukraine crisis|author=Aleks Szczerbiak|url=http://theconversation.com/eu-election-polish-campaign-dominated-by-ukraine-crisis-25782|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/20/uk-eu-parliament-eurosceptics-idUKKCN0I920W20141020|title=UKIP, 5-Star welcome Polish radical to save EU voting bloc|newspaper=Reuters|date=20 October 2014|first=Alastair|last=Macdonald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/17/world/social-issues-world/polish-meps-racial-slur-remark-sparks-anger/#.ViUt9ePouUl|title=Polish MEP's racial slur sparks anger|work=The Japan Times|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> and [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] political party [[Congress of the New Right]] (New Right) was founded on 25 March 2011 from former political parties [[Freedom and Lawfulness]] (WiP) and [[Real Politics Union]] (UPR) by [[Janusz Korwin-Mikke]].

However, as [[Jean-Yves Camus]] and [[Nicolas Lebourg]] point out, this leaning had only a few in common with the \"[[European New Right]]\" that had been emerging since the 1960s, more inspired by the [[Conservative Revolution|conservative revolutionary]] [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck|Moeller van den Bruck]] than by the [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[Adam Smith]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|last=Camus|first=Jean-Yves|last2=Lebourg|first2=Nicolas|date=2017-03-20|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674971530|location=|pages=122|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==New Right by country==\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], \"the New Right\" refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] which advocates [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and increased [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies (as opposed to the \"old right\" which advocated [[Economic conservatism|economically conservative]] policies and \"[[small-l liberal]]s\" with more [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] views).<ref>Verity Archer,  \"Dole bludgers, tax payers and the New Right: Constructing discourses of welfare in 1970s Australia.\" ''Labour History''  96 (2009): 177\u2013190.</ref>  Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the [[Australian Labor Party]] initiate [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to \"New Right\" ideology.

It is also different from the religiously conservative [[Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]] party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like [[divorce]].

The [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by [[Geert Wilders]], also is a New Right movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gerard Delanty|title=Identity, Belonging and Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rMgCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA262|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=262|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781846314537}}</ref> Since March 2017 [[Forum voor Democratie]] is another new right party in the Dutch parliament.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn [[New Zealand]], as in Australia, it was the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] that initially adopted \"New Right\" economic policies. \"[[Rogernomics]]\" involved [[monetarism|monetarist]] approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]], while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as \"New Right\" middle-class voters voted Labour at the [[1987 New Zealand general election]] in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] administration and privatised them altogether during Labour's second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of [[Jim Anderton]] and his [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]], which later formed part of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]] with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.<ref>Michael Peters,  and James Marshall. \"Education, the new right and the crisis of the welfare state in New Zealand.\" ''Australian Journal of Education Studies'' 11.1 (1990): 77\u201390.</ref>\n\nHowever, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party's second term in office, the Opposition [[New Zealand National Party]] (popularly known as 'National') selected [[Ruth Richardson]] as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 general election]], Richardson became Minister of Finance, while [[Jenny Shipley]] became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce \"[[welfare dependency]]\" \u2013 both core New Right policy initiatives.\n\nIn the early nineties, maverick National Party MP [[Winston Peters]] also came to oppose New Right economic policies, and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his [[New Zealand First]] anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996\u201398) and Labour (2005\u201308 and 2017-ongoing). Due to the introduction of the [[Electoral system of New Zealand|MMP]] electoral system, a New Right \"Association of Consumers and Taxpayers\" party, known as [[ACT New Zealand]], was formed by ex-Labour New Right-aligned Cabinet Ministers like [[Richard Prebble]] and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing US-style \"[[welfare reform]].\" ACT New Zealand aspired to become National's centre-right coalition partner, but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often lacked strategic direction.\n\nAs for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when [[Helen Clark]] led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999\u20132002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002. National was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First's partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When [[Bill English]] became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When [[Don Brash]] became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National's fold, causing National's revival in fortunes at the [[2005 New Zealand general election]]. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT's survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by [[John Key]], who was a more moderate National MP.\n\nAs for the centre-left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour's repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and [[Labour market flexibility|labour market deregulation]] and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by [[Tony Blair]] and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.<ref>Roger Dale,  \"National reform, economic crisis and \u2018New Right\u2019theory: A New Zealand perspective.\" ''Discourse'' 14.2 (1994): 17\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], a [[conservative libertarian]]<ref name=\"SZN\">{{cite news|title=Leader of Poland\u2019s Euro-sceptic party believes: \"Women should not have right to vote.\"|url=http://sz-n.com/2014/04/leader-of-polands-euro-sceptic-party-believes-women-should-not-have-right-to-vote/|date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Szczerbiak\">{{cite news|title=EU election: Polish campaign dominated by Ukraine crisis|author=Aleks Szczerbiak|url=http://theconversation.com/eu-election-polish-campaign-dominated-by-ukraine-crisis-25782|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/20/uk-eu-parliament-eurosceptics-idUKKCN0I920W20141020|title=UKIP, 5-Star welcome Polish radical to save EU voting bloc|newspaper=Reuters|date=20 October 2014|first=Alastair|last=Macdonald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/17/world/social-issues-world/polish-meps-racial-slur-remark-sparks-anger/#.ViUt9ePouUl|title=Polish MEP's racial slur sparks anger|work=The Japan Times|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> and [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] political party [[Congress of the New Right]] (New Right) was founded on 25 March 2011 from former political parties [[Freedom and Lawfulness]] (WiP) and [[Real Politics Union]] (UPR) by [[Janusz Korwin-Mikke]].
