It is one of the three principal units tasked with [[special operations]] in the [[Netherlands]] (the others being the [[Korps Commandotroepen]] (KCT) of the [[Royal Netherlands Army]] and the [[Brigade Speciale Beveiligingsopdrachten]] (BSB) of the [[Royal Marechaussee]]). The unit can be deployed worldwide to conduct  [[special operations]], including [[counter-terrorism]] both overseas and domestically, with a maritime focus.\n\nThe unit was created in 2013 with the merger of the [[M-Squadron|Unit Interventie Mariniers]] (UIM) and the Maritime Special Operations (MSO)-[[Company (military unit)|company]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=van Oosbree |first1=Gerard |title=NLMARSOF: \u2018Het beste van drie werelden in een eenheid\u2019 |url=https://www.dutchdefencepress.com/nlmarsof-het-beste-van-drie-werelden-in-een-eenheid/ |publisher=Dutch Defence Press |date=2013-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUntil 2008, the Dutch maritime special forces capability consisted of three distinct units: the Dutch Frogmen Platoon, the Mountain Leader Reconnaissance Troop, and the [[M-Squadron|UIM]]. The Dutch Frogmen Platoon has historically had a strong connection with the [[UK]] [[Special Boat Service]], and was informally often named \"7th Troop SBS\". The Mountain Leader Reconnaissance Troop (ML Recce Troop), was established in 1990 and modeled after the [[Brigade Patrol Troop]] of the UK [[Royal Marines]]. The [[M-Squadron|Unit Interventie Mariniers]] (UIM), named Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid (Special Support Unit) until 2006, was formed on 22 February 1973, in response to a rising threat of terrorist attacks in both Europe and domestically. The main goal of this unit is the countering of large scale and/or complex domestic terrorist attacks. \n\nSince 2006 the operational command of UIM is executed by the [[Dienst Speciale Interventies]] of the [[Dutch National Police]]. In 2008, the Dutch Frogmen Platoon and the ML Recce Troop merged into the Maritime Special Operations Company (MSO-Coy) and were tasked with all amphibious operations for the Royal Netherlands Navy. While commencing in an informal manner in 2009, since 2013 NLMARSOF was officially established as a new operational unit. The MSO-Coy was renamed Conventional-Squadron (C-Squadron), and is tasked with the full spectrum of special operations outside of the  Netherlands. \n\nUIM was renamed Maritime-Squadron (M-Squadron), and is dedicated to national counter-terrorism missions under operational command of the DSI. Training-Squadron (T-Squadron) will support both M-Squadron and C-Squadron, and is responsible for all training and the recruitment of new operators.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraag |first1=Andy |title=Forging Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces |date=2012-06-01 |publisher=Naval Postgraduate School |location=Monterrey, California}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nNLMARSOF currently consists of three operational squadrons, and one dedicated operational support group:\n* Conventional Squadron (C-Squadron): Tasked with executing the full spectrum of special operations outside of the Netherlands, with an emphasis on long-range reconnaissance patrols. Consists of conventional operators, [[Mountain Leader]]s and [[Frogman|Frogmen]].\n* Maritime Counter-Terrorism Squadron ([[M-Squadron]]): Tasked with conducting domestic counter-terrorist operations under the command of the DSI. M-Squadron trains extensively on the neutralisation of complex terrorist attacks, for example on off-shore oil platforms.\n* Training Squadron (T-Squadron): Tasked with training of both C- and M-Squadron and the recruitment of new personnel within the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] ranks.\n* Special Operation Forces Support Group (SOFSG): Tasked with providing material and logistical support for all operations conducted by NLMARSOF.\n\n== Tasks ==\nNLMARSOF carries out four main types of operations:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marg\u00e9s |first1=Joost |title=MARSOF niet voor niets op Malta: Trojan Footprint mixt oefening met ware wereld |journal=Alle Hens |date=2016-05-23 |url=https://magazines.defensie.nl/allehens/2016/05/04_trojan-footprint}}</ref>\n* [[Direct Action]] (DA): Conducting small-scale offensive operations such as raids, ambushes and sabotage.\n* [[Military aid|Military Assistance]] (MA): Supplying military support to foreign military units. This support can consist of both providing training and providing assistance during actual operations.\n* [[Special Reconnaissance]] (SR): Conducting special reconnaissance behind enemy lines, for example monitoring hostile troop movements, while avoiding direct contact with the enemy.\n* [[Counter-terrorism]] (CT): Conducting both national and international counter terror operations, where NLMARSOF, compared to its army counterpart [[Korps Commandotroepen]], emphasises training for operations in a maritime setting.\n\n== Recruitment and training == \nAll new personnel for NLMARSOF is recruited from within the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] ranks, there is no possibility for civilians or military personnel from other branches to join NLMARSOF.\n\nThe training starts with a three-week pre-selection course, the Aptitude. Recruits must endure this pre-selection to qualify for the twenty-week MSOF-course, which will transform the recruits into NLMARSOF-operators. After the MSOF-course, all recruits must complete the fourteen-week Nationale Interventie Opleiding (National Intervention Course), which focuses on domestic counter-terrorist scenarios. The operators that have completed both of these courses are then fully operational to serve in M-Squadron. Operators bound for C-Squadron will have to complete the Mountain Leader or the twelve-week Frogmen course to obtain operational status within C-Squadron.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Twigt |first1=Andr\u00e9 |title=De lat ligt gewoon hoog |journal=Alle Hens |date=2018-12-09 |url=https://magazines.defensie.nl/allehens/2018/01/05_kikkers-marsof}}</ref>\n\n== Units ==\n==== M-Squadron ====\nM-Squadron was founded as the Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid (BBE, Special Support Unit) in 1972 and was the first dedicated counter-terrorism unit in the Netherlands. Its establishment was deemed necessary after a rise of the terrorist threat level in Europe, such as [[the Munich Massacre]], and domestically, such as the terrorist attacks committed by [[Moluccans]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=van Oosbree |first1=Gerard |title=Unit Interventie Mariniers |url=https://www.dutchdefencepress.com/unit-interventie-mariniers/ |publisher=Dutch Defence Press |date=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n\nDomestic operations conducted by M-Squadron take place under the command of the [[Dienst Speciale Interventies]] (DSI) of the [[Dutch National Police]] since 2006. While the operational command resides with the DSI, M-Squadron continues to be an organisational unit of NLMARSOF and the Netherlands Marine Corps.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timmer |first1=Jaap |title=Krijgsmacht en politietaken |journal=Justiti\u00eble verkenningen |date=2018 |pages=79 |url=https://www.wodc.nl/binaries/JV201803_Volledige%20tekst_tcm28-335093.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==== C-Squadron ====\nC-Squadron conducts operations outside of the Netherlands and consists of regular NLMARSOF-operators that have completed the MSOF- and NIO-training, and operators that have completed the additional [[Mountain Leader]] and/or [[Frogmen]] training. \n\n* The Mountain Leader troop consists of operators who have successfully completed the nine-month training provided by the [[Mountain Leader Training Cadre]] of the [[3 Commando Brigade]] of the [[UK]] [[Royal Marines]]. This intense course, which partly takes place in northern [[Norway]], trains the aspiring operators in conducting operations in high altitude and arctic environments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mountain Leader Troops MARSOF |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWlskkIVHdI |website=www.youtube.com |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)]]}}</ref>\n* The Frogmen troop consists of operators that have successfully completed the twenty-three-week Kikvorsman (Frogman) course which is provided by the Defensie Duikgroep (Defence Diving Group). During this course, the aspiring frogmen receive extensive training on conducting underwater assaults, reconnaissance, demolition and operating from one of the [[Walrus-class submarine]]s of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=van Oosbree |first1=Gerard |title=De kikkeropleiding, heimelijk leren opereren op de grens van land en water |url=https://www.dutchdefencepress.com/de-kikkeropleiding-heimelijk-leren-opereren-op-de-grens-van-land-en-water/ |publisher=Dutch Defence Press |date=2016-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nSince its establishment M-Squadron, and its predecessors BBE and UIM, and C-Squadron, and its predecessor MSO-Company, have conducted various famous operations.

The unit can be deployed worldwide to conduct  [[special operations]], including [[counter-terrorism]] both overseas and domestically, with a maritime focus.\n\nThe unit was created in 2013 with the merger of the [[M-Squadron|Unit Interventie Mariniers]] (UIM) and the Maritime Special Operations (MSO)-[[Company (military unit)|company]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=van Oosbree |first1=Gerard |title=NLMARSOF: \u2018Het beste van drie werelden in een eenheid\u2019 |url=https://www.dutchdefencepress.com/nlmarsof-het-beste-van-drie-werelden-in-een-eenheid/ |publisher=Dutch Defence Press |date=2013-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUntil 2008, the Dutch maritime special forces capability consisted of three distinct units: the Dutch Frogmen Platoon, the Mountain Leader Reconnaissance Troop, and the [[M-Squadron|UIM]]. The Dutch Frogmen Platoon has historically had a strong connection with the [[UK]] [[Special Boat Service]], and was informally often named \"7th Troop SBS\". The Mountain Leader Reconnaissance Troop (ML Recce Troop), was established in 1990 and modeled after the [[Brigade Patrol Troop]] of the UK [[Royal Marines]]. The [[M-Squadron|Unit Interventie Mariniers]] (UIM), named Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid (Special Support Unit) until 2006, was formed on 22 February 1973, in response to a rising threat of terrorist attacks in both Europe and domestically. The main goal of this unit is the countering of large scale and/or complex domestic terrorist attacks. \n\nSince 2006 the operational command of UIM is executed by the [[Dienst Speciale Interventies]] of the [[Dutch National Police]]. In 2008, the Dutch Frogmen Platoon and the ML Recce Troop merged into the Maritime Special Operations Company (MSO-Coy) and were tasked with all amphibious operations for the Royal Netherlands Navy. While commencing in an informal manner in 2009, since 2013 NLMARSOF was officially established as a new operational unit. The MSO-Coy was renamed Conventional-Squadron (C-Squadron), and is tasked with the full spectrum of special operations outside of the  Netherlands. \n\nUIM was renamed Maritime-Squadron (M-Squadron), and is dedicated to national counter-terrorism missions under operational command of the DSI. Training-Squadron (T-Squadron) will support both M-Squadron and C-Squadron, and is responsible for all training and the recruitment of new operators.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraag |first1=Andy |title=Forging Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces |date=2012-06-01 |publisher=Naval Postgraduate School |location=Monterrey, California}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n* Conventional Squadron (C-Squadron): Tasked with executing the full spectrum of special operations outside of the Netherlands, with an emphasis on long-range reconnaissance patrols. Consists of conventional operators, [[Mountain Leader]]s and [[Frogman|Frogmen]].\n* Maritime Counter-Terrorism Squadron ([[M-Squadron]]): Tasked with conducting domestic counter-terrorist operations under the command of the DSI. M-Squadron trains extensively on the neutralisation of complex terrorist attacks, for example on off-shore oil platforms.\n* Training Squadron (T-Squadron): Tasked with training of both C- and M-Squadron and the recruitment of new personnel within the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] ranks.\n* Special Operation Forces Support Group (SOFSG): Tasked with providing material and logistical support for all operations conducted by NLMARSOF.\n\n== Tasks ==\nNLMARSOF carries out four main types of operations:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marg\u00e9s |first1=Joost |title=MARSOF niet voor niets op Malta: Trojan Footprint mixt oefening met ware wereld |journal=Alle Hens |date=2016-05-23 |url=https://magazines.defensie.nl/allehens/2016/05/04_trojan-footprint}}</ref>\n* [[Direct Action]] (DA): Conducting small-scale offensive operations such as raids, ambushes and sabotage.\n* [[Military aid|Military Assistance]] (MA): Supplying military support to foreign military units. This support can consist of both providing training and providing assistance during actual operations.\n* [[Special Reconnaissance]] (SR): Conducting special reconnaissance behind enemy lines, for example monitoring hostile troop movements, while avoiding direct contact with the enemy.\n* [[Counter-terrorism]] (CT): Conducting both national and international counter terror operations, where NLMARSOF, compared to its army counterpart [[Korps Commandotroepen]], emphasises training for operations in a maritime setting.\n\n== Recruitment and training == \nAll new personnel for NLMARSOF is recruited from within the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] ranks, there is no possibility for civilians or military personnel from other branches to join NLMARSOF.\n\nThe training starts with a three-week pre-selection course, the Aptitude. Recruits must endure this pre-selection to qualify for the twenty-week MSOF-course, which will transform the recruits into NLMARSOF-operators. After the MSOF-course, all recruits must complete the fourteen-week Nationale Interventie Opleiding (National Intervention Course), which focuses on domestic counter-terrorist scenarios. The operators that have completed both of these courses are then fully operational to serve in M-Squadron. Operators bound for C-Squadron will have to complete the Mountain Leader or the twelve-week Frogmen course to obtain operational status within C-Squadron.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Twigt |first1=Andr\u00e9 |title=De lat ligt gewoon hoog |journal=Alle Hens |date=2018-12-09 |url=https://magazines.defensie.nl/allehens/2018/01/05_kikkers-marsof}}</ref>\n\n== Units ==\n==== M-Squadron ====\nM-Squadron was founded as the Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid (BBE, Special Support Unit) in 1972 and was the first dedicated counter-terrorism unit in the Netherlands. Its establishment was deemed necessary after a rise of the terrorist threat level in Europe, such as [[the Munich Massacre]], and domestically, such as the terrorist attacks committed by [[Moluccans]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=van Oosbree |first1=Gerard |title=Unit Interventie Mariniers |url=https://www.dutchdefencepress.com/unit-interventie-mariniers/ |publisher=Dutch Defence Press |date=2012-03-17}}</ref>\n\nDomestic operations conducted by M-Squadron take place under the command of the [[Dienst Speciale Interventies]] (DSI) of the [[Dutch National Police]] since 2006. While the operational command resides with the DSI, M-Squadron continues to be an organisational unit of NLMARSOF and the Netherlands Marine Corps.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timmer |first1=Jaap |title=Krijgsmacht en politietaken |journal=Justiti\u00eble verkenningen |date=2018 |pages=79 |url=https://www.wodc.nl/binaries/JV201803_Volledige%20tekst_tcm28-335093.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSince its establishment M-Squadron, and its predecessors BBE and UIM, have conducted various famous operations.

The film, which was written by Segel and co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]], was released by [[Universal Pictures]]. Filming began in April 2007 at the [[Turtle Bay Resort]] on the North Shore of Oahu Island in Hawaii. The film was released for North American theaters on April 18, 2008 and in the UK a week later on April 25, 2008.\nThe story revolves around Peter Bretter, who is a music composer for a TV show that happens to feature his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, in the lead role. After a five-year relationship, Sarah abruptly breaks up with Peter. Devastated by this event, he chooses to go on a vacation in Hawaii, in order to try to move forward with his life. Trouble ensues when he runs into his ex on the island as she is vacationing with her new boyfriend.\n\n==Plot==\nComposer Peter Bretter ([[Jason Segel]]) is in a five-year relationship with actress Sarah Marshall ([[Kristen Bell]]), who stars in a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-like television show titled ''Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime''. One day, as Peter stands stark naked in their apartment, Sarah abruptly announces that she is breaking up with him. Devastated, and unable to banish his grief through one-night stands, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii and stays at Turtle Bay resort. However, the vacation is ruined when he learns that Sarah and her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow ([[Russell Brand]]) are also guests of the resort. Taking pity on him, hotel concierge Rachel Jansen ([[Mila Kunis]]) offers him an incredibly expensive suite for free in exchange for cleaning up the room himself.\n\nPeter begins spending time with Rachel and starts to develop feelings for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Sarah and Aldous begins to falter. Much of the discord is triggered by the news that Sarah's TV show has been canceled and that Aldous is about to embark on a world tour with his group, Infant Sorrow, for 18 months. During a day of surf and sand, Aldous and Peter run into each other and begin talking. Inadvertently, Aldous informs Peter that he and Sarah began having sex a full year before she broke up with Peter. When Peter confronts Sarah, she tells him she began feeling disconnected emotionally from him and she couldn't do anything to make their relationship work. Further exacerbating the situation is Sarah's obvious jealousy of the budding relationship between Peter and Rachel, while Peter (through observing Sarah's relationship with Aldous) begins to realize that his relationship with her wasn't as great as he remembered.\n\nSarah, Aldous, Peter, and Rachel later share an awkward dinner together.  After the dinner, Peter takes Rachel back to his hotel room and they begin to have sex. Sarah hears them through the wall and initiates sex with Aldous, moaning loudly for the benefit of the couple next door, and Rachel and Peter turn the situation into a competition and become even louder. When Aldous realizes Sarah is clearly putting on a performance to provoke a reaction from Peter, he pushes her off and tells her the trip was a mistake as she's clearly not over Peter. They bicker furiously, prompting Aldous to announce that the relationship is over and that he cheated on her with a housekeeper. The next day Peter encounters Aldous, and learns that he and Sarah have broken up and that he is flying back to England. Peter goes to Sarah's room to console her where she admits she still loves him and tries to rekindle their romance. The two start to engage in sexual activity, but Peter gets ambivalent feelings towards Sarah and cuts it off, realizing that he has become much happier with Rachel and berates Sarah for treating him badly in the first place. Peter immediately goes to Rachel to confess what happened, but she is hurt and demands that he leave and never contact her again. Before leaving, Peter takes down a naked picture of Rachel at a local bar and returns it to her, despite enduring a beat-down from the owner.\n\nHe flies back to Los Angeles and after a period of sadness and self-loathing, he begins working on his [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] puppet comedy-rock opera, ''A Taste for Love''. He sends an invitation to Rachel for the opening night performance. Although extremely hesitant at first, Rachel eventually decides to attend. After the successful performance, Rachel congratulates Peter and tells him she's looking into attending school in the area. She leaves so Peter can bask in the success of his show, but quickly returns to Peter's dressing room to tell him she misses him, where she finds him stark naked, just as he was when Sarah dumped him. The film ends as they embrace and kiss.  During the credits, Sarah is seen starring in a new television show titled ''Animal Instincts'' where she plays a character who can read animals' minds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Peter Bretter: A slobbish but well-meaning composer for the TV show ''Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime''.

The film, which was written by Segel and co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]], was released by [[Universal Pictures]]. Filming began in April 2007 at the [[Turtle Bay Resort]] on the North Shore of Oahu Island in Hawaii. The film was released for North American theaters on April 18, 2008 and in the UK a week later on April 25, 2008.\nThe story revolves around Peter Bretter, who is a music composer for a TV show that happens to feature his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, in the lead role. After a five-year relationship, Sarah abruptly breaks up with Peter. Devastated by this event, he chooses to go on a vacation in Hawaii, in order to try to move forward with his life. Trouble ensues when he runs into his ex on the island as she is vacationing with her new boyfriend.\n\n==Plot==\nComposer Peter Bretter ([[Jason Segel]]) is in a five-year relationship with actress Sarah Marshall ([[Kristen Bell]]), who stars in a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-like television show titled ''Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime''. One day, as Peter stands stark naked in their apartment, Sarah abruptly announces that she is breaking up with him. Devastated, and unable to banish his grief through one-night stands, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii and stays at Turtle Bay resort. However, the vacation is ruined when he learns that Sarah and her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow ([[Russell Brand]]) are also guests of the resort. Taking pity on him, hotel concierge Rachel Jansen ([[Mila Kunis]]) offers him an incredibly expensive suite for free in exchange for cleaning up the room himself.\n\nPeter begins spending time with Rachel and starts to develop feelings for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Sarah and Aldous begins to falter. Much of the discord is triggered by the news that Sarah's TV show has been canceled and that Aldous is about to embark on a world tour with his group, Infant Sorrow, for 18 months. During a day of surf and sand, Aldous and Peter run into each other and begin talking. Inadvertently, Aldous informs Peter that he and Sarah began having sex a full year before she broke up with Peter. When Peter confronts Sarah, she tells him she began feeling disconnected emotionally from him and she couldn't do anything to make their relationship work. Further exacerbating the situation is Sarah's obvious jealousy of the budding relationship between Peter and Rachel, while Peter (through observing Sarah's relationship with Aldous) begins to realize that his relationship with her wasn't as great as he remembered.\n\nSarah, Aldous, Peter, and Rachel later share an awkward dinner together.  After the dinner, Peter takes Rachel back to his hotel room and they begin to have sex. Sarah hears them through the wall and initiates sex with Aldous, moaning loudly for the benefit of the couple next door, and Rachel and Peter turn the situation into a competition and become even louder. When Aldous realizes Sarah is clearly putting on a performance to provoke a reaction from Peter, he pushes her off and tells her the trip was a mistake as she's clearly not over Peter. They bicker furiously, prompting Aldous to announce that the relationship is over and that he cheated on her with a housekeeper. The next day Peter encounters Aldous, and learns that he and Sarah have broken up and that he is flying back to England. Peter goes to Sarah's room to console her where she admits she still loves him and tries to rekindle their romance. The two start to engage in sexual activity, but Peter gets ambivalent feelings towards Sarah and cuts it off, realizing that he has become much happier with Rachel and berates Sarah for treating him badly in the first place. Peter immediately goes to Rachel to confess what happened, but she is hurt and demands that he leave and never contact her again. Before leaving, Peter takes down a naked picture of Rachel at a local bar and returns it to her, despite enduring a beat-down from the owner.\n\nHe flies back to Los Angeles and after a period of sadness and self-loathing, he begins working on his [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] puppet comedy-rock opera, ''A Taste for Love''. He sends an invitation to Rachel for the opening night performance. Although extremely hesitant at first, Rachel eventually decides to attend. After the successful performance, Rachel congratulates Peter and tells him she's looking into attending school in the area. She leaves so Peter can bask in the success of his show, but quickly returns to Peter's dressing room to tell him she misses him, where she finds him stark naked, just as he was when Sarah dumped him. The film ends as they embrace and kiss.  During the credits, Sarah is seen starring in a new television show titled ''Animal Instincts'' where she plays a character who can read animals' minds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Peter Bretter: A slobbish but well-meaning composer for the TV show ''Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime''.
