This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a right in lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property, which can be physically moved.

In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each type. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n* Corporeal heritable property (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*Incorporeal heritable property (eg: a lease, a liferent, a security, etc.)\n*Corporeal moveable property (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n* Incorporeal moveable property (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.) \n\n== Corporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== Corporeal Heritable Property (Land) ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== Corporeal Moveable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== Incorporeal Moveable Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n\n\nIntellectual property{{main|Scots intellectual property law}}\n[[Intellectual property]] (IP) in Scotland is governed mostly by [[statute]] and is governed on a UK wide level.

He served briefly in 1817 as the president of the [[University of Georgia]] before his death. \n\nBorn in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], Finley had graduated at the age of 15 from the [[Princeton University#History|College of New Jersey]] (later developed and renamed as [[Princeton University]]).\n\n==Early life==\nFinley was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], in 1772 to James Finley and his wife Ann Angrest. His father, James Finley, was born 1737 in [[Glasgow, Scotland]], where he was trained as a yarn merchant and where he became acquainted with Rev [[John Witherspoon]], then a pastor in the town of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] about six miles from Glasgow. His father immigrated from Scotland to [[New Jersey]] in 1769. His paternal grandparents were James Finley from Paisley, and Ann McDonald Finley.\n\n==Career==\nRobert Finley entered the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] at the age of 11 and graduated in 1787, at the age of 15, at a time when it served more as a boys' academy.<ref name=\"PHS\">Finding Aid to the Robert Finley Papers at the Presbyterian Historical Society http://www.history.pcusa.org/collections/findingaids/fa.cfm?record_id=368</ref> He taught at several places, including [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where many households held enslaved African Americans. Thousands of others worked on plantations outside the city. \n\nThe [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]] of [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] licensed Finley as a [[Minister of religion|minister]] in 1794.

He worked there from 1795 until his acceptance of the [[University of Georgia]] (UGA) presidency in July 1817.\n\nIn 1795, Dr. Robert Finley, re-established the private academy, known as the Basking Ridge Classical School, conducting classes first at the Presbyterian parsonage and then in a new frame school building erected near the church. In 1809, with enrollment expanding, Finley organized financing and construction of a new two-story brick building, prominently located in the center of the village of Basking Ridge ([[Brick Academy]]).\n\nBoys were drawn both from the local area and from more distant places, such as Virginia and New York City, to attend this private preparatory academy. Most were given a classical education in preparation to enter the [[Princeton University#History|College of New Jersey]] (later expanded and renamed as Princeton University). Students boarded with Dr. Finley and other local residents. Two buildings still standing near the Brick Academy were later used as dormitories.\n\n== American Colonization Society ==\nDr. Finley and [[Samuel John Mills]] helped organize the ''National Colonization Society of America'' and the [[American Colonization Society]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1816 and 1817. They solicited contributions from many contemporaries, including former students such as [[Charles Muir Campbell]]. \n\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) proposed to relocate free American blacks to a colony in West Africa. The Society gained support from both some [[abolitionists]] and slaveholders, for differing reasons. Free blacks faced discrimination in both the free states of the North, where slavery was abolished after the Revolution (in a gradual process in some places) and in the slave societies of the South. In the latter areas, free blacks were feared as being influential in disrupting slaves and leading slave rebellions. \n\nSome abolitionists believed that black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in [[Africa]] than in the [[United States]]. Also, if there were a colony available to them where they could be resettled, abolitionists hoped to gain more manumissions of slaves and eventually end the institution. African Americans gradually moved into positions in the government. The Republic of Liberia declared its independence on July 26, 1847. Between January 7, 1822, and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born American black people, and 3,198 [[Afro-Caribbeans]], relocated to the settlement. Pioneers suffered extremely high mortality rates in the early years from new tropical diseases and lack of sanitation and infrastructure.\n\nThe U.S. did not recognize Liberia's independence until February 5, 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], because of previous opposition by Southern Congressmen. After the South seceded, remaining legislators voted to recognize the republic. \n\nIn 1817, Finley fell ill while traveling south to assume his new position as president of the University of Georgia.

Their [[wing]]s are long and fairly broad, suitable for soaring flight, with the outer four to six  primary feathers emarginated.\n\nThey have strong legs and feet with raptorial [[claw]]s and opposable hind claws.

They are exceptionally long-lived, and most have low [[Reproduction|reproductive]] rates.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe young have a long, very fast-growing fledgling stage, followed by 3\u20138 weeks of nest care after first flight, and 1 to 3 years as [[sexual maturity|sexually immature]] adults. The sexes have conspicuously different sizes and sometimes a female is more than twice as heavy as her mate. This [[sexual dimorphism]] is sometimes most extreme in specialized bird-eaters, such as the ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks. [[Monogamy]] is the general rule, although an alternative mate is often selected if one dies.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAccipitriformes,(SEV\u0130M) currently with 255 species and 70 genera in 3 extant families, is the largest diurnal raptor order. DNA sequence analyses suggest that divergences within Accipitriformes(SEVIM) began around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary about 34 mya, with the split of the group including genera ''Elanus'' and ''Gampsonyx'' from the other Accipitriformes(SEV\u0130M) genera.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mindell |first1=David |last2=Fuchs |first2=Jerome |last3=Johnson |first3=Jeff |editor1-last=Sarasola |editor1-first=Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1n |editor2-last=Grande |editor2-first=Juan Manuel |editor3-last=Negro |editor3-first=Juan Jos\u00e9 |title=Birds of Prey Biology and conservation in the XXI century |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-73744-7 |pages=3\u201332 |ref= |chapter=Phylogeny, Taxonomy, and Geographic Diversity of Diurnal Raptors: Falconiformes, Accipitriformes, and Cathartiformes.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73745-4 }}</ref> \n\n\nThe order includes the following families:\n\n'''Order Accipitriformes'''\n* [[Accipitridae]] ([[vulture]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]], [[hawk]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kite]]s)\n* [[Pandionidae]] (ospreys) (1 or 2 species)\n* [[Sagittariidae]] (secretarybird)\n\nFor a complete list of species, see [[list of Accipitriformes species]].\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal| last = Chesser | first = R.

Their [[wing]]s are long and fairly broad, suitable for soaring flight, with the outer four to six  primary feathers emarginated.\n\nThey have strong legs and feet with raptorial [[claw]]s and opposable hind claws. Almost all Accipitriformes are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], hunting by sight during the day or at twilight. They are exceptionally long-lived, and most have low [[Reproduction|reproductive]] rates.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe young have a long, very fast-growing fledgling stage, followed by 3\u20138 weeks of nest care after first flight, and 1 to 3 years as [[sexual maturity|sexually immature]] adults. The sexes have conspicuously different sizes and sometimes a female is more than twice as heavy as her mate. This [[sexual dimorphism]] is sometimes most extreme in specialized bird-eaters, such as the ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks. [[Monogamy]] is the general rule, although an alternative mate is often selected if one dies.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAccipitriformes, currently with 255 species and 70 genera in 3 extant families, is the largest diurnal raptor order. DNA sequence analyses suggest that divergences within Accipitriformes began around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary about 34 mya, with the split of the group including genera ''Elanus'' and ''Gampsonyx'' from the other Accipitriformes genera.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mindell |first1=David |last2=Fuchs |first2=Jerome |last3=Johnson |first3=Jeff |editor1-last=Sarasola |editor1-first=Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1n |editor2-last=Grande |editor2-first=Juan Manuel |editor3-last=Negro |editor3-first=Juan Jos\u00e9 |title=Birds of Prey Biology and conservation in the XXI century |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-73744-7 |pages=3\u201332 |ref= |chapter=Phylogeny, Taxonomy, and Geographic Diversity of Diurnal Raptors: Falconiformes, Accipitriformes, and Cathartiformes.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73745-4 }}</ref> \n\n\nThe order includes the following families:\n\n'''Order Accipitriformes'''\n* [[Accipitridae]] ([[vulture]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]], [[hawk]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kite]]s)\n* [[Pandionidae]] (ospreys) (1 or 2 species)\n* [[Sagittariidae]] (secretarybird)\n\nFor a complete list of species, see [[list of Accipitriformes species]].\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal| last = Chesser | first = R.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147-3160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said.

Millions of years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' corn farmers Henry and Ida have children: Libby, Buck and the runt, Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to \"make their mark\" (a mud-print on the family's corn silo), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a caveboy, but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a flash flood before being swept away and killed.\n\nWithout his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his father's death, chases him into a river, where he hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day, Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him \"Spot\". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[pterodactyls]], led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out.\n\nThe group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers, and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of four rustler ''[[Velociraptor]]'', allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven out of the pasture, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye.

Ream noted \"Nature can overcome anything, including a massive dinosaur.\" In order to achieve the needed realism, the film's team traveled to the [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]], spending time in [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], [[Juntura, Oregon]], and southern [[Montana]]. Production designer [[Harley Jessup]] stated: \"The area has a fantastic variety of landscapes, ranging from the Jackson Valley and the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], we studied the grasslands of Montana and the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]], then incorporated all of it in Arlo's journey.\" To use the landscapes that they had experienced, the filmmakers used data from the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], and satellite images from [[Google Earth]]. The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on. According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi, this gave Sohn \"the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real.\" In addition, ''The Good Dinosaur'' features three-dimensional, volumetric clouds. In previous Pixar films, clouds have been \"painted\" onto the sets. Light and photography director Sharon Calahan explained: \"Storm clouds are almost like a villain in the film. Plus, it's very labor-intensive to paint clouds, and they're in almost every scene.\" Calahan also noted \"These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them, which we've never been able to properly do before.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\"/><ref name=\"Lesnick\"/>\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo-realistic, they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow. In terms of animating Arlo, animators Rob Thompson and Kevin O'Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion. Thompson stated: \"One of the most intimidating things to animate is a quadruped, because there's so much to them and there's so much to manage. It's very easy to make it not work if you don't know what you're managing. Locomotion is all about efficiency, a lot of times you think, 'We're animating a big, heavy character. We should slam those feet. That'll make it feel heavy.' The truth is, that's not efficient. That wouldn't be great for the legs.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\">{{cite web|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|title=Pixar Studios Doubles Effects In Upcoming Film \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|newspaper=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Lesnick\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=The Good Dinosaur Story: Behind the Scenes at Pixar|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Zacuto\"/> A system where Arlo's head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up, was therefore created. To get an idea of the scale of Arlo, a complete full-size model was built out of card and foam core. In total ''The Good Dinosaur'' took up 300[[Byte|TB]] of server space, ten times as much space as ''[[Monsters University]]'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-pixar-changed-all-the-rules-to-make-the-good-dinosa-1735364564|title=How Pixar Changed All The Rules To Make The Good Dinosaur A Stunning Masterpiece|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nArlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the \"boy\" inside the dinosaur. Sohn explained \"When Arlo gets lost in the wilderness, you need to worry that he's out of his element and in danger of getting killed, rather than just thinking 'You're an animal. Why don't you just turn around and eat some leaves?'\" He additionally stated \"If you put like a realistic dinosaur in the woods, eat some leaves, you're fine... But we really wanted to play with that twist of this is a boy out there. A dinosaur boy for sure, but trying to infuse those qualities into him... And also keeping him in a world that had an arc to itself. That it would start off being beautiful and then become dangerous. When we had these designs of the trees where they were a little bit more blocky and a little bit more graphic. We put Arlo in front of it, it's like 'ooh that kind of is cool, but boy, it doesn't feel like it's that dangerous.' Like when we get a rock stuck on him, it didn't feel like anything 'cause when we went on our research trips, boy that idea of like you can get, you could die by a small thing like having a rock on your foot. Or you could die by a huge thing like an avalanche, which we tried to kind of explore in the film. So that was one of our main intents.\"<ref name=io9Anders/><ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Interview: Director Peter Sohn Talks \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-sohn-good-dinosaur-interview/|website=[[slashfilm.com|/Film]]|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the film's setting, Sohn stated \"Pixar is all about the 'what if' question... 'What if the asteroid missed the earth?' Yeah, we went down the road of: they could be cooking in a dino diner; they could be in space; they could be in anything. But then there was a drawing of a dinosaur farming that kind of sparked people of the idea of 'he's working hard and this character needs to survive out there.' All of the American dinosaur bones are found in the northwest\u2014from Montana, to [[Oregon]], to [[Wyoming]], and [[the Dakotas]], so the combination of hardworking farm families and the west really brought us into that frontier world immediately... [S]o we started doing research. We started finding all of these people who were surviving out there on the land. They were either cultivating the cattle, or were ranchers in Oregon, or were farmers in the Midwest. It just kept teaching us how much we want to honor this world, and how hard it is to survive out there. It started dictating the world itself.\"<ref name=\"DisneyInsider\"/>\n\nSince ''The Good Dinosaur'' is set in a world in which dinosaurs never became extinct, they were instead able to evolve. Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and carnivores like the ''T. rex'' become ranchers.

Directed by [[Peter Sohn]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] and written by [[Meg LeFauve]] from an original idea by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], the film is set in an [[alternate history]] in which [[dinosaur]]s [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|never became extinct]]. The film follows a young and timid ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' named Arlo, who meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a harsh, dangerous and mysterious landscape. The film features the voices of [[Raymond Ochoa]], Jack Bright, [[Sam Elliott]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[A. J.

Millions of years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' corn farmers Henry and Ida have children: Libby, Buck and the runt, Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to \"make their mark\" (a mud-print on the family's corn silo), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a caveboy, but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a flash flood before being swept away and killed.\n\nWithout his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his father's death, chases him into a river, where he hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day, Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him \"Spot\". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[pterodactyls]], led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out.\n\nThe group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers, and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of four rustler ''[[Velociraptor]]'', allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven out of the pasture, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye. Arlo finally arrives home to his mother and siblings, and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--Do not add voice actors without official sources.--> \n<!--The species names must be consistent with the sources.-->\n* [[Raymond Ochoa]] as Arlo, a young ''[[Apatosaurus]]''<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/06/12/meet-the-new-cast-of-disneypixars-the-good-dinosaur/|title=Meet the New Cast of Disney\u2022Pixar\u2019s The Good Dinosaur |publisher=The Walt Disney Company|date= June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=\u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019 Preview: How John Ford and Hayao Miyazaki Helped Inspire Pixar|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-good-dinosaur-preview-how-john-ford-and-hayao-miyazaki-helped-inspire-pixar/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=June 18, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n** Jack McGraw as Young Arlo\n* Jack Bright as Spot, a 7-year-old human [[Caveman|caveboy]] who befriends Arlo<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Butch, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' who runs a \"ranch\" filled with prehistoric \"longhorns\"<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/>\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Ramsey, Butch's daughter<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[A.

Ream noted \"Nature can overcome anything, including a massive dinosaur.\" In order to achieve the needed realism, the film's team traveled to the [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]], spending time in [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], [[Juntura, Oregon]], and southern [[Montana]]. Production designer [[Harley Jessup]] stated: \"The area has a fantastic variety of landscapes, ranging from the Jackson Valley and the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], we studied the grasslands of Montana and the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]], then incorporated all of it in Arlo's journey.\" To use the landscapes that they had experienced, the filmmakers used data from the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], and satellite images from [[Google Earth]]. The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on. According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi, this gave Sohn \"the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real.\" In addition, ''The Good Dinosaur'' features three-dimensional, volumetric clouds. In previous Pixar films, clouds have been \"painted\" onto the sets. Light and photography director Sharon Calahan explained: \"Storm clouds are almost like a villain in the film. Plus, it's very labor-intensive to paint clouds, and they're in almost every scene.\" Calahan also noted \"These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them, which we've never been able to properly do before.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\"/><ref name=\"Lesnick\"/>\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo-realistic, they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow. In terms of animating Arlo, animators Rob Thompson and Kevin O'Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion. Thompson stated: \"One of the most intimidating things to animate is a quadruped, because there's so much to them and there's so much to manage. It's very easy to make it not work if you don't know what you're managing. Locomotion is all about efficiency, a lot of times you think, 'We're animating a big, heavy character. We should slam those feet. That'll make it feel heavy.' The truth is, that's not efficient. That wouldn't be great for the legs.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\">{{cite web|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|title=Pixar Studios Doubles Effects In Upcoming Film \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|newspaper=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Lesnick\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=The Good Dinosaur Story: Behind the Scenes at Pixar|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 9, 2015|date=October 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Zacuto\"/> A system where Arlo's head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up, was therefore created. To get an idea of the scale of Arlo, a complete full-size model was built out of card and foam core. In total ''The Good Dinosaur'' took up 300[[Byte|TB]] of server space, ten times as much space as ''[[Monsters University]]'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-pixar-changed-all-the-rules-to-make-the-good-dinosa-1735364564|title=How Pixar Changed All The Rules To Make The Good Dinosaur A Stunning Masterpiece|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nArlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the \"boy\" inside the dinosaur. Sohn explained \"When Arlo gets lost in the wilderness, you need to worry that he's out of his element and in danger of getting killed, rather than just thinking 'You're an animal. Why don't you just turn around and eat some leaves?'\" He additionally stated \"If you put like a realistic dinosaur in the woods, eat some leaves, you're fine... But we really wanted to play with that twist of this is a boy out there. A dinosaur boy for sure, but trying to infuse those qualities into him... And also keeping him in a world that had an arc to itself. That it would start off being beautiful and then become dangerous. When we had these designs of the trees where they were a little bit more blocky and a little bit more graphic. We put Arlo in front of it, it's like 'ooh that kind of is cool, but boy, it doesn't feel like it's that dangerous.' Like when we get a rock stuck on him, it didn't feel like anything 'cause when we went on our research trips, boy that idea of like you can get, you could die by a small thing like having a rock on your foot. Or you could die by a huge thing like an avalanche, which we tried to kind of explore in the film. So that was one of our main intents.\"<ref name=io9Anders/><ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Interview: Director Peter Sohn Talks \u2018The Good Dinosaur\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-sohn-good-dinosaur-interview/|website=[[slashfilm.com|/Film]]|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the film's setting, Sohn stated \"Pixar is all about the 'what if' question... 'What if the asteroid missed the earth?' Yeah, we went down the road of: they could be cooking in a dino diner; they could be in space; they could be in anything. But then there was a drawing of a dinosaur farming that kind of sparked people of the idea of 'he's working hard and this character needs to survive out there.' All of the American dinosaur bones are found in the northwest\u2014from Montana, to [[Oregon]], to [[Wyoming]], and [[the Dakotas]], so the combination of hardworking farm families and the west really brought us into that frontier world immediately... [S]o we started doing research. We started finding all of these people who were surviving out there on the land. They were either cultivating the cattle, or were ranchers in Oregon, or were farmers in the Midwest. It just kept teaching us how much we want to honor this world, and how hard it is to survive out there. It started dictating the world itself.\"<ref name=\"DisneyInsider\"/>\n\nSince ''The Good Dinosaur'' is set in a world in which dinosaurs never became extinct, they were instead able to evolve. Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and carnivores like the ''T. rex'' become ranchers.
