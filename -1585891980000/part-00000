The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories.

Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]].

The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire.

Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods.

In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans.

The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.

Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from North Africa, which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

He founded the Kongolo Dynasty, which was later ousted by [[Kalala Ilunga]]. Kalala expanded the kingdom west of [[Lake Kisale]]. A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]]. The [[Bemba people]] and [[Basimba people]]  of northern Zambia were descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia during the 17th century.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 138\u2013139.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 159\u2013160.</ref>\n\n===Lunda Empire===\n\n[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Lunda town and dwelling]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Lunda#Origin}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of the Lunda Empire}}\n\nIn the 1450s, a [[Luba Empire|Luba]] from the royal family [[Ilunga Tshibinda]] married [[Lunda people|Lunda]] queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son ''mulopwe'' Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

The [[Imbangala]] of inland [[Angola]] claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of ''mulopwe'' Tshibunda. ''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east. Each territory was assigned a ''mani-mpembe'' (provincial governor) by the ''manikongo''. In 1506, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] (1506\u20131542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 198\u2013199.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), p. 158.</ref>\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n{{main|Horn of Africa#History}}\n\n====Somalia====\n{{main|History of Somalia}}\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Boers=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

However, very little is known about Kitara; some scholars even question its historical existence.

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]].

He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king.

Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son [[Muhammed Bello]].

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=====Niger Delta and Igbo=====\n{{Further|Igbo people#History|Kingdom of Bonny#Early history|Kalabari Kingdom#History|Kingdom of Warri#History|Kingdom of Nri#History|List of rulers of Nri}}\n{{Igbo land labelled map}}\nThe [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous [[city-state]]s with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945.

Gabon fell to Free France after the [[Battle of Gabon]] in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until November 1942.  Vichy forces tried to resist the overwhelming [[Allied landings in North Africa]] (operation ''Torch'') in November 1942. Vichy Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] suddenly switched sides and the fighting ended.<ref>Arthur L.

With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories.

Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]].

The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire.

Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods.

In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans.

The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.

Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from North Africa, which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

He founded the Kongolo Dynasty, which was later ousted by [[Kalala Ilunga]]. Kalala expanded the kingdom west of [[Lake Kisale]]. A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]]. The [[Bemba people]] and [[Basimba people]]  of northern Zambia were descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia during the 17th century.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 138\u2013139.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 159\u2013160.</ref>\n\n===Lunda Empire===\n\n[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Lunda town and dwelling]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Lunda#Origin}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of the Lunda Empire}}\n\nIn the 1450s, a [[Luba Empire|Luba]] from the royal family [[Ilunga Tshibinda]] married [[Lunda people|Lunda]] queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son ''mulopwe'' Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

The [[Imbangala]] of inland [[Angola]] claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of ''mulopwe'' Tshibunda. ''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east. Each territory was assigned a ''mani-mpembe'' (provincial governor) by the ''manikongo''. In 1506, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] (1506\u20131542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 198\u2013199.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), p. 158.</ref>\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n{{main|Horn of Africa#History}}\n\n====Somalia====\n{{main|History of Somalia}}\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Boers=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

However, very little is known about Kitara; some scholars even question its historical existence.

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]].

He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king.

Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son [[Muhammed Bello]].

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=====Niger Delta and Igbo=====\n{{Further|Igbo people#History|Kingdom of Bonny#Early history|Kalabari Kingdom#History|Kingdom of Warri#History|Kingdom of Nri#History|List of rulers of Nri}}\n{{Igbo land labelled map}}\nThe [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous [[city-state]]s with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 180\u2013189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire.

Gabon fell to Free France after the [[Battle of Gabon]] in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until November 1942.  Vichy forces tried to resist the overwhelming [[Allied landings in North Africa]] (operation ''Torch'') in November 1942. Vichy Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] suddenly switched sides and the fighting ended.<ref>Arthur L.

De Gaulle finally won out.<ref>Arthur Layton Funk, ''Charles de Gaulle: the crucial years, 1943\u20131944'' (1959).</ref>\n\n===World War II: Military===\n\nSince Germany had lost its African colonies following World War I, World War II did not reach Africa until [[Pact of Steel|Italy joined the war]] on June 10, 1940, controlling Libya and Italian East Africa.  With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

Due to its isolated position from the coasts, this area has received minimal attention from historian pertaining to Africa. It also had one of the most varied sources of European colonial imperialists including Germany in Cameroon, Britain in Northern Cameroons, Belgium in Congo, and France in CAF. Due to its territory, among the main trope s regarding Central Africa is traversing its lands and the nature of its tropicals.<ref>Schmutterer, Heinz. \"Pests of crops in Northeast and Central Africa, with particular reference to the Sudan.\" Pests of crops in Northeast and Central Africa, with particular reference to the Sudan.

Professional scholarship appeared around 1900, and began with the study of business operations, typically using government documents and unpublished archives.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe economic approach was widely practiced in the 1930s, primarily to provide descriptions of the changes underway in the previous half-century. In 1935, American historian [[William L. Langer]] published ''The Diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890\u20131902'', a book that is still widely cited.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], Hiromi Go, Hikaru Genji and Sayuri Ishikawa.\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the [[Doraemon]] movies, as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6th, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his then junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to be an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to be a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU.

The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny.

Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbrievated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo.

Oe began playing piano at the age of three and received classical piano training from his then junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to be an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to be a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career.

The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music.

Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nFollowing graduation from The New School's jazz department, Oe launched his jazz record label PND Records, which is named after his dog \"Peace Never Die\" in 2012.

In her sophomore year she entered the ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine Guest Editor contest and was selected as one of 20 women from across the United States to work on the magazine for a month in New York City in 1953.

As a result, the U.S. GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the UK, as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn the early 1800s, the United States was largely agricultural with more than 80 percent of the population in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most rapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.<ref name=\"bushregulation\">{{cite magazine|title=Bush's Regulatory Kiss-Off \u2013 Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|magazine=Reason magazine|date=January 2009|access-date=February 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902085717/http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|archive-date=September 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\n{{Main|Taxation in the United States}}\n\n[[Taxation in the United States]] is a complex system which may involve payment to at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation.

In the early 20th century, the research developed through informal cooperation between U.S. industry and academia grew rapidly and by the late 1930s exceeded the size of that taking place in Britain (although the quality of U.S. research was not yet on par with British and German research at the time). After World War II, federal spending on defense R&D and antitrust policy played a significant role in U.S. innovation.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Walker, William|title=National innovation systems : a comparative analysis|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195076172|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Richard R.|location=New York|pages=61\u201364|chapter=National Innovation Systems: Britain|ref=Walker1993|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFDGjgxc2CYC&pg=PA61}}<!-- Author profile: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/people/index.php/wbw.html--></ref>\n\nThe United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil, and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate.

[[Consumer spending]] in the U.S. rose to about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to 71% in 2013.<ref name=consumerecon/> Throughout its history, the United States has experienced steady growth in the labor force, a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion. Until shortly after World War I, most workers were immigrants from Europe, their immediate descendants, or African Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EB29BrnCMm4C&pg=PA280 Trends in International Migration 2002: Continuous Reporting System on Migration]''\".

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered.

California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.10, based on Comtrade database]]\nThe United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock market.<ref>[http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/ludvigsons/osf.pdf Origins of Stock Market Fluctuations].

Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.\n\nTop ten U.S. banks by assets<ref name=\"money.msn.com\">[http://money.msn.com/ Stock quotes, investing & personal finance, news \u2013 MSN Money] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506025118/http://money.msn.com/ |date=May 6, 2013 }}.

Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

In most cases, this has been due to moving the manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could be made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a higher profit.

Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable boost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of securities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a [[bank run]] in the essentially unregulated [[shadow banking|non-depository]] banking system, which had outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East. Further, those 18 states that have not expanded Medicaid had a higher uninsured rate than those that did.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2018/apr/health-coverage-erosion Commonwealth Fund \u2013 First Look at Health Insurance Coverage in 2018 Finds ACA Gains Beginning to Reverse]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year.<ref name=uninsureddeaths>{{cite web |last= Woolhandler |first= S. |date= September 12, 2012 |title= Despite slight drop in uninsured, last year's figure points to 48,000 preventable deaths |publisher= Physicians for a National Health Program |url= http://www.pnhp.org/news/2012/september/despite-slight-drop-in-uninsured-last-year%E2%80%99s-figure-points-to-48000-preventable- |accessdate= September 26, 2012 |display-authors= etal |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120924021844/http://www.pnhp.org/news/2012/september/despite-slight-drop-in-uninsured-last-year%E2%80%99s-figure-points-to-48000-preventable- |archive-date= September 24, 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The group's methodology has been criticized by [[John C.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly.

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America.

Other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]\nThe United States of America invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the USA has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact of recession on research spending ===\nGenerally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$ 406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:World shares of GDP, GERD, researchers and publications for the G20, 2009 and 2013.svg|thumb|World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific publications, 2009 and 2013.

American supremacy is eroding in this respect, even as other nations\u2014China, in particular\u2014are carrying their own investment in R&D to new heights. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Business spending on research ===\nBusiness enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:R&D budget by US agency, 1994\u20132014.svg|thumb|US research and development budget by government agency, 1994\u20132014.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending at the state level ===\n{{See also|List of U.S. states by research and development spending}}\nThe level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Science and engineering in the USA by state, 2010.svg|thumb|Science and engineering in the United States of America by state. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\nCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. The two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanical single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION: A SHIFT TO KNOW ABOUT]]</ref> Second, there's the newer [[dual-clutch transmission]], which was first used by the Volkswagen Group in the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]] in 2003, and now commonly used by other manufacturers. A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission. It consists of a conventional [[manual transmission]] with an electronically-controlled hydraulic clutch and computerized gear shift control, and the driver can usually override the computer control with a clutchless \"manual\" mode.<ref>[[https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/mission-transmission/]]</ref> It has a lower cost than any other types of automatic transmissions<ref name=\"zf1\" /> \nAn Automated manual transmission can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control.<ref name=\"x-engineer1\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:1913-1923 Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F Berline crop.jpg|thumb|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F gear shift ring (mounted inside steering wheel)]]\nIn 1901, [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e]] developed a method of shifting gears which did not require the use of a [[clutch]] and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\">{{cite web \n|title=The history of the 'paddle shift' \n|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/the-history-of-the-paddle-shift/2922\n|website=lemans.org\n|date=2011-02-21\n|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, automakers began to market cars with some sort of device that would reduce the amount of clutching and de-clutching and shifting required in stop and go driving. Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears.

These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.\n\n==Types==\n* [[Dual-clutch transmission]]\n* [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission]] (e.g. BMW sequential manual gearbox, SMG)\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Saxomat]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n* [[Shift kit]]\n* [[Shift time]]\n* [[Dual clutch transmission]] (DCT)\n* [[Automatic manual transmission]]\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Honda I-SHIFT]]\n* [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]\n* [[Automatic transmission]]\n* [[Tiptronic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-automatic transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Transmission types}}\nA '''semi-automatic transmission''' (also known as an '''automated manual'''<ref>[[https://www.caradvice.com.au/278721/transmissions-explained-manual-v-automatic-v-dual-clutch-v-cvt-v-others/]]</ref> <ref name=\"nacfe1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://nacfe.org/technology/automated-manual-transmissions-2/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmissions\n|website=North American Council for Freight Efficiency\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''clutchless manual'''<ref name=\"autonews1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20010401/SUB/104010719/the-next-shift-the-clutchless-manual\n|title=The next shift: The clutchless manual\n|website=autonews.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''auto-manual'''<ref name=\"x-engineer1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://x-engineer.org/automotive-engineering/drivetrain/transmissions/automated-manual-transmissions-amt/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)\n|website=x-engineer.org\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''semi-manual'''<ref name=\"thezebra1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/2805/manual-vs-automatic/\n|title=Manual vs. Automatic Transmissions: Who's Winning? - Insurance News\n|website=thezebra.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=April 7, 2016\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''trigger shift''', '''flappy-paddle''' or '''paddle-shift''' gearbox) is an [[automobile transmission]] that combines [[manual transmission]] and [[automatic transmission]].\n\nSemi-automatic term refers to a single-clutch [[manual transmission]] (with an automated clutch, but requires the driver to shift the gears manually), allowing for convenient driver control of gear selection (in road cars), or a single-clutch [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential transmission]] with electronic operated paddle shifters and an electrohydraulic or electro-pneumatic actuated clutch and dog box gear engagement as used in race cars.<ref>Drivetribe.com \n[https://drivetribe.com/p/sequential-sorrow-1989-ferrari-U9zAMNPcScu0UqBZ4NZGPg?iid=VMEsFpv0Rru6efh8RBsrGA/ SEQUENTIAL SORROW - 1989 FERRARI 640]</ref><ref>Formula1-Dictionary.net [http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/gearbox.html/ Gearbox]</ref> For most of automotive history, conventional automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or [[Gear stick|shifter]], usually to limit the transmission shifting beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gears when towing.  It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. The two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanically actuated single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS.

A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission.

Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears. All this is actuated automatically, and operated through the electrohydraulic actuators of the transmission's computer.<ref name=\"caranddriver3\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15366473/shift-this-a-history-of-porsches-sportomatic-tiptronic-and-pdk-transmissions/\n|title=A History of Porsche\u2019s Sportomatic, Tiptronic, and PDK Transmissions\n|website=Car and Driver\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=Dec 10, 2013\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\n===Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi / Dacia / Infiniti===\nFor the [[Renault Dauphine]], a Ferlec semi-automatic was offered from 1957 until 1963, when the \"fully automatic\" Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available.

Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle (on sale in August 1967), and was made available on the Karmann Ghia during 1968.

Buttons on the steering wheel, which go directly to a certain gear\u2014rather than sequentially\u2014are still permitted.\n\n===Trucks and buses===\nSemi-automatic transmissions have also made their way into the [[truck]] and [[bus]] market in the early 2000s. [[Volvo]] offers its [[Volvo I-Shift|I-Shift]] on its heavier [[Volvo Trucks|trucks]] and [[Volvo Buses|buses]] as well [[UD Trucks]] with ESCOT, while [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]] markets its ASTronic system for trucks, buses and coaches. In North America, [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] offers the \"AutoShift\" system which is an add-on to traditional non-synchromesh [[manual transmission]]s for heavy trucks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_53974/title_Leading-Transmission-Maker-Predicts-Major-Shift-to-Automatics-in-Heavy-Vehicles/newsarticle.html |title=Leading Transmission Maker Predicts Major Shift to Automatics in Heavy Vehicles - AutoWeb News |publisher=Autoweb.com.au |accessdate=2014-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727024751/http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_53974/title_Leading-Transmission-Maker-Predicts-Major-Shift-to-Automatics-in-Heavy-Vehicles/newsarticle.html |archivedate=27 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These [[gearbox]]es have a place in [[public transport]] as they have been shown to reduce fuel consumption in some specific cases.\n\n====Bristol/Daimler/Leyland buses====\nThe British employed pneumatic valve bodies to regulate gear shifting by charging pistons with compressed air within the gearbox. These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.\n\n==Types==\n* [[Dual-clutch transmission]]\n* [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission]] (e.g. BMW sequential manual gearbox, SMG)\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Saxomat]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n* [[Shift kit]]\n* [[Shift time]]\n* [[Dual clutch transmission]] (DCT)\n* [[Automatic manual transmission]]\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Honda I-SHIFT]]\n* [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]\n* [[Automatic transmission]]\n* [[Tiptronic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-automatic transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n", "name_user": "Davism0703", "label": "safe", "comment": "Electromechanical.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}
