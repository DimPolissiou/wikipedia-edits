The town's present name originated during the Spanish colonial era. A group of Spanish soldiers were on patrol and went on to rest on a sitio. The villagers were curious about the soldiers because of their unusual descent and fair skin color. They flocked the soldiers touching their guns, too afraid that the guns might explode accidentally, one villager asked the soldier in a local vernacular.. \"Aoan bala?\" (meaning \"No bullets?\"). The soldier did not understand what the villager meant, he uttered the last word first, and remembering the last, he said \"Bala-aoan\".\n\nDuring the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]], a secret society of ''insurrectos'' was organized in the municipality. Its purpose was to fight and [[Philippine revolts against Spain|revolt against the Spanish Government]] in the area. On the eve of the revolution, a traitor told the Spanish of their plan. The Spanish soldiers, without any investigation arrested seven members of the secret society, and executed them the same night. Only one, Fernando Ostrea, escaped with leg wounds. He informed the people about what has happened. In memory of the seven Martyrs, a masonic lodge, Siete Martires Lodge No. 177, was organized.\n\nBalaoan is one of the oldest municipalities in La Union, having been founded in 1704. Its first ''Capitan'' is Ignacio Duldulao.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balaoan\n| 1903 = 10008\n| 1918 = 11276\n| 1939 = 12773\n| 1948 = 14274\n| 1960 = 17401\n| 1970 = 22331\n| 1975 = 24381\n| 1980 = 25197\n| 1990 = 30042\n| 1995 = 31420\n| 2000 = 33786\n| 2007 = 36829\n| 2010 = 37910\n| 2015 = 39188\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Balaoan was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe dominant language spoken in Balaoan is [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]].\n\n==Festivities==\nThe [[Balaoan Church|church of Balaoan]] is under the advocacy of the town's patron saint, St. Nicholas of Tolentino, whose feast day is celebrated on September.

The town's present name originated during the Spanish colonial era. A group of Spanish soldiers were on patrol and went on to rest on a sitio. The villagers were curious about the soldiers because of their unusual descent and fair skin color. They flocked the soldiers touching their guns, too afraid that the guns might explode accidentally, one villager asked the soldier in a local vernacular.. \"Aoan bala?\" (meaning \"No bullets?\"). The soldier did not understand what the villager meant, he uttered the last word first, and remembering the last, he said \"Bala-aoan\".\n\nDuring the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]], a secret society of ''insurrectos'' was organized in the municipality. Its purpose was to fight and [[Philippine revolts against Spain|revolt against the Spanish Government]] in the area. On the eve of the revolution, a traitor told the Spanish of their plan. The Spanish soldiers, without any investigation arrested seven members of the secret society, and executed them the same night. Only one, Fernando Ostrea, escaped with leg wounds. He informed the people about what has happened. In memory of the seven Martyrs, a masonic lodge, Siete Martires Lodge No. 177, was organized.\n\nBalaoan is one of the oldest municipalities in La Union, having been founded in 1704. Its first ''Capitan'' is Ignacio Duldulao.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balaoan\n| 1903 = 10008\n| 1918 = 11276\n| 1939 = 12773\n| 1948 = 14274\n| 1960 = 17401\n| 1970 = 22331\n| 1975 = 24381\n| 1980 = 25197\n| 1990 = 30042\n| 1995 = 31420\n| 2000 = 33786\n| 2007 = 36829\n| 2010 = 37910\n| 2015 = 39188\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Balaoan was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe dominant language spoken in Balaoan is [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]].\n\n==Festivities==\nThe [[Balaoan Church|church of Balaoan]] is under the advocacy of the town's patron saint, St. Nicholas of Tolentino, whose feast day is celebrated on September.

{"title_page": "Gun turret", "text_new": "{{short description|Weapon mount with protection and cone of fire}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Maille-Braize-canon.jpg|thumb|A modern naval gun turret (A [[French 100 mm naval gun]] on the ''[[French destroyer Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 (D627)|Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9]]'' pictured) allows firing of the cannons via remote control. Loading of ammunition is also often done by automatic mechanisms.]]\n\nA '''gun turret''' (or simply '''turret''') is a platform from which weapons can be fired that affords protection, visibility and some cone of fire.  A modern gun turret is generally a rotatable [[weapon mount]] that houses the crew or [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] of a [[artillery|projectile-firing weapon]] and at the same time lets the weapon be aimed and fired in some degree of [[azimuth]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] (cone of fire).\n\n== Description ==\nRotating gun turrets protect the bish and its bish as they rotate.  When this meaning of the word \"bish boi\" started being used at the beginning of the 1860s, turrets were normally cylindrical.   [[Barbettes]] were an alternative to turrets; with a barbette the protection was fixed, and the weapon and crew were on a rotating platform inside the barbette.  In the 1890s, armoured hoods (also known as \"gun houses\") were added to barbettes; these rotated with the platform (hence the term \"hooded barbette\").  By the early 20th Century, these hoods were known as turrets.  Modern warships have gun-mountings described as turrets, though the \"protection\" on them is limited to protection from the weather.\n\nRotating turrets can be mounted on a [[fortification|fortified]] [[building]] or [[structure]] such as a coastal blockhouse, be part of a [[land battery]], be mounted on a [[combat vehicle]], a [[naval ship]], or a [[military aviation|military aircraft]], they may be armed with one or more [[machine gun]]s, [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]], large-[[caliber|calibre]] guns, or [[Multiple rocket launcher|missile launcher]]s. They may be manned or [[Remote weapon station|remotely controlled]] and are most often protected to some degree, if not actually [[vehicle armour|armoured]].\n\nThe protection provided by the turret may be against battle damage, the weather conditions, general environment in which the weapon or its crew will be operating. The name derives from the pre-existing noun [[turret]], from the French \"touret\", diminutive of the word \"tower\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Turret n. |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/turret |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> meaning ''a self-contained protective position which is situated on top of a fortification or defensive wall'' as opposed to rising directly from the ground, in which case it constitutes a [[tower]].\n\n=== Cupolas ===\n[[File:Conqueror cupola, Bovington Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|The commander's cupola of a [[Conqueror tank]] with a machine gun.]]\n\n{{anchor|Cupola}}\n\nA small turret, or sub-turret set on top of a larger one, is called a '''cupola'''. The term ''cupola'' is also used for a rotating turret that carries a sighting device rather than weaponry, such as that used by a [[tank]] commander.{{efn-lr|name=Cupola|In architecture, a [[cupola]] is a small, most often dome-like, structure on top of a building, so although it is often used to describe a sub-turret such as commander's sub-turret on a tank turret, if a gun turret is mounted on a vessel or above a bunker and is dome shaped it too may be referred to as a cupola in some sources.}}\n\n== Warships ==\nBefore the development of large-calibre, long-range guns in the mid-19th century, the classic [[battleship]] design{{efn-lr|See [[box battery]] and [[central battery ship]]}} used rows of gunport-mounted guns on each side of the ship, often mounted in [[casemate]]s. Firepower was provided by a large number of guns, each of which could traverse only in a limited arc. Due to stability issues, fewer large (and thus heavy) guns can be carried high on a ship, but as this set casemates low and thus near the waterline they were vulnerable to flooding, effectively restricted their use to calm seas. Additionally casemate mounts had to be recessed into the side of a vessel to afford a wide arc of fire, and such recesses presented [[shot trap]]s, compromising the integrity of armour plating.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}\n\nRotating turrets were [[weapon mount]]s designed to protect the crew and mechanism of the [[artillery|artillery piece]] and with the capability of being aimed and fired over a broad arc, typically between a three-quarter circle up to and including a full 360 degrees. These presented the opportunity to concentrate firepower in fewer, better-sited positions by eliminating redundancy, in other words combining the firepower of those guns unable to engage an enemy because they sited on the wrong beam into a more powerful, and more versatile unified battery.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Gun or Mortar cask raft and proposed Cupola ship.png|thumb|left|Captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles|Cowper Coles']] proposed cupola ship, 1860.]]\n[[File:BEP-(unk)-In the Turret.jpg|thumb|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|vignette]] ''In the Turret'' (engraved before 1863).]]\n\nDesigns for a rotating gun turret date back to the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-KbN-xWTj7kC&pg=PT36&dq=Gillespie+Turret+1805#v=onepage&q=Gillespie+Turret+1805&f=false|title=Duel Between the First Ironclads|first=William C.|last=Davis|date=9 May 2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|accessdate=29 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780307817501}}</ref> In the mid 19th century, during the [[Crimean War]], Captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles]] constructed a [[raft]] with guns protected by a 'cupola' and used the raft,{{efn-lr|name=Cupola}} named the [[Siege of Taganrog|''Lady Nancy'']], to shell the Russian town of [[Taganrog]] in the [[Black Sea]].

Coles's aim was to create a ship with the greatest possible all round arc of fire, as low in the water as possible to minimise the target.<ref name=\"Barnaby\">{{cite book |title=Some ship disasters and their causes |author=K.

Coles submitted a design for a ship having ten domed turrets each housing two large guns.\n\nThe design was rejected as impractical, although the Admiralty remained interested in turret ships and instructed its own designers to create better designs. Coles enlisted the support of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who wrote to the first Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Somerset, supporting the construction of a turret ship. In January 1862, the Admiralty agreed to construct a ship, [[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']] which had four turrets and a low freeboard, intended only for coastal defence.\n\n[[File:HMS Prince Albert (1864).jpg|thumb|[[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']], a pioneering turret ship, whose turrets were designed by [[Cowper Phipps Coles]].]]\nWhile Coles designed the turrets, the ship was the responsibility of Chief Constructor [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]].<ref name=\"Barnaby\" /> Another ship using Coles' turret designs, {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1857|6}}, was completed in August 1864.

An [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[turret ship]] designed by [[Edward James Reed]], she was equipped with revolving turrets that used pioneering hydraulic turret machinery to maneouvre the guns. She was also the world's first mastless [[battleship]], built with a central [[superstructure]] layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships. With her sister {{HMS|Devastation|1871|6}} of 1871 she was another pivotal design, and led directly to the modern battleship.\n\n[[File:USS Georgia turret.tiff|thumb|left|Superposed turrets on {{USS|Georgia|BB-15|6}}]]\n\nThe US Navy tried to save weight and allow the much faster firing [[8\"/45 caliber gun|8-inch]] to shoot during the long reload time necessary for [[12\"/40 caliber gun|12-inch]] guns by superposing secondary gun turrets directly on top of the primary turrets (as in the {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|2}}s), but the idea proved to be practically unworkable and was soon abandoned.{{efn-lr|Something similar occurred in American armoured vehicle designs around the time of the Second World War, tanks sprouting 'superfiring' turrets including the [[M3 Grant|M3 Lee]] and [[M60 Patton|M60A2 Patton]]. Given they were generally intended for an already-overburdened commander to operate, they have largely been abandoned in favour of literally lower-profile arrangements for protected observation with, in some cases, top-mounted remotely-operated weapons.}}\n\nWith the advent of the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|2}}s in 1908, the main battery turrets were designed so as to [[superfire]], to improve fire arcs on centerline mounted weapons. This was necessitated by a need to move all main battery turrets to the vessel's centerline for improved structural support. The 1906 {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, while revolutionary in many other ways, had retained [[Gun turret#Wing turrets|wing turret]]s due to concerns about muzzle blast affecting the sighting mechanisms of a turret below. A similar advancement was in the {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|2}}s and {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s, which dispensed with the \"Q\" turret amidships in favour of heavier guns in fewer mountings.\n\n[[File:Quadruple gun mounting in 24 Shop, Elswick Works (26345255273).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|King George V|41|6}} four-gun turret]]\n\nLike [[pre-dreadnought]]s, the first dreadnoughts had two guns in each turret; however, later ships began to be fitted with triple turrets. The first ship to be built with triple turrets was the Italian {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}}, although the first to be actually commissioned was the Austro-Hungarian {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} of the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}. By the beginning of [[World War II]], most battleships used triple or, occasionally, quadruple turrets, which reduced the total number of mountings and improved armour protection. However, quadruple turrets proved to be extremely complex to arrange, making them unwieldy in practice.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck''{{'}}s secondary battery 15&nbsp;cm gun turret]]\n\nThe largest warship turrets were in World War II battleships where a heavily armoured enclosure protected the large gun crew during battle. The calibre of the main armament on large battleships was typically {{convert|300|to|460|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The turrets carrying three 460&nbsp;mm guns of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} each weighed around 2,500 tonnes. The secondary armament of battleships (or the primary armament of [[light cruiser]]s) was typically between {{convert|127|and|152|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Smaller ships typically mounted guns from {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} upwards, although these rarely required a turret mounting, except for large destroyers, like the American {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|5}} and the German [[Type 1936A-class destroyer|''Narvik'']] classes.\n\n=== Layout ===\n[[File:Animated gun turret.gif|thumb|250px|right|Animation showing gun turret operation of the Stark I turret of the British [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun]]. Compare the layout and nomenclature with the US design below.]]\n[[File:Iowa 16 inch Gun-EN.svg|thumb|350px|right|Cutaway illustration of a US [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] turret]]\n\nIn naval terms, ''turret'' traditionally and specifically refers to a gun mounting where the entire mass rotates as one, and has a trunk that projects below the [[deck (ship)|deck]]. The rotating part of a turret seen above deck is the gunhouse, which protects the mechanism and crew, and is where the guns are loaded. The gunhouse is supported on a bed of rotating rollers, and is not necessarily physically attached to the ship at the base of the rotating structure.  In the case of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']], the turrets were not vertically restrained and fell out when she sank.  The [[HMS Hood|British battlecruiser ''Hood'']], like some American battleships, did have vertical restraints.<ref>{{citation|title=A Marine Forensic Analysis of HMS Hood and DKM Bismarck|first1= William|last1= Jurens |first2=William H |last2=Garzke Jr|first3=Robert O|last3= Dulin Jr|first4= John |last4=Roberts|first5=Richard |last5=Fiske |page=14|citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.317}}</ref>\n\nBelow the gunhouse there may be a working chamber, where ammunition is handled, and the main trunk, which accommodates the [[shell (projectile)|shell]] and [[propellant]] hoists that bring ammunition up from the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] below. There may be a combined hoist (''cf'' the animated British turret) or separate hoists (''cf'' the US turret cutaway). The working chamber and trunk rotate with the gunhouse, and sit inside a protective [[vehicle armour|armoured]] [[barbette]]. The barbette extends down to the main armoured deck (red in the animation). At the base of the turret sit handing rooms, where shell and propelling charges are passed from the shell room and magazine to the hoists.\n\nThe handling equipment and hoists are complex arrangements of machinery that transport the shells and charges from the magazine into the base of the turret. Bearing in mind that shells can weigh around a [[long ton|ton]], the hoists have to be powerful and rapid; a 15-inch turret of the type in the animation was expected to perform a complete loading and firing cycle in a minute.<ref>Capt. S. W. Roskill, RN, HMS ''Warspite'', Classics of Naval Literature, Naval Institute Press, 1997 {{ISBN|1-55750-719-8}}</ref>\n\nThe loading system is fitted with a series of [[interlock (engineering)|mechanical interlocks]] that ensure that there is never an open path from the gunhouse to the magazine down which an [[Explosives#Sensitivity|explosive flash]] might pass. Flash-tight doors and scuttles open and close to allow the passage between areas of the turret. Generally, with large-calibre guns, powered or assisted ramming is required to force the heavy shell and charge into the [[breech-loading weapon|breech]].\n\nAs the hoist and breech must be aligned for ramming to occur, there is generally a restricted range of elevations at which the guns can be loaded; the guns return to the loading elevation, are loaded, then return to the target elevation, at which time they are said to be \"in battery\". The animation illustrates a turret where the rammer is fixed to the cradle that carries the guns, allowing loading to occur across a wider range of elevations.\n\nEarlier turrets differed significantly in their operating principles. It was not until the last of the \"rotating drum\" designs described in the previous section were phased out that the \"hooded barbette\" arrangement above became the standard.\n\n=== Wing turrets ===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|right|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] had a main battery 12&nbsp;inch wing turret on either beam.]]\nA '''wing turret''' is a gun turret mounted along the side, or the wings, of a [[warship]], off the centerline.\n\nThe positioning of a wing turret limits the gun's arc of fire, so that it generally can contribute to only the [[broadside]] weight of fire on one side of the ship. This is the major weakness of wing turrets as broadsides were the most prevalent type of gunnery duels. Depending on the configurations of ships, such as HMS ''Dreadnought'' but not {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher}}, the wing turrets could fire fore and aft, so this somewhat reduced the danger when an opponent [[crossing the T|crossed the T]] enabling it to fire a full broadside.\n\n[[File:SMS Von der Tann Brassey's 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of the  battlecruiser ''Von der Tann'', Brassey's ''Naval Annual'' 1913, showing wing turrets amidships.]]\n\nAttempts were made to mount '''turrets ''en echelon''''' so that they could fire on either beam, such as the {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|0}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann}} [[battlecruiser]]s, but this tended to cause great damage to the ships' deck from the muzzle blast.\n\n[[File:Klasa radetzky.png|thumb|right|The pre-dreadnought battleship {{SMS|Radetzky}} with two main gun turrets on centreline and four secondary on the sides]]\n\nWing turrets were commonplace on [[capital ship]]s and [[cruiser]]s during the late 19th century up until the early 1910s. In [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, the wing turret contributed to the [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of sub-calibre weapons. In large [[armoured cruiser]]s, wing turrets contributed to the main battery, although the [[casemate]] mounting was more common. At the time, large numbers of smaller calibre guns contributing to the broadside were thought to be of great value in demolishing a ship's upperworks and secondary armaments, as distances of battle were limited by fire control and weapon performance.\n\nIn the early 1900s, weapon performance, [[vehicle armour|armour quality]] and vessel speeds generally increased along with the distances of engagement; the utility of large secondary batteries reducing as a consequence, and in addition at extreme range it was impossible to see the fall of lesser weapons and so correct the aim. Therefore, most early [[dreadnought battleship]]s featured \"all big gun\" armaments of identical calibre, typically 11 or 12&nbsp;inches, some of which were mounted in wing turrets. This arrangement was not satisfactory, however, as the wing turrets not only had a reduced fire arc for broadsides, but also because the weight of the guns put great strain on the hull and it was increasingly difficult to properly armour them.\n\nLarger and later dreadnought battleships carried superimposed or superfiring turrets (i.e. one turret mounted higher than and firing over those in front of and below it). This allowed all turrets to train on either beam, and increased the weight of fire forward and aft. The superfiring or superimposed arrangement had not been proven until after ''South Carolina'' went to sea, and it was initially feared that the weakness of the previous {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|0}} ship's stacked turrets would repeat itself. Larger and later guns (such as the US Navy's ultimate big gun design, the [[16\"/50 Mark 7]]) also could not be shipped in wing turrets, as the strain on the hull would have been too great.\n\n===Modern turrets===\n[[File:HMS Northumberland (F238) at West India South Dock - 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun 02.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Glass-reinforced plastic|GRP]] gunhouse is a common feature on modern naval gun turrets, this example being on the frigate {{HMS|Northumberland|F238|6}}.]]\n\nMany modern surface warships have mountings for large calibre guns, although the calibres are now generally between {{convert|3|and|5|in}}. The gunhouses are often just weatherproof covers for the gun mounting equipment and are made of light un-armoured materials such as [[glass-reinforced plastic]]. Modern turrets are often automatic in their operation, with no humans working inside them and only a small team passing fixed ammunition into the feed system. Smaller calibre weapons often operate on the [[autocannon]] principle, and indeed may not even be turrets at all; they may just be bolted directly to the deck.\n\n=== Turret identification ===\nOn board warships, each turret is given an identification. In the British [[Royal Navy]], these would be letters: \"A\" and \"B\" were for the turrets from the front of the ship backwards in front of the bridge, and letters near the end of the alphabet (i.e., \"X\", \"Y\", etc.) were for turrets behind the bridge ship, \"Y\" being the rearmost. Mountings in the middle of the ship would be \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", etc.<ref>{{cite book |last =Keegan |first =John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =[https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 281] |isbn =978-0-670-81416-9 |url-access =registration |url =https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 }}</ref> Confusingly, the {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser}}s had a \"Q\" and the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship}}s had an \"X\" turret in what would logically be \"C\" position; the latter being mounted at the main deck level in front of the bridge and behind the \"B\" turret, thus having restricted training fore and aft.{{efn-lr|The ''Nelson'' design was an adaption of an earlier planned battleship with two turrets before the bridge and a single one behind the bridge but in front of the aft superstructure.}}\n\nSecondary turrets were named \"P\" and \"S\" ([[Port (nautical)|port]] and [[starboard]]) and numbered from fore to aft, e.g. ''P1'' being the forward port turret.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nExceptions were of course made; the battleship [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|HMS ''Agincourt'']] had the uniquely large number of seven turrets. These were numbered \"1\" to \"7\" but were unofficially nicknamed \"Sunday\", Monday\", etc. through to \"Saturday\".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn German use, turrets were generally named \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", going from bow to stern. Usually the [[radio alphabet]] was used on naming the turrets (e.g. \"Anton\", \"Bruno\" or \"Berta\", \"Caesar\", \"Dora\") as on the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the [[United States Navy]], turrets are numbered [[Bow (ship)|fore]] to [[aft]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Aircraft==\n\n===History===\n\nDuring World War I, [[air gunner]]s initially operated guns that were mounted on pedestals or swivel mounts known as [[Weapon mount#Pintle|pintle]]s.  The latter evolved into the [[Scarff ring]], a rotating ring mount which allowed the gun to be turned to any direction with the gunner remaining directly behind it, the weapon held in an intermediate elevation by [[bungee cord]], a simple and effective mounting for single weapons such as the [[Lewis gun|Lewis Gun]] though less handy when twin mounted as with the British [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] and German [[Idflieg aircraft designation system#List of Idflieg class letter prefixes|\"CL\"-class two-seaters]] such as the [[Halberstadt CL.II|Halberstadt]] and [[Hannover CL.II|Hannover]]-designed series of compact two-seat combat aircraft. In a failed 1916 experiment, a variant of the [[SPAD S.A]] two-seat fighter was probably the first aircraft to be fitted with a remotely-controlled gun, which was located in a nose [[nacelle]].\n\nAs aircraft flew higher and faster, the need for protection from the elements led to the enclosure or shielding of the gun positions, as in the \"lobsterback\" rear seat of the [[Hawker Demon]] biplane fighter.\n\n[[File:BP Overstrand.jpg|thumb|The [[Boulton & Paul Overstrand]] biplane was the first RAF bomber to carry an enclosed turret.]]\n\nThe first British operational bomber to carry an enclosed, power-operated turret was the British [[Boulton & Paul Overstrand]] twin-engined biplane, which first flew in 1933. The Overstrand was similar to its [[First World War]] predecessors in that it had open [[cockpit]]s and hand-operated defensive machine guns.<ref>Claus Reuter, ''Development of Aircraft Turrets in the AAF, 1917\u20131944'', Scarborough, Ont., German Canadian Museum of Applied History, 2000 p. 11.</ref> However, unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h) making operating the exposed gun positions difficult, particularly in the aircraft's nose. To overcome this problem, the Overstrand was fitted with an enclosed and powered [[nose turret]], mounting a single [[Lewis gun]]. As such the Overstrand was the first British aircraft to have a power-operated turret. Rotation was handled by [[pneumatic]] motors while elevation and depression of the gun used [[hydraulic]] rams. The pilot's cockpit was also enclosed but the dorsal (upper) and ventral (belly) gun positions remained open, though shielded.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202850.html The Overstrand's Turret] ''Flight'' 1936</ref>\n\n[[File:Martin YB-10.jpg|thumb|right|A Martin YB-10 service test bomber with the USAAC - the first flight of the B-10 design occurred in mid-February 1932.]]\nThe [[Martin B-10]] all-metal [[monocoque]] monoplane bomber introduced turret-mounted defensive armament within the [[United States Army Air Corps]], almost simultaneously with the RAF's Overstrand biplane bomber design. The Martin XB-10 prototype aircraft first featured the nose turret in June 1932\u2014roughly a year ''before'' the less advanced Overstrand airframe design\u2014and was first produced as the YB-10 service test version by November 1933. The production B-10B version started service with the USAAC in July 1935.\n\n[[File:Pima Air & Space Museum - Aircraft 11.JPG|thumb|right|A B-24 Liberator rear turret.]]\n\nIn time the number of turrets carried and the number of guns mounted increased. RAF heavy bombers of World War II such as the [[Handley Page Halifax]] (until its [[Handley Page Halifax#Improvements|Mk II Series I (Special) version]] omitted the nose turret), [[Short Stirling]] and [[Avro Lancaster]]  typically had three powered turrets: rear, mid-upper and nose. (Early in the war, some British heavy bombers also featured a retractable, remotely-operated [[ventral turret|ventral]] (or mid-under) turret). The rear turret mounted the heaviest armament: four [[.303 British|0.303&nbsp;inch]] [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] or, late in the war, two AN/M2 light-barrel versions of the US [[Browning M2 machine gun]] as in the [[Rose turret|Rose-Rice turret]]. The [[tail gunner]] or \"Tail End Charlie\" position was generally accepted to be the most dangerous assignment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the World War II era, British turrets were largely self-contained units, manufactured by [[Boulton Paul Aircraft]] and [[Nash & Thompson]]. The same model of turret might be fitted to several different aircraft types.\nSome models included [[Automatic Gun-Laying Turret|gun-laying radar]] that could [[Deflection (military)|lead]] the target and compensate for [[bullet drop]].\n\nAs almost a 1930s \"updated\" adaptation of the earlier Bristol F.2's concept, the UK introduced the concept of the \"turret fighter\", with aeroplanes such as the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]] and [[Blackburn Roc]] where the armament (four 0.303 inch) machineguns was in a turret mounted behind the pilot, rather than in fixed positions in the wings. The Defiant and Roc possessed no fixed, forward-firing automatic ordnance; the World War I-era Bristol F.2 was designed with one synchronized [[Vickers machine gun]] firing forward on a fuselage mount.\n\nThe concept came at a time when the standard armament of a fighter was only two machine guns and in the face of heavily armed bombers operating in formation, it was thought that a group of turret fighters would be able to concentrate their fire flexibly on the bombers; making beam, stern and rising attacks practicable. Although the idea had some merits in attacking bombers it made the turret fighter a sitting duck when facing fighters: the weight and drag penalty of the turret (and gunner) so reduced the power to weight ratio they operated at a huge disadvantage, one the theoretical flexibility of the turret armament could not compensate for, and this was at a time when British fighters were flying with 8 machine guns, while German fighters carried fewer machine guns but were also armed with automatic cannons.\n\nAttempts to put this heavier armament, such as multiple [[20 mm caliber|20&nbsp;mm cannon]] in low profile aerodynamic turrets were [[Boulton Paul P.92|explored by the British]] but were not successful, this class of weapons and heavier armament (up to and including artillery pieces as in the 1,420 examples produced of the American [[B-25 Mitchell#Variants|B-25G and B-25H Mitchell]] medium bombers, and the experimental [[De Havilland Mosquito|'Tsetse']] variant of the de Haviland Mosquito) being exclusively fuselage or underwing-mounted and thus aimed by pointing the aircraft as a whole.\n\nNot all turret designs put the gunner in the turret along with the armament: US and German-designed aircraft both featured remote-controlled turrets.\n\n[[File:B-17G Nose in Detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]'s Bendix chin turret, remotely controlled by the bombardier.]]\nIn the US, the large, purpose-built [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]] [[night fighter]] was produced with a remotely operated [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow#Remote turret|dorsal turret]] that had a wide range of fire though in practice it was generally fired directly forward under control of the pilot. For the last Douglas-built production blocks of the B-17F (the \"B-17F-xx-DL\" designated blocks), and for all versions of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17G Flying Fortress]] a twin-gun remotely operated \"chin\" turret, designed by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] and first used on the experimental [[YB-40 Flying Fortress|YB-40]] \"gunship\" version of the Fortress, was added to give more forward defence. Specifically designed to be compact and not obstruct the bombardier, this was operated by a swing-away diagonal column possessing a yoke<ref>[http://www.lonesentry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/controller-operation-chin-turret.jpg Graphic of usage and stowage positions for B-17G chin turret control yoke]</ref> to traverse the turret, and aimed by a reflector sight mounted in the windscreen.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-445-1861-19, Nordafrika, Arbeit an Bordwaffen einer Me 210-410.jpg|thumb|right|One of the FDSL 131 remote gun turrets of a [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] being maintained, with cover removed.]]\n\nThe intended replacement for the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] heavy fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 210]], possessed twin half-teardrop-shaped, remotely operated ''Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette'' FDSL 131/1B turrets, one on each side \"flank\" of the rear fuselage to defend the rear of the aircraft, controlled from the rear area of the cockpit. By 1942, the German [[Heinkel He 177|He 177A ''Greif'']] heavy bomber would feature a ''Fernbedienbare Drehlafette'' FDL 131Z remotely operated forward dorsal turret, armed with twin 13mm [[MG 131 machine gun]]s on the top of the fuselage, which was operated from [[Astrodome (aeronautics)|a hemispherical, clear rotating \"astrodome\"]] just behind the cockpit glazing and offset to starboard atop the fuselage\u2014a second, manned powered ''Hydraulische Drehlafette'' HDL 131 dorsal turret, further aft on the fuselage with a single MG 131 was also used on most examples.\n\nThe US B-29 Superfortress had four remote controlled turrets, comprising two dorsal and two ventral turrets. These were controlled from a trio of hemispherically glazed gunner-manned \"astrodome\" sighting stations operated from the pressurised sections in the nose and middle of the aircraft, each housing an [[altazimuth mount]]ed pivoting gunsight to aim one or more of the unmanned remote turrets as needed, in addition to a B-17 style flexible manned tail gunner's station.\n\nThe defensive turret on bombers fell from favour with the realization that bombers could not attempt heavily defended targets without escort regardless of their defensive armament unless very high loss rates were acceptable, and the performance penalty from the weight and drag of turrets reduced speed, range and payload and increased the number of crew required. The already mentioned British [[de Havilland Mosquito]] light bomber was designed to operate without ''any'' defensive armament and used its speed to avoid engagement with fighters, much as the minimally armed German ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' aircraft concepts had been meant to do early in World War II.\n\nA small number of aircraft continued to use turrets however\u2014in particular maritime patrol aircraft such as the [[Avro Shackleton]] used one as an offensive weapon against small unarmoured surface targets. The [[Boeing B-52]] jet bomber and many of its contemporaries (particularly Russian) featured a [[barbette]] (a [[British English]] term equivalent to the American usage of the term 'tail gun'), or a \"remote turret\"\u2014an unmanned turret but often one with a more limited field of fire than a manned equivalent.\n\n===Layout===\nAircraft carry their turrets in various locations:\n\n*\"dorsal\" \u2013 on top of the [[fuselage]], sometimes referred to as a mid-upper turret.\n*\"ventral\" \u2013 underneath the fuselage, often on US heavy bombers, a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]]-designed [[ball turret]].\n*\"rear\" or \"tail\" \u2013 at the very end of the fuselage.\n*\"nose\" \u2013 at the front of the fuselage.\n*\"cheek\" \u2013 on the flanks of the nose, as single-gun flexible defensive mounts for B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers\n*\"chin\" \u2013 below the nose of the aircraft as on later versions of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].\n*\"wing\" \u2013 a handful of very large aircraft, such as the [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] and the [[Blohm & Voss BV 222]], had manned turrets in the wings\n*\"waist\" or \"beam\" \u2013 mounted on the sides of the rear fuselage e.g. US twin- and four-engined bombers.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery>\nFile:34bg-b24.jpg|[[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24J Liberator]] nose turret\nFile:Grumman TBM-3E Avenger HB-RDG OTT 2103 13.jpg|Dorsal gun turret on a [[Grumman TBM Avenger]]\nFile:B29 ventral turret.jpg|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] remote controlled aft ventral turret\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7197-16, Reichsgebiet, Flugzeug Me 323 Gigant.jpg|Wing turrets of an Me 323\nFile:Lancaster tail turret.jpg|[[Avro Lancaster]] tail turret\nFile:B52 tail turret.jpg|The tail turret or \"[[barbette#Use in bomber aircraft|barbette]]\" of a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Combat vehicles==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Armoured Car Bardia 1940.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]] with its new open-topped turret, 1940.]]\nAmongst the first armoured vehicles to be equipped with a gun turret were the [[Lanchester 4x2 Armoured Car|Lanchester]] and [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s, both produced from 1914. The [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) raised the first British [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] squadron during the [[First World War]].<ref>''First World War''. Willmott, H.P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, p. 59</ref> In September 1914 all available [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] ''[[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost|Silver Ghost]]'' chassis were requisitioned to form the basis for the new armoured car. The following month a special committee of the [[Admiralty]] [[Air Department]], among whom was Flight Commander T.G. Hetherington, designed the superstructure which consisted of armoured bodywork and a single fully rotating turret holding a regular water cooled [[Vickers machine gun]].\n\nHowever, the first [[Continuous track|tracked]] [[combat vehicle]]s were not equipped with turrets due to the problems with getting sufficient trench crossing while keeping the centre of gravity low, and it was not until late in [[World War I]] that the French [[Renault FT]] light tank introduced the single fully rotating turret carrying the vehicle's main armament that continues to be the standard of almost every modern main battle [[tank]] and many post-World War II [[self-propelled gun]]s. The first turret designed for the FT was a circular, cast steel version almost identical to that of the prototype. It was designed to carry a [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss 8mm machine gun]]. Meanwhile, the [[Berliet]] Company produced a new design, a polygonal turret of riveted plate, which was simpler to produce than the early cast steel turret. It was given the name \"omnibus\", since it could easily be adapted to mount either the Hotchkiss machine gun or the Puteaux 37mm with its telescopic sight. This turret was fitted to production models in large numbers.\n\nIn the 1930s, several nations produced [[:Category:multi-turreted tanks|multi-turreted tanks]]\u2014probably influenced by the experimental British [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] of 1926. Those that saw combat during the early part of [[World War II]] performed poorly and the concept was soon dropped. Combat vehicles without turrets, with the main armament mounted in the hull, or more often in a completely enclosed, integral armored [[casemate]] as part of the main hull, saw extensive use by both the German (as ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' and ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' vehicles) and Soviet (as ''[[Samokhodnaya Ustanovka]]'' vehicles) armored forces during World War II as [[tank destroyer]]s and [[assault gun]]s. However, post-war, the concept fell out of favour due to its limitations, with the Swedish [[Stridsvagn 103]] 'S-Tank' and the German [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]] being exceptions.\n\n{{Use Canadian English|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|right|US Army tank troops with [[Renault FT]]s on the Western Front, 1918. The FT was the first operational tank to carry a turret.]]\nIn modern tanks, the turret is armoured for crew protection and rotates a full 360 degrees carrying a single large-calibre [[tank gun]], typically in the range of 105&nbsp;mm to 125&nbsp;mm calibre. [[Machine gun]]s may be mounted inside the turret, which on modern tanks is often on a \"coaxial\" mount, parallel with the larger main gun.\n\nEarly designs often featured multiple weapons mounts, and this concept was carried forwards into the early interwar years in Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union, arguably reaching its most absurd expression in the British [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] tank, though this attempt was soon abandoned while the Soviet Union's similar effort produced a [[T-35|'land battleship' which was actually produced and fought in defence of the Soviet Union]].\n\nIn modern tanks, the turret houses all the crew except the driver (who is located in the hull). The crew located in the turret typically consist of tank commander, gunner, and often a gun loader (except in tanks that have an automated loading mechanism), while the driver sits in a separate compartment with a dedicated entry and exit, though often one that allows the driver to exit via the turret basket (fighting compartment).\n\nFor other combat vehicles, the turrets are equipped with other weapons dependent on role. An [[infantry fighting vehicle]] may carry a smaller calibre gun or an  [[autocannon]], or an [[anti-tank]] missile launcher, or a combination of weapons. A modern self-propelled gun mounts a large artillery gun but less armour. Lighter vehicles may carry a one-man turret with a single machine gun, occasionally the same model being shared with other classes of vehicle, such as the [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Cadillac Gage]] T50 turret/weapons station.\n\nThe size of the turret is a factor in combat vehicle design. One dimension mentioned in terms of turret design is  \"turret ring diameter\" which is the size of the aperture in the top of the chassis into which the turret is seated.\n\n==Land fortifications==\nIn 1859, the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] were in the process of recommending a huge programme of [[fortification]]s to protect Britain's naval bases. They interviewed Captain Coles, who had bombarded Russian fortifications during the [[Crimean War]], however Coles repeatedly lost his temper during the discussion and the commissioners failed to ask him about the gun turret that he had patented earlier in that year, with the result that none of the [[Palmerston Forts]] mounted turrets.<ref>Crick, Timothy (2012) Ramparts of Empire: The Fortifications of Sir William Jervois, Royal Engineer 1821\u20131897, University of Exeter Press, {{ISBN|978-1-905816-04-0}}. pp. 46\u201347</ref>  Eventually, the [[Admiralty Pier Turret]] at [[Dover]] was commissioned in 1877 and completed in 1882.\n\nIn continental Europe, the invention of [[high explosive]] shells in 1885 threatened to make all existing fortifications obsolete; a partial solution was the protection of fortress guns in armoured turrets. Pioneering designs were produced by Commandant [[Henri-Louis-Philippe Mougin]] in France and Captain [[Maximilian Schumann]] in Germany. Mougin's designs were incorporated in a new generation of [[polygonal fort]]s constructed by [[Raymond Adolphe S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res]] in France and [[Henri Alexis Brialmont]] in Belgium.

Loading of ammunition is also often done by automatic mechanisms.]]\n\nA '''gun turret''' (or simply '''turret''') is a platform from which weapons can be fired that affords protection, visibility and some cone of fire.  A modern gun turret is generally a rotatable [[weapon mount]] that houses the crew or [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] of a [[artillery|projectile-firing weapon]] and at the same time lets the weapon be aimed and fired in some degree of [[azimuth]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] (cone of fire).\n\n== Description ==\nRotating gun turrets protect the weapon and its crew as they rotate.  When this meaning of the word \"turret\" started being used at the beginning of the 1860s, turrets were normally cylindrical.   [[Barbettes]] were an alternative to turrets; with a barbette the protection was fixed, and the weapon and crew were on a rotating platform inside the barbette.  In the 1890s, armoured hoods (also known as \"gun houses\") were added to barbettes; these rotated with the platform (hence the term \"hooded barbette\").  By the early 20th Century, these hoods were known as turrets.  Modern warships have gun-mountings described as turrets, though the \"protection\" on them is limited to protection from the weather.\n\nRotating turrets can be mounted on a [[fortification|fortified]] [[building]] or [[structure]] such as a coastal blockhouse, be part of a [[land battery]], be mounted on a [[combat vehicle]], a [[naval ship]], or a [[military aviation|military aircraft]], they may be armed with one or more [[machine gun]]s, [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]], large-[[caliber|calibre]] guns, or [[Multiple rocket launcher|missile launcher]]s. They may be manned or [[Remote weapon station|remotely controlled]] and are most often protected to some degree, if not actually [[vehicle armour|armoured]].\n\nThe protection provided by the turret may be against battle damage, the weather conditions, general environment in which the weapon or its crew will be operating. The name derives from the pre-existing noun [[turret]], from the French \"touret\", diminutive of the word \"tower\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Turret n. |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/turret |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> meaning ''a self-contained protective position which is situated on top of a fortification or defensive wall'' as opposed to rising directly from the ground, in which case it constitutes a [[tower]].\n\n=== Cupolas ===\n[[File:Conqueror cupola, Bovington Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|The commander's cupola of a [[Conqueror tank]] with a machine gun.]]\n\n{{anchor|Cupola}}\n\nA small turret, or sub-turret set on top of a larger one, is called a '''cupola'''. The term ''cupola'' is also used for a rotating turret that carries a sighting device rather than weaponry, such as that used by a [[tank]] commander.{{efn-lr|name=Cupola|In architecture, a [[cupola]] is a small, most often dome-like, structure on top of a building, so although it is often used to describe a sub-turret such as commander's sub-turret on a tank turret, if a gun turret is mounted on a vessel or above a bunker and is dome shaped it too may be referred to as a cupola in some sources.}}\n\n== Warships ==\nBefore the development of large-calibre, long-range guns in the mid-19th century, the classic [[battleship]] design{{efn-lr|See [[box battery]] and [[central battery ship]]}} used rows of gunport-mounted guns on each side of the ship, often mounted in [[casemate]]s. Firepower was provided by a large number of guns, each of which could traverse only in a limited arc. Due to stability issues, fewer large (and thus heavy) guns can be carried high on a ship, but as this set casemates low and thus near the waterline they were vulnerable to flooding, effectively restricted their use to calm seas. Additionally casemate mounts had to be recessed into the side of a vessel to afford a wide arc of fire, and such recesses presented [[shot trap]]s, compromising the integrity of armour plating.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}\n\nRotating turrets were [[weapon mount]]s designed to protect the crew and mechanism of the [[artillery|artillery piece]] and with the capability of being aimed and fired over a broad arc, typically between a three-quarter circle up to and including a full 360 degrees. These presented the opportunity to concentrate firepower in fewer, better-sited positions by eliminating redundancy, in other words combining the firepower of those guns unable to engage an enemy because they sited on the wrong beam into a more powerful, and more versatile unified battery.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Gun or Mortar cask raft and proposed Cupola ship.png|thumb|left|Captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles|Cowper Coles']] proposed cupola ship, 1860.]]\n[[File:BEP-(unk)-In the Turret.jpg|thumb|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|vignette]] ''In the Turret'' (engraved before 1863).]]\n\nDesigns for a rotating gun turret date back to the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-KbN-xWTj7kC&pg=PT36&dq=Gillespie+Turret+1805#v=onepage&q=Gillespie+Turret+1805&f=false|title=Duel Between the First Ironclads|first=William C.|last=Davis|date=9 May 2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|accessdate=29 May 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780307817501}}</ref> In the mid 19th century, during the [[Crimean War]], Captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles]] constructed a [[raft]] with guns protected by a 'cupola' and used the raft,{{efn-lr|name=Cupola}} named the [[Siege of Taganrog|''Lady Nancy'']], to shell the Russian town of [[Taganrog]] in the [[Black Sea]].

Coles enlisted the support of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who wrote to the first Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Somerset, supporting the construction of a turret ship. In January 1862, the Admiralty agreed to construct a ship, [[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']] which had four turrets and a low freeboard, intended only for coastal defence.\n\n[[File:HMS Prince Albert (1864).jpg|thumb|[[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']], a pioneering turret ship, whose turrets were designed by [[Cowper Phipps Coles]].]]\nWhile Coles designed the turrets, the ship was the responsibility of Chief Constructor [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]].<ref name=\"Barnaby\" /> Another ship using Coles' turret designs, {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1857|6}}, was completed in August 1864.

An [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[turret ship]] designed by [[Edward James Reed]], she was equipped with revolving turrets that used pioneering hydraulic turret machinery to maneouvre the guns. She was also the world's first mastless [[battleship]], built with a central [[superstructure]] layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships. With her sister {{HMS|Devastation|1871|6}} of 1871 she was another pivotal design, and led directly to the modern battleship.\n\n[[File:USS Georgia turret.tiff|thumb|left|Superposed turrets on {{USS|Georgia|BB-15|6}}]]\n\nThe US Navy tried to save weight and allow the much faster firing [[8\"/45 caliber gun|8-inch]] to shoot during the long reload time necessary for [[12\"/40 caliber gun|12-inch]] guns by superposing secondary gun turrets directly on top of the primary turrets (as in the {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|2}}s), but the idea proved to be practically unworkable and was soon abandoned.{{efn-lr|Something similar occurred in American armoured vehicle designs around the time of the Second World War, tanks sprouting 'superfiring' turrets including the [[M3 Grant|M3 Lee]] and [[M60 Patton|M60A2 Patton]]. Given they were generally intended for an already-overburdened commander to operate, they have largely been abandoned in favour of literally lower-profile arrangements for protected observation with, in some cases, top-mounted remotely-operated weapons.}}\n\nWith the advent of the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|2}}s in 1908, the main battery turrets were designed so as to [[superfire]], to improve fire arcs on centerline mounted weapons. This was necessitated by a need to move all main battery turrets to the vessel's centerline for improved structural support. The 1906 {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, while revolutionary in many other ways, had retained [[Gun turret#Wing turrets|wing turret]]s due to concerns about muzzle blast affecting the sighting mechanisms of a turret below. A similar advancement was in the {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|2}}s and {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s, which dispensed with the \"Q\" turret amidships in favour of heavier guns in fewer mountings.\n\n[[File:Quadruple gun mounting in 24 Shop, Elswick Works (26345255273).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|King George V|41|6}} four-gun turret]]\n\nLike [[pre-dreadnought]]s, the first dreadnoughts had two guns in each turret; however, later ships began to be fitted with triple turrets. The first ship to be built with triple turrets was the Italian {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}}, although the first to be actually commissioned was the Austro-Hungarian {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} of the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}. By the beginning of [[World War II]], most battleships used triple or, occasionally, quadruple turrets, which reduced the total number of mountings and improved armour protection. However, quadruple turrets proved to be extremely complex to arrange, making them unwieldy in practice.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck''{{'}}s secondary battery 15&nbsp;cm gun turret]]\n\nThe largest warship turrets were in World War II battleships where a heavily armoured enclosure protected the large gun crew during battle. The calibre of the main armament on large battleships was typically {{convert|300|to|460|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The turrets carrying three 460&nbsp;mm guns of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} each weighed around 2,500 tonnes. The secondary armament of battleships (or the primary armament of [[light cruiser]]s) was typically between {{convert|127|and|152|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Smaller ships typically mounted guns from {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} upwards, although these rarely required a turret mounting, except for large destroyers, like the American {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|5}} and the German [[Type 1936A-class destroyer|''Narvik'']] classes.\n\n=== Layout ===\n[[File:Animated gun turret.gif|thumb|250px|right|Animation showing gun turret operation of the Stark I turret of the British [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun]]. Compare the layout and nomenclature with the US design below.]]\n[[File:Iowa 16 inch Gun-EN.svg|thumb|350px|right|Cutaway illustration of a US [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] turret]]\n\nIn naval terms, ''turret'' traditionally and specifically refers to a gun mounting where the entire mass rotates as one, and has a trunk that projects below the [[deck (ship)|deck]]. The rotating part of a turret seen above deck is the gunhouse, which protects the mechanism and crew, and is where the guns are loaded. The gunhouse is supported on a bed of rotating rollers, and is not necessarily physically attached to the ship at the base of the rotating structure.  In the case of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']], the turrets were not vertically restrained and fell out when she sank.  The [[HMS Hood|British battlecruiser ''Hood'']], like some American battleships, did have vertical restraints.<ref>{{citation|title=A Marine Forensic Analysis of HMS Hood and DKM Bismarck|first1= William|last1= Jurens |first2=William H |last2=Garzke Jr|first3=Robert O|last3= Dulin Jr|first4= John |last4=Roberts|first5=Richard |last5=Fiske |page=14|citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.317}}</ref>\n\nBelow the gunhouse there may be a working chamber, where ammunition is handled, and the main trunk, which accommodates the [[shell (projectile)|shell]] and [[propellant]] hoists that bring ammunition up from the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] below. There may be a combined hoist (''cf'' the animated British turret) or separate hoists (''cf'' the US turret cutaway). The working chamber and trunk rotate with the gunhouse, and sit inside a protective [[vehicle armour|armoured]] [[barbette]]. The barbette extends down to the main armoured deck (red in the animation). At the base of the turret sit handing rooms, where shell and propelling charges are passed from the shell room and magazine to the hoists.\n\nThe handling equipment and hoists are complex arrangements of machinery that transport the shells and charges from the magazine into the base of the turret. Bearing in mind that shells can weigh around a [[long ton|ton]], the hoists have to be powerful and rapid; a 15-inch turret of the type in the animation was expected to perform a complete loading and firing cycle in a minute.<ref>Capt. S. W. Roskill, RN, HMS ''Warspite'', Classics of Naval Literature, Naval Institute Press, 1997 {{ISBN|1-55750-719-8}}</ref>\n\nThe loading system is fitted with a series of [[interlock (engineering)|mechanical interlocks]] that ensure that there is never an open path from the gunhouse to the magazine down which an [[Explosives#Sensitivity|explosive flash]] might pass. Flash-tight doors and scuttles open and close to allow the passage between areas of the turret. Generally, with large-calibre guns, powered or assisted ramming is required to force the heavy shell and charge into the [[breech-loading weapon|breech]].\n\nAs the hoist and breech must be aligned for ramming to occur, there is generally a restricted range of elevations at which the guns can be loaded; the guns return to the loading elevation, are loaded, then return to the target elevation, at which time they are said to be \"in battery\". The animation illustrates a turret where the rammer is fixed to the cradle that carries the guns, allowing loading to occur across a wider range of elevations.\n\nEarlier turrets differed significantly in their operating principles. It was not until the last of the \"rotating drum\" designs described in the previous section were phased out that the \"hooded barbette\" arrangement above became the standard.\n\n=== Wing turrets ===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|right|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] had a main battery 12&nbsp;inch wing turret on either beam.]]\nA '''wing turret''' is a gun turret mounted along the side, or the wings, of a [[warship]], off the centerline.\n\nThe positioning of a wing turret limits the gun's arc of fire, so that it generally can contribute to only the [[broadside]] weight of fire on one side of the ship. This is the major weakness of wing turrets as broadsides were the most prevalent type of gunnery duels. Depending on the configurations of ships, such as HMS ''Dreadnought'' but not {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher}}, the wing turrets could fire fore and aft, so this somewhat reduced the danger when an opponent [[crossing the T|crossed the T]] enabling it to fire a full broadside.\n\n[[File:SMS Von der Tann Brassey's 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of the  battlecruiser ''Von der Tann'', Brassey's ''Naval Annual'' 1913, showing wing turrets amidships.]]\n\nAttempts were made to mount '''turrets ''en echelon''''' so that they could fire on either beam, such as the {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|0}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann}} [[battlecruiser]]s, but this tended to cause great damage to the ships' deck from the muzzle blast.\n\n[[File:Klasa radetzky.png|thumb|right|The pre-dreadnought battleship {{SMS|Radetzky}} with two main gun turrets on centreline and four secondary on the sides]]\n\nWing turrets were commonplace on [[capital ship]]s and [[cruiser]]s during the late 19th century up until the early 1910s. In [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, the wing turret contributed to the [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of sub-calibre weapons. In large [[armoured cruiser]]s, wing turrets contributed to the main battery, although the [[casemate]] mounting was more common. At the time, large numbers of smaller calibre guns contributing to the broadside were thought to be of great value in demolishing a ship's upperworks and secondary armaments, as distances of battle were limited by fire control and weapon performance.\n\nIn the early 1900s, weapon performance, [[vehicle armour|armour quality]] and vessel speeds generally increased along with the distances of engagement; the utility of large secondary batteries reducing as a consequence, and in addition at extreme range it was impossible to see the fall of lesser weapons and so correct the aim. Therefore, most early [[dreadnought battleship]]s featured \"all big gun\" armaments of identical calibre, typically 11 or 12&nbsp;inches, some of which were mounted in wing turrets. This arrangement was not satisfactory, however, as the wing turrets not only had a reduced fire arc for broadsides, but also because the weight of the guns put great strain on the hull and it was increasingly difficult to properly armour them.\n\nLarger and later dreadnought battleships carried superimposed or superfiring turrets (i.e. one turret mounted higher than and firing over those in front of and below it). This allowed all turrets to train on either beam, and increased the weight of fire forward and aft. The superfiring or superimposed arrangement had not been proven until after ''South Carolina'' went to sea, and it was initially feared that the weakness of the previous {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|0}} ship's stacked turrets would repeat itself. Larger and later guns (such as the US Navy's ultimate big gun design, the [[16\"/50 Mark 7]]) also could not be shipped in wing turrets, as the strain on the hull would have been too great.\n\n===Modern turrets===\n[[File:HMS Northumberland (F238) at West India South Dock - 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun 02.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Glass-reinforced plastic|GRP]] gunhouse is a common feature on modern naval gun turrets, this example being on the frigate {{HMS|Northumberland|F238|6}}.]]\n\nMany modern surface warships have mountings for large calibre guns, although the calibres are now generally between {{convert|3|and|5|in}}. The gunhouses are often just weatherproof covers for the gun mounting equipment and are made of light un-armoured materials such as [[glass-reinforced plastic]]. Modern turrets are often automatic in their operation, with no humans working inside them and only a small team passing fixed ammunition into the feed system. Smaller calibre weapons often operate on the [[autocannon]] principle, and indeed may not even be turrets at all; they may just be bolted directly to the deck.\n\n=== Turret identification ===\nOn board warships, each turret is given an identification. In the British [[Royal Navy]], these would be letters: \"A\" and \"B\" were for the turrets from the front of the ship backwards in front of the bridge, and letters near the end of the alphabet (i.e., \"X\", \"Y\", etc.) were for turrets behind the bridge ship, \"Y\" being the rearmost. Mountings in the middle of the ship would be \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", etc.<ref>{{cite book |last =Keegan |first =John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =[https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 281] |isbn =978-0-670-81416-9 |url-access =registration |url =https://archive.org/details/priceofadmiralty00keeg/page/281 }}</ref> Confusingly, the {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser}}s had a \"Q\" and the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship}}s had an \"X\" turret in what would logically be \"C\" position; the latter being mounted at the main deck level in front of the bridge and behind the \"B\" turret, thus having restricted training fore and aft.{{efn-lr|The ''Nelson'' design was an adaption of an earlier planned battleship with two turrets before the bridge and a single one behind the bridge but in front of the aft superstructure.}}\n\nSecondary turrets were named \"P\" and \"S\" ([[Port (nautical)|port]] and [[starboard]]) and numbered from fore to aft, e.g. ''P1'' being the forward port turret.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nExceptions were of course made; the battleship [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|HMS ''Agincourt'']] had the uniquely large number of seven turrets. These were numbered \"1\" to \"7\" but were unofficially nicknamed \"Sunday\", Monday\", etc. through to \"Saturday\".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn German use, turrets were generally named \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", going from bow to stern. Usually the [[radio alphabet]] was used on naming the turrets (e.g. \"Anton\", \"Bruno\" or \"Berta\", \"Caesar\", \"Dora\") as on the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn the [[United States Navy]], turrets are numbered [[Bow (ship)|fore]] to [[aft]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Aircraft==\n\n===History===\n\nDuring World War I, [[air gunner]]s initially operated guns that were mounted on pedestals or swivel mounts known as [[Weapon mount#Pintle|pintle]]s.  The latter evolved into the [[Scarff ring]], a rotating ring mount which allowed the gun to be turned to any direction with the gunner remaining directly behind it, the weapon held in an intermediate elevation by [[bungee cord]], a simple and effective mounting for single weapons such as the [[Lewis gun|Lewis Gun]] though less handy when twin mounted as with the British [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] and German [[Idflieg aircraft designation system#List of Idflieg class letter prefixes|\"CL\"-class two-seaters]] such as the [[Halberstadt CL.II|Halberstadt]] and [[Hannover CL.II|Hannover]]-designed series of compact two-seat combat aircraft. In a failed 1916 experiment, a variant of the [[SPAD S.A]] two-seat fighter was probably the first aircraft to be fitted with a remotely-controlled gun, which was located in a nose [[nacelle]].\n\nAs aircraft flew higher and faster, the need for protection from the elements led to the enclosure or shielding of the gun positions, as in the \"lobsterback\" rear seat of the [[Hawker Demon]] biplane fighter.\n\n[[File:BP Overstrand.jpg|thumb|The [[Boulton & Paul Overstrand]] biplane was the first RAF bomber to carry an enclosed turret.]]\n\nThe first British operational bomber to carry an enclosed, power-operated turret was the British [[Boulton & Paul Overstrand]] twin-engined biplane, which first flew in 1933. The Overstrand was similar to its [[First World War]] predecessors in that it had open [[cockpit]]s and hand-operated defensive machine guns.<ref>Claus Reuter, ''Development of Aircraft Turrets in the AAF, 1917\u20131944'', Scarborough, Ont., German Canadian Museum of Applied History, 2000 p. 11.</ref> However, unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h) making operating the exposed gun positions difficult, particularly in the aircraft's nose. To overcome this problem, the Overstrand was fitted with an enclosed and powered [[nose turret]], mounting a single [[Lewis gun]]. As such the Overstrand was the first British aircraft to have a power-operated turret. Rotation was handled by [[pneumatic]] motors while elevation and depression of the gun used [[hydraulic]] rams. The pilot's cockpit was also enclosed but the dorsal (upper) and ventral (belly) gun positions remained open, though shielded.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202850.html The Overstrand's Turret] ''Flight'' 1936</ref>\n\n[[File:Martin YB-10.jpg|thumb|right|A Martin YB-10 service test bomber with the USAAC - the first flight of the B-10 design occurred in mid-February 1932.]]\nThe [[Martin B-10]] all-metal [[monocoque]] monoplane bomber introduced turret-mounted defensive armament within the [[United States Army Air Corps]], almost simultaneously with the RAF's Overstrand biplane bomber design. The Martin XB-10 prototype aircraft first featured the nose turret in June 1932\u2014roughly a year ''before'' the less advanced Overstrand airframe design\u2014and was first produced as the YB-10 service test version by November 1933. The production B-10B version started service with the USAAC in July 1935.\n\n[[File:Pima Air & Space Museum - Aircraft 11.JPG|thumb|right|A B-24 Liberator rear turret.]]\n\nIn time the number of turrets carried and the number of guns mounted increased. RAF heavy bombers of World War II such as the [[Handley Page Halifax]] (until its [[Handley Page Halifax#Improvements|Mk II Series I (Special) version]] omitted the nose turret), [[Short Stirling]] and [[Avro Lancaster]]  typically had three powered turrets: rear, mid-upper and nose. (Early in the war, some British heavy bombers also featured a retractable, remotely-operated [[ventral turret|ventral]] (or mid-under) turret). The rear turret mounted the heaviest armament: four [[.303 British|0.303&nbsp;inch]] [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] or, late in the war, two AN/M2 light-barrel versions of the US [[Browning M2 machine gun]] as in the [[Rose turret|Rose-Rice turret]]. The [[tail gunner]] or \"Tail End Charlie\" position was generally accepted to be the most dangerous assignment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the World War II era, British turrets were largely self-contained units, manufactured by [[Boulton Paul Aircraft]] and [[Nash & Thompson]]. The same model of turret might be fitted to several different aircraft types.\nSome models included [[Automatic Gun-Laying Turret|gun-laying radar]] that could [[Deflection (military)|lead]] the target and compensate for [[bullet drop]].\n\nAs almost a 1930s \"updated\" adaptation of the earlier Bristol F.2's concept, the UK introduced the concept of the \"turret fighter\", with aeroplanes such as the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]] and [[Blackburn Roc]] where the armament (four 0.303 inch) machineguns was in a turret mounted behind the pilot, rather than in fixed positions in the wings. The Defiant and Roc possessed no fixed, forward-firing automatic ordnance; the World War I-era Bristol F.2 was designed with one synchronized [[Vickers machine gun]] firing forward on a fuselage mount.\n\nThe concept came at a time when the standard armament of a fighter was only two machine guns and in the face of heavily armed bombers operating in formation, it was thought that a group of turret fighters would be able to concentrate their fire flexibly on the bombers; making beam, stern and rising attacks practicable. Although the idea had some merits in attacking bombers it made the turret fighter a sitting duck when facing fighters: the weight and drag penalty of the turret (and gunner) so reduced the power to weight ratio they operated at a huge disadvantage, one the theoretical flexibility of the turret armament could not compensate for, and this was at a time when British fighters were flying with 8 machine guns, while German fighters carried fewer machine guns but were also armed with automatic cannons.\n\nAttempts to put this heavier armament, such as multiple [[20 mm caliber|20&nbsp;mm cannon]] in low profile aerodynamic turrets were [[Boulton Paul P.92|explored by the British]] but were not successful, this class of weapons and heavier armament (up to and including artillery pieces as in the 1,420 examples produced of the American [[B-25 Mitchell#Variants|B-25G and B-25H Mitchell]] medium bombers, and the experimental [[De Havilland Mosquito|'Tsetse']] variant of the de Haviland Mosquito) being exclusively fuselage or underwing-mounted and thus aimed by pointing the aircraft as a whole.\n\nNot all turret designs put the gunner in the turret along with the armament: US and German-designed aircraft both featured remote-controlled turrets.\n\n[[File:B-17G Nose in Detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]'s Bendix chin turret, remotely controlled by the bombardier.]]\nIn the US, the large, purpose-built [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]] [[night fighter]] was produced with a remotely operated [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow#Remote turret|dorsal turret]] that had a wide range of fire though in practice it was generally fired directly forward under control of the pilot. For the last Douglas-built production blocks of the B-17F (the \"B-17F-xx-DL\" designated blocks), and for all versions of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17G Flying Fortress]] a twin-gun remotely operated \"chin\" turret, designed by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] and first used on the experimental [[YB-40 Flying Fortress|YB-40]] \"gunship\" version of the Fortress, was added to give more forward defence. Specifically designed to be compact and not obstruct the bombardier, this was operated by a swing-away diagonal column possessing a yoke<ref>[http://www.lonesentry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/controller-operation-chin-turret.jpg Graphic of usage and stowage positions for B-17G chin turret control yoke]</ref> to traverse the turret, and aimed by a reflector sight mounted in the windscreen.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-445-1861-19, Nordafrika, Arbeit an Bordwaffen einer Me 210-410.jpg|thumb|right|One of the FDSL 131 remote gun turrets of a [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] being maintained, with cover removed.]]\n\nThe intended replacement for the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] heavy fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 210]], possessed twin half-teardrop-shaped, remotely operated ''Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette'' FDSL 131/1B turrets, one on each side \"flank\" of the rear fuselage to defend the rear of the aircraft, controlled from the rear area of the cockpit. By 1942, the German [[Heinkel He 177|He 177A ''Greif'']] heavy bomber would feature a ''Fernbedienbare Drehlafette'' FDL 131Z remotely operated forward dorsal turret, armed with twin 13mm [[MG 131 machine gun]]s on the top of the fuselage, which was operated from [[Astrodome (aeronautics)|a hemispherical, clear rotating \"astrodome\"]] just behind the cockpit glazing and offset to starboard atop the fuselage\u2014a second, manned powered ''Hydraulische Drehlafette'' HDL 131 dorsal turret, further aft on the fuselage with a single MG 131 was also used on most examples.\n\nThe US B-29 Superfortress had four remote controlled turrets, comprising two dorsal and two ventral turrets. These were controlled from a trio of hemispherically glazed gunner-manned \"astrodome\" sighting stations operated from the pressurised sections in the nose and middle of the aircraft, each housing an [[altazimuth mount]]ed pivoting gunsight to aim one or more of the unmanned remote turrets as needed, in addition to a B-17 style flexible manned tail gunner's station.\n\nThe defensive turret on bombers fell from favour with the realization that bombers could not attempt heavily defended targets without escort regardless of their defensive armament unless very high loss rates were acceptable, and the performance penalty from the weight and drag of turrets reduced speed, range and payload and increased the number of crew required. The already mentioned British [[de Havilland Mosquito]] light bomber was designed to operate without ''any'' defensive armament and used its speed to avoid engagement with fighters, much as the minimally armed German ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' aircraft concepts had been meant to do early in World War II.\n\nA small number of aircraft continued to use turrets however\u2014in particular maritime patrol aircraft such as the [[Avro Shackleton]] used one as an offensive weapon against small unarmoured surface targets. The [[Boeing B-52]] jet bomber and many of its contemporaries (particularly Russian) featured a [[barbette]] (a [[British English]] term equivalent to the American usage of the term 'tail gun'), or a \"remote turret\"\u2014an unmanned turret but often one with a more limited field of fire than a manned equivalent.\n\n===Layout===\nAircraft carry their turrets in various locations:\n\n*\"dorsal\" \u2013 on top of the [[fuselage]], sometimes referred to as a mid-upper turret.\n*\"ventral\" \u2013 underneath the fuselage, often on US heavy bombers, a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]]-designed [[ball turret]].\n*\"rear\" or \"tail\" \u2013 at the very end of the fuselage.\n*\"nose\" \u2013 at the front of the fuselage.\n*\"cheek\" \u2013 on the flanks of the nose, as single-gun flexible defensive mounts for B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers\n*\"chin\" \u2013 below the nose of the aircraft as on later versions of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].\n*\"wing\" \u2013 a handful of very large aircraft, such as the [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] and the [[Blohm & Voss BV 222]], had manned turrets in the wings\n*\"waist\" or \"beam\" \u2013 mounted on the sides of the rear fuselage e.g. US twin- and four-engined bombers.\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery>\nFile:34bg-b24.jpg|[[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24J Liberator]] nose turret\nFile:Grumman TBM-3E Avenger HB-RDG OTT 2103 13.jpg|Dorsal gun turret on a [[Grumman TBM Avenger]]\nFile:B29 ventral turret.jpg|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] remote controlled aft ventral turret\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7197-16, Reichsgebiet, Flugzeug Me 323 Gigant.jpg|Wing turrets of an Me 323\nFile:Lancaster tail turret.jpg|[[Avro Lancaster]] tail turret\nFile:B52 tail turret.jpg|The tail turret or \"[[barbette#Use in bomber aircraft|barbette]]\" of a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Combat vehicles==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Armoured Car Bardia 1940.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]] with its new open-topped turret, 1940.]]\nAmongst the first armoured vehicles to be equipped with a gun turret were the [[Lanchester 4x2 Armoured Car|Lanchester]] and [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s, both produced from 1914. The [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) raised the first British [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] squadron during the [[First World War]].<ref>''First World War''. Willmott, H.P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, p. 59</ref> In September 1914 all available [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] ''[[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost|Silver Ghost]]'' chassis were requisitioned to form the basis for the new armoured car. The following month a special committee of the [[Admiralty]] [[Air Department]], among whom was Flight Commander T.G. Hetherington, designed the superstructure which consisted of armoured bodywork and a single fully rotating turret holding a regular water cooled [[Vickers machine gun]].\n\nHowever, the first [[Continuous track|tracked]] [[combat vehicle]]s were not equipped with turrets due to the problems with getting sufficient trench crossing while keeping the centre of gravity low, and it was not until late in [[World War I]] that the French [[Renault FT]] light tank introduced the single fully rotating turret carrying the vehicle's main armament that continues to be the standard of almost every modern main battle [[tank]] and many post-World War II [[self-propelled gun]]s. The first turret designed for the FT was a circular, cast steel version almost identical to that of the prototype. It was designed to carry a [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss 8mm machine gun]]. Meanwhile, the [[Berliet]] Company produced a new design, a polygonal turret of riveted plate, which was simpler to produce than the early cast steel turret. It was given the name \"omnibus\", since it could easily be adapted to mount either the Hotchkiss machine gun or the Puteaux 37mm with its telescopic sight. This turret was fitted to production models in large numbers.\n\nIn the 1930s, several nations produced [[:Category:multi-turreted tanks|multi-turreted tanks]]\u2014probably influenced by the experimental British [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] of 1926. Those that saw combat during the early part of [[World War II]] performed poorly and the concept was soon dropped. Combat vehicles without turrets, with the main armament mounted in the hull, or more often in a completely enclosed, integral armored [[casemate]] as part of the main hull, saw extensive use by both the German (as ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' and ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' vehicles) and Soviet (as ''[[Samokhodnaya Ustanovka]]'' vehicles) armored forces during World War II as [[tank destroyer]]s and [[assault gun]]s. However, post-war, the concept fell out of favour due to its limitations, with the Swedish [[Stridsvagn 103]] 'S-Tank' and the German [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]] being exceptions.\n\n{{Use Canadian English|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|right|US Army tank troops with [[Renault FT]]s on the Western Front, 1918. The FT was the first operational tank to carry a turret.]]\nIn modern tanks, the turret is armoured for crew protection and rotates a full 360 degrees carrying a single large-calibre [[tank gun]], typically in the range of 105&nbsp;mm to 125&nbsp;mm calibre. [[Machine gun]]s may be mounted inside the turret, which on modern tanks is often on a \"coaxial\" mount, parallel with the larger main gun.\n\nEarly designs often featured multiple weapons mounts, and this concept was carried forwards into the early interwar years in Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union, arguably reaching its most absurd expression in the British [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] tank, though this attempt was soon abandoned while the Soviet Union's similar effort produced a [[T-35|'land battleship' which was actually produced and fought in defence of the Soviet Union]].\n\nIn modern tanks, the turret houses all the crew except the driver (who is located in the hull). The crew located in the turret typically consist of tank commander, gunner, and often a gun loader (except in tanks that have an automated loading mechanism), while the driver sits in a separate compartment with a dedicated entry and exit, though often one that allows the driver to exit via the turret basket (fighting compartment).\n\nFor other combat vehicles, the turrets are equipped with other weapons dependent on role. An [[infantry fighting vehicle]] may carry a smaller calibre gun or an  [[autocannon]], or an [[anti-tank]] missile launcher, or a combination of weapons. A modern self-propelled gun mounts a large artillery gun but less armour. Lighter vehicles may carry a one-man turret with a single machine gun, occasionally the same model being shared with other classes of vehicle, such as the [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Cadillac Gage]] T50 turret/weapons station.\n\nThe size of the turret is a factor in combat vehicle design. One dimension mentioned in terms of turret design is  \"turret ring diameter\" which is the size of the aperture in the top of the chassis into which the turret is seated.\n\n==Land fortifications==\nIn 1859, the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] were in the process of recommending a huge programme of [[fortification]]s to protect Britain's naval bases. They interviewed Captain Coles, who had bombarded Russian fortifications during the [[Crimean War]], however Coles repeatedly lost his temper during the discussion and the commissioners failed to ask him about the gun turret that he had patented earlier in that year, with the result that none of the [[Palmerston Forts]] mounted turrets.<ref>Crick, Timothy (2012) Ramparts of Empire: The Fortifications of Sir William Jervois, Royal Engineer 1821\u20131897, University of Exeter Press, {{ISBN|978-1-905816-04-0}}. pp. 46\u201347</ref>  Eventually, the [[Admiralty Pier Turret]] at [[Dover]] was commissioned in 1877 and completed in 1882.\n\nIn continental Europe, the invention of [[high explosive]] shells in 1885 threatened to make all existing fortifications obsolete; a partial solution was the protection of fortress guns in armoured turrets. Pioneering designs were produced by Commandant [[Henri-Louis-Philippe Mougin]] in France and Captain [[Maximilian Schumann]] in Germany. Mougin's designs were incorporated in a new generation of [[polygonal fort]]s constructed by [[Raymond Adolphe S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res]] in France and [[Henri Alexis Brialmont]] in Belgium.

An extreme example was [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]], the \"concrete battleship\", near [[Corregidor]], [[Philippines]]; this mounted four huge [[14\"/45 caliber gun|14-inch gun]]s in two naval pattern turrets and was the only permanent turreted fort ever constructed by the United States.<ref>Hogg. p. 116</ref> Between the wars, improved turrets formed the offensive armament of the [[Maginot Line]] forts in France. During the Second World War, some of the artillery pieces in the [[Atlantic Wall]] fortifications, such as the [[Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War|Cross-Channel guns]], were large naval guns housed in turrets. \n[[File:12 cm tornautomatpj\u00e4s m70.JPG|alt= 12&nbsp;cm automatic turret gun model 1970 also known as ERSTA (Ers\u00e4ttning Tungt Artilleri in English Replacement Heavy Artillery)|thumb|\n12&nbsp;cm automatic turret gun model 1970 also known as ERSTA (''Ers\u00e4ttning Tungt Artilleri'' or Replacement Heavy Artillery) developed to defend vital points like seaports from enemy landing ships, as well as area denial and fire support, even on a nuclear battlefield.\n]]\nSome nations, from [[Albania]] to Switzerland and Austria, have embedded the turrets of obsolete tanks in concrete bunkers, while others have constructed or updated fortifications with modern artillery systems, such as the [[12 cm tornautomatpj\u00e4s m/70|1970s era Swedish coastal artillery battery]] on [[Landsort|Landsort Island]].\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery>\nFile:DoverTurret2.jpg|The [[Admiralty Pier Turret]] was built to protect the port of [[Dover]] in 1882.\nFile:Forte de Copacabana 07.jpg|A German built 190&nbsp;mm gun turret at [[Fort Copacabana]] in Brazil, completed in 1914.\nFile:Maginot2ix.jpg|Turret of the [[Maginot Line]]; this could retract into the ground when not firing, for added protection.\nFile:305 52 O2 Kuivasaari.JPG|A twin 305&nbsp;mm gun turret at [[Kuivasaari]], Finland, completed in 1935.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-364-2314-16A, Atlantikwall, Batterie \"Lindemann\".jpg| One of three [[Adolf Gun|40.6cm guns]] at Batterie \"Lindemann\", a German [[Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War|Cross-Channel gun]].</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sponson]]\n* [[Barbette]]\n* [[Casemate]] \n* [[Remote weapon system]]\n* [[Gun shield]]\n* [[Gun mount]]\n* [[Gun carriage]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Gun turrets}}\n{{Commons category|Aircraft gun turrets}}\n{{Commons category|Military cupolas}}\n*[http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=wCcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=112&query=B-25 Air Gunnery] November 1943 [[Popular Science]] article on aircraft turrets\n*[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1940/1940%20-%201443.html ''Flight'' article on aircraft gun turrets amongst others]\n*[http://www.lonesentry.com/blog/bendix-chin-turret.html Lone Sentry's Bendix B-17 chin turret manual and details]\n\n{{Fortifications}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gun Turret}}\n[[Category:Weapon turrets]]\n[[Category:Projectile weapons]]\n[[Category:Fortification (architectural elements)]]\n", "name_user": "Heyheyit'smeboi", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(just fixed some stuff)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_turret"}

On June 10, 2003, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] issued a decision immediately legalizing [[same-sex marriage]] in Ontario, thereby becoming the first province where it was legal. The introduction of a federal gender-neutral marriage definition made [[Canada]] the fourth country in the world, and the first country outside [[Europe]], to legally recognize same-sex marriage throughout its borders. Before the federal recognition of same-sex marriage, court decisions had already introduced it in eight out of ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and one of three territories, whose residents collectively made up about 90% of Canada's population. More than 3,000 same-sex couples had already married in those areas before the ''Civil Marriage Act'' was passed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Canada passes bill to legalize gay marriage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/world/americas/29iht-web.0629canada.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 2005 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Most legal benefits commonly associated with [[marriage]] had been extended to cohabiting same-sex couples since 1999.\n\nThe ''Civil Marriage Act'' was introduced by Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[27th Canadian Ministry|minority government]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] on February 1, 2005, as ''Bill C-38''. It was passed by the House of Commons on June 28, 2005, by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] on July 19, 2005, and it received [[royal assent]] the following day. Following the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 election]], which was won by a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] minority government under new Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], the House of Commons defeated a motion to reopen the matter by a vote of 175 to 123 on December 7, 2006, effectively reaffirming the legislation. This was the third vote supporting same-sex marriage taken by three Parliaments under three prime ministers in three different years, as shown below.\n\n==Same-sex marriage by province/territory==\nSame-sex marriage was legally recognized in the provinces and territories as of the following dates:\n*June 10, 2003: [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]]\n*July 8, 2003: [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|British Columbia]]\n*March 19, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Quebec|Quebec]] (In 2002, the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] unanimously legalized [[civil union]]s for both same-sex and opposite-sex partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-84-36-2.html |title=Bill n\u00b084 : An Act instituting civil unions and establishing new rules of filiation |publisher=[[National Assembly of Quebec]] |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}</ref>)\n*July 14, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Yukon|Yukon]]\n*September 16, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Manitoba|Manitoba]]\n*September 24, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]]\n*November 5, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]]\n*December 21, 2004: [[Same-sex marriage in Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland and Labrador]]\n*June 23, 2005: [[Same-sex marriage in New Brunswick|New Brunswick]]\n*July 20, 2005 (''Civil Marriage Act''): [[Same-sex marriage in Alberta|Alberta]], [[Same-sex marriage in Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island]], [[Same-sex marriage in Nunavut|Nunavut]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]]\n\nNote that in some of these cases, some marriages were in fact legal at an earlier date (for example, an Ontario ruling held that marriages performed in January 2001 were legal when performed), but the legality was questioned. As of the given dates, the legality was authoritatively established.\n\nThe decision of the Ontario government to recognize two marriages that took place in [[Toronto]] on January 14, 2001, retroactively makes Canada the first country in the world to have a government-legitimized same-sex marriage (the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], which legalized same-sex marriage before Canada, had their first in April 2001 and June 2003, respectively).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/legal/ontario_case/cer300604.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701175222/http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/legal/ontario_case/cer300604.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2004 |title=First same-sex marriage in the world now recognized |work=Samesexmarriage.ca |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Map of Canada, same-sex marriage, pre July 2005, color adapt.svg|thumb|right|Provinces and territories with same-sex marriage before its nationwide legalization on July 20, 2005.\n{{legend|#002255|Permitted}}\n{{legend|#D40000|Did not permit}}]]\n\nSame-sex marriage was originally recognized by law as a result of cases in which courts in eight out of ten of Canada's provinces, and in one of its three territories, ruled existing bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Thereafter, many same-sex couples obtained marriage licences in those provinces; like opposite-sex couples, they did not need to be residents of any of those provinces to marry there.\n\nThe legal status of same-sex marriages in these jurisdictions created an unusual jurisdictional issue. According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], the definition of marriage is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government; this interpretation was upheld by a December 9, 2004, opinion of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] (''[[Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage]]''). Until July 20, 2005, the federal government had not yet passed a law redefining marriage to conform to recent court decisions. Until the passage of ''Bill C-38'', the previous definition of marriage remained binding in the four jurisdictions (two provinces, two territories) where courts had not yet ruled it unconstitutional, but void in the nine jurisdictions (eight provinces, one territory) where it had been successfully challenged before the courts. Before the enactment of federal legislation recognizing same-sex marriage, therefore, the application of federal marriage law differed depending on the province or territory.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court ruling, the role of precedent in [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]], and the overall legal climate, it was very likely that any challenges to legalize same-sex marriage in the remaining four jurisdictions would be successful as well. Federal lawyers had ceased to contest such cases,<ref name=\"Nova Scotia\" /> and only Alberta's Conservative provincial government remained officially opposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20041214.html |title=The Canadian Supreme Court's Same-Sex Marriage Decision: An Interesting Contrast to the United States's Law |work=Findlaw |accessdate=July 11, 2008}}</ref> Alberta Premier [[Ralph Klein]] threatened to invoke the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] to avoid having to comply with the ruling,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/klein-ralph/ |title=Ralph Klein: Alberta's populist premier |work=CBC News |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> which would have been constitutional but which had become politically unacceptable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Manfredi |first=Christopher P. |date=October 2003 |url=http://archive.irpp.org/po/archive/oct03/manfredi.pdf |title=Same-sex Marriage and the Notwithstanding Clause |work=Policy Options |publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn June 17, 2003, Liberal Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] announced that the government would present a bill, which would allow same-sex couples equal rights to marry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Melissa |last=Cheung |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/18/world/main559147.shtml |title=Canada Will Legalize Gay Marriage |work=CBS News |date=June 18, 2003 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/18/world/canadian-leaders-agree-to-propose-gay-marriage-law.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Canadian leaders agree to propose gay marriage law |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 18, 2003 |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |first=Clifford |last=Krauss}}</ref> A draft of what would become ''Bill C-38'' was released on July 17, 2003, by Liberal Justice Minister [[Martin Cauchon]].

H.]]'' [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3 that same-sex couples in Canada were entitled to receive many of the financial and legal benefits commonly associated with marriage. However, i is beautiful and this decision stopped short of giving them the right to full legal marriage. Most laws which affect couples are within provincial rather than federal jurisdiction. As a result, rights varied somewhat from province to province.\n\nOn January 14, 2001, Reverend [[Brent Hawkes]] forced the issue by performing two same-sex marriages, taking advantage of the fact that Ontario law authorizes him to perform marriages without a previous license, via the issuance of [[banns of marriage]]. The registrar refused to accept the records of marriage, and a lawsuit was commenced over whether the marriages were legally performed. In other provinces, lawsuits were launched seeking permission to marry.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, decisions in the superior trial courts of Ontario and Quebec held that the restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples was discriminatory and contrary to the equality clause of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights of Freedoms'', while the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] ruled oppositely. On May 1, 2003, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] reversed the superior court decision. \n*in Ontario: ''[[Halpern v Canada (AG)|Halpern v. Canada]] (Attorney General)'' 95 C.R.R. (2d) 1 (Ontario Superior Court, July 12, 2002)\n*in Quebec: ''Hendricks v. Quebec'' [2002] R.J.Q. 2506 (Quebec Superior Court, September 6, 2002)\n* in British Columbia: ''Barbeau v. British Columbia'' 2003 BCCA 251 (British Columbia Court of Appeal, May 1, 2003)\n\nThe courts in each case suspended the effect of the declarations of invalidity for two years, to allow the federal government to consider legislative responses to the rulings. However, on June 10, 2003, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] ruled on an appeal in the ''Halpern'' case. The court agreed with the lower court that the traditional definition of marriage was discriminatory and that same-sex marriage was legally permitted. However, unlike the previous three court decisions, the Court of Appeal did not suspend its decision to allow Parliament to consider the issue. Instead, it ruled that the 2001 marriages were legal and same-sex marriage was available throughout Ontario immediately: ''[[Halpern v Canada (AG)]]''.<ref name=\"Halpern_CA\">[https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2003/2003canlii26403/2003canlii26403.html?autocompleteStr=halpern&autocompletePos=1 ''Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)'', 2003 CanLII 26403 (Ont. CA).]</ref>\n\nThe federal government had appealed the trial decisions to the provincial courts of appeal, but following the decision on the Ontario Court of Appeal, Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien announced on June 17, 2003 that the federal government would not seek to appeal the decisions to the Supreme Court. Instead, it would propose a draft ''Civil Marriage Act'' and refer it to the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion.\n\n====Ontario decision====\n{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Ontario}}\n\nIn 2003, the couples in ''Halpern v. Canada'' appealed the decision, requesting that the decision take effect immediately instead of after a delay. On June 10, 2003, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] confirmed that current Canadian law on marriage violated the equality provisions in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in being restricted to heterosexual couples. The court did not allow the province any grace time to bring its laws in line with the ruling, making Ontario the first jurisdiction in [[North America]] to recognize same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Halpern_CA\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Lee |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2980250.stm |title=Ontario legalises gay marriage |work=BBC News |date=June 11, 2003 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> The city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples.

It read:<blockquote>\n#Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.\n#Nothing in this Act affects the freedom of officials of religious groups to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs.</blockquote>\n\nThe draft bill was subsequently referred to the Supreme Court; see below.\n\nOn September 16, 2003, a motion was brought to Parliament by the [[Canadian Alliance]] (now the Conservative Party) to once again reaffirm the heterosexual definition of marriage.

The court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6685653 |title=Canada Supreme Court rules for gay marriage |work=NBC News |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Debate prior to C-38's introduction===\nOn December 9, 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin indicated that the federal government would introduce legislation expanding marriage to same-sex couples.

For example, the [[Quran|Qur'an]] (7:80-81, 26:165) and the Bible (Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-27, I Timothy 1:9-10, etc.) are frequently interpreted to explicitly forbid [[homosexuality]]. (See related article, \"[[Homosexuality and religion]]\")\n\nHowever, some major religious groups spoke in favour of legalizing same-sex marriage.

Thereafter, many same-sex couples obtained marriage licences in those provinces; like opposite-sex couples, they did not need to be residents of any of those provinces to marry there.\n\nThe legal status of same-sex marriages in these jurisdictions created an unusual jurisdictional issue. According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], the definition of marriage is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government; this interpretation was upheld by a December 9, 2004, opinion of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] (''[[Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage]]''). Until July 20, 2005, the federal government had not yet passed a law redefining marriage to conform to recent court decisions. Until the passage of ''Bill C-38'', the previous definition of marriage remained binding in the four jurisdictions (two provinces, two territories) where courts had not yet ruled it unconstitutional, but void in the nine jurisdictions (eight provinces, one territory) where it had been successfully challenged before the courts. Before the enactment of federal legislation recognizing same-sex marriage, therefore, the application of federal marriage law differed depending on the province or territory.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court ruling, the role of precedent in [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]], and the overall legal climate, it was very likely that any challenges to legalize same-sex marriage in the remaining four jurisdictions would be successful as well.

H.]]'' [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3 that same-sex couples in Canada were entitled to receive many of the financial and legal benefits commonly associated with marriage. However, this decision stopped short of giving them the right to full legal marriage. Most laws which affect couples are within provincial rather than federal jurisdiction. As a result, rights varied somewhat from province to province.\n\nOn January 14, 2001, Reverend [[Brent Hawkes]] forced the issue by performing two same-sex marriages, taking advantage of the fact that Ontario law authorizes him to perform marriages without a previous license, via the issuance of [[banns of marriage]]. The registrar refused to accept the records of marriage, and a lawsuit was commenced over whether the marriages were legally performed. In other provinces, lawsuits were launched seeking permission to marry.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, decisions in the superior trial courts of Ontario and Quebec held that the restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples was discriminatory and contrary to the equality clause of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights of Freedoms'', while the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] ruled oppositely. On May 1, 2003, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] reversed the superior court decision. \n*in Ontario: ''[[Halpern v Canada (AG)|Halpern v. Canada]] (Attorney General)'' 95 C.R.R. (2d) 1 (Ontario Superior Court, July 12, 2002)\n*in Quebec: ''Hendricks v. Quebec'' [2002] R.J.Q. 2506 (Quebec Superior Court, September 6, 2002)\n* in British Columbia: ''Barbeau v. British Columbia'' 2003 BCCA 251 (British Columbia Court of Appeal, May 1, 2003)\n\nThe courts in each case suspended the effect of the declarations of invalidity for two years, to allow the federal government to consider legislative responses to the rulings. However, on June 10, 2003, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] ruled on an appeal in the ''Halpern'' case. The court agreed with the lower court that the traditional definition of marriage was discriminatory and that same-sex marriage was legally permitted. However, unlike the previous three court decisions, the Court of Appeal did not suspend its decision to allow Parliament to consider the issue. Instead, it ruled that the 2001 marriages were legal and same-sex marriage was available throughout Ontario immediately: ''[[Halpern v Canada (AG)]]''.<ref name=\"Halpern_CA\">[https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2003/2003canlii26403/2003canlii26403.html?autocompleteStr=halpern&autocompletePos=1 ''Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)'', 2003 CanLII 26403 (Ont. CA).]</ref>\n\nThe federal government had appealed the trial decisions to the provincial courts of appeal, but following the decision on the Ontario Court of Appeal, Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien announced on June 17, 2003 that the federal government would not seek to appeal the decisions to the Supreme Court. Instead, it would propose a draft ''Civil Marriage Act'' and refer it to the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion.\n\n====Ontario decision====\n{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Ontario}}\n\nIn 2003, the couples in ''Halpern v. Canada'' appealed the decision, requesting that the decision take effect immediately instead of after a delay. On June 10, 2003, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] confirmed that current Canadian law on marriage violated the equality provisions in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in being restricted to heterosexual couples. The court did not allow the province any grace time to bring its laws in line with the ruling, making Ontario the first jurisdiction in [[North America]] to recognize same-sex marriage.<ref name=\"Halpern_CA\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Lee |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2980250.stm |title=Ontario legalises gay marriage |work=BBC News |date=June 11, 2003 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> The city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples.

However, the definition of marriage is a federal law. On June 17, 2003, then Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien announced that the government would not appeal the Ontario ruling, and that his government would introduce legislation to recognize same-sex marriage but protect the rights of churches to decide which marriages they would solemnize.\n\nA draft of the bill was issued on July 17. It read:<blockquote>\n#Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.\n#Nothing in this Act affects the freedom of officials of religious groups to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs.</blockquote>\n\nThe draft bill was subsequently referred to the Supreme Court; see below.\n\nOn September 16, 2003, a motion was brought to Parliament by the [[Canadian Alliance]] (now the Conservative Party) to once again reaffirm the heterosexual definition of marriage. The same language that had been passed in 1999 was brought to a free vote, with members asked to vote for or against the 1999 definition of marriage as \"the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/gay_marriage/unions.html |title=The Battle Over Same-sex Marriage |publisher=PBS |work=The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer |date=June 30, 2005 |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> Motions are not legislatively binding in Canada, and are mostly done for symbolic purposes. The September vote was extremely divisive, however. Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien reversed his previous stance and voted against the motion, as did Paul Martin (who later became prime minister) and many other prominent Liberals. Several Liberals retained their original stance, however, and thus the vote was not defined purely along party lines. Controversially, over 30 members of the House did not attend the vote, the majority of whom were Liberals who had voted against legalizing same-sex marriage in 1999.

The [[reference question|reference]] as originally posed by Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien asked three questions:<blockquote>\n#Is the annexed Proposal for an Act respecting certain aspects of legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada? If not, in what particular or particulars, and to what extent?\n#If the answer to question 1 is yes, is section 1 of the proposal, which extends capacity to marry to persons of the same sex, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? If not, in what particular or particulars, and to what extent?\n#Does the freedom of religion guaranteed by paragraph 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protect religious officials from being compelled to perform a marriage between two persons of the same sex that is contrary to their religious beliefs?</blockquote>\n\nPrime Minister Paul Martin later added a fourth in January 2004:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_marb9.htm |title=Same-sex Marriage (SSM) in Canada - Past Predictions of the Fate of SSM Legislation}}</ref><blockquote>\n{{ordered list|start=4|Is the opposite-sex requirement for marriage for civil purposes, as established by the common law and set out for Quebec in s. 5 of the Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

The court stated that such a ruling is not necessary because the federal government had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6685653 |title=Canada Supreme Court rules for gay marriage |work=NBC News |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Debate prior to C-38's introduction===\nOn December 9, 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin indicated that the federal government would introduce legislation expanding marriage to same-sex couples.

For example, the [[Quran|Qur'an]] (7:80-81, 26:165) and the Bible (Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-27, I Timothy 1:9-10, etc.) are frequently interpreted to explicitly forbid [[homosexuality]]. (See related article, \"[[Homosexuality and religion]]\")\n\nHowever, some major religious groups spoke in favour of legalizing same-sex marriage. The largest [[Protestant]] denomination in the country, the [[United Church of Canada]], offers church weddings to same-sex couples and supports same-sex marriages, testifying to this effect during the cross-country Justice Committee hearings.

But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\"). This is another All-India related festival. The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month of Savan (July/August). This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year. This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91). Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers. In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon. The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system. The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In \n the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.\"<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137>\n{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/BhavishyaPuranaWithHindiTranslationPart3BaburamUpadhyaya20032/Bhavishya%20Purana%20with%20Hindi%20Translation%20Part%203%20-%20Baburam%20Upadhyaya%202003%20%282%29#page/n531|title=Bhavisha Mahapuranam with Hindi translation, Part 3|last = Upadhyay|first = Baburam (translator)|publisher=Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|location=Allahabad|year = 2003|pages=516\u2013518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Relation to territorial exogamy==\nOf special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]]\u2014in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\" /> Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: <blockquote>Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular.

One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families.

Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers.  (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held.  The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\").  This is another All-India related festival.  The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month  of Savan (July/August).  This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year.  This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91).  Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers.  In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon.  The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system.  The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.'

In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular.

M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. <blockquote> The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shaka|Shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\"/></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote> Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" />  In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.
