At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipino]]s and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesian]] puppet government.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996</ref> \n\nTerauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement. When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref>\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army.

The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for [[War crime|war crimes]], such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Hayashi_Cox_1959_Kogun</ref>\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army.

At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipino]]s and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesian]] puppet government.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996</ref> \n\nTerauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement. When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning.

Santayana published two obituaries for Sanborn, the first of which appeared in the ''Harvard Monthly'' Volume eight, Number One, March 1889. \"The rare facility and delicacy of Mr. Sanborn's verses,\" Santayana wrote, \"and his general literary aptitude, marked him out among his class-mates. His witty conversation, and much more the inward seriousness and idealism of his nature endeared him to those that knew him well. He was too sensitive and retiring to like general society, or to speak out his thoughts: he was more at ease with his pen. Mr. Sanborn had not only great felicity of style in his light verses, but he could put into them what is far more rare in the work of very young men,-- a true love of whatever is charming, beautiful and ideal. Yet with this idealism was joined a genuine and pathetic modesty. He was afraid he was wrong, he longed for recognition and external encouragement. This premature death is a calamity not to Mr. Sanborn's family and intimate friends alone. The class of '86 and Harvard College lose a man whose life would have been devoted to letters, and whose genuine and versatile talent would hardly have failed to leave some mark in the world.\"<ref>Santayana, George,''The Harvard Monthly'', Vol. 8, No.1, March 1889.</ref>\n\nIn his 1943 memoirs, Santayana remembered Sanborn as \"a poet of lyric and modest flights...His poems showed genuine feeling, not naturally in harmony with the over-intellectualized [[transcendentalism]] of Concord, Massachusetts, where his father was a conspicuous member of the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]ian circle.\"{{sfn|Clark|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/4422}}\n\nThe protagonist in Santayana's novel ''[[The Last Puritan]]'' is said to be based in part on his college friend, Tom Sanborn.<ref>Santayana, George, ''The Letters of George Santayana, Book Five, 1933-1936, Volume 5'', edited by William G. Holzberger and Herman J. Saatkamp Jr., Oct 10, 2003.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I was born a moral aristocrat, able to obey only the voice of God, which means that of my own heart.... We will lie low, and dip under, until the flood has passed and wasted itself over our heads. We are not wanted. In the world to-day we are a belated phenomenon, like April snow. Perhaps it is time for us to die. If we resist, and try to cling to the fringes, as I have done so far, we are shaken off rudely, or allowed to hang on neglected and disowned. If we attempt to live apart, as my father did, we wither early into amiable ghosts.... We will not accept anything cheaper or cruder than our own conscience. We have dedicated ourselves to the truth, to living in the presence of the noblest things we can conceive. If we can't live so, we won't live at all.<ref>Santayana, George, ''The Last Puritan''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936, pp. 581, 582</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Writings==\nSanborn was an editor and regular contributor to the literary journals ''Harvard Monthly'' and ''Harvard Advocate'' and the humor magazine, the ''Harvard Lampoon''. While on the staff of the ''Springfield Republican'', his poetry and dramatic reviews were included without attribution. He also contributed to the magazines ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.<ref name=\"Thomas Parker Sanborn 1889\">Obituary of Thomas Parker Sanborn, ''The Springfield Republican'', March 5, 1889.</ref> In his biography of Henry Thoreau, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn included a portion of the poem \"Endymion\" by his son Thomas, who was seventeen at the time of its writing. The title of the poem refers to the myth of [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], a mortal who was so beautiful that the goddess of the moon fell in love with him and asked that he be given eternal youth; and so he was made to sleep a deathless sleep forever.  Frank Sanborn placed the poem at the conclusion of the chapter of his book wherein Thoreau dies, suggesting the beautiful Henry Thoreau is immortal.

Santayana published two obituaries for Sanborn, the first of which appeared in the ''Harvard Monthly'' Volume eight, Number One, March 1889. \"The rare facility and delicacy of Mr. Sanborn's verses,\" Santayana wrote, \"and his general literary aptitude, marked him out among his class-mates. His witty conversation, and much more the inward seriousness and idealism of his nature endeared him to those that knew him well. He was too sensitive and retiring to like general society, or to speak out his thoughts: he was more at ease with his pen. Mr. Sanborn had not only great felicity of style in his light verses, but he could put into them what is far more rare in the work of very young men,-- a true love of whatever is charming, beautiful and ideal. Yet with this idealism was joined a genuine and pathetic modesty. He was afraid he was wrong, he longed for recognition and external encouragement. This premature death is a calamity not to Mr. Sanborn's family and intimate friends alone. The class of '86 and Harvard College lose a man whose life would have been devoted to letters, and whose genuine and versatile talent would hardly have failed to leave some mark in the world.\"<ref>Santayana, George,''The Harvard Monthly'', Vol. 8, No.1, March 1889.</ref>\n\nIn his 1943 memoirs, Santayana remembered Sanborn as \"a poet of lyric and modest flights...His poems showed genuine feeling, not naturally in harmony with the over-intellectualized [[transcendentalism]] of Concord, Massachusetts, where his father was a conspicuous member of the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]ian circle.\"{{sfn|Clark|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/4422}}\n\nThe protagonist in Santayana's novel ''[[The Last Puritan]]'' is said to be based in part on his college friend, Tom Sanborn.<ref>Santayana, George, ''The Letters of George Santayana, Book Five, 1933-1936, Volume 5'', edited by William G.

We will lie low, and dip under, until the flood has passed and wasted itself over our heads. We are not wanted. In the world to-day we are a belated phenomenon, like April snow. Perhaps it is time for us to die. If we resist, and try to cling to the fringes, as I have done so far, we are shaken off rudely, or allowed to hang on neglected and disowned. If we attempt to live apart, as my father did, we wither early into amiable ghosts.... We will not accept anything cheaper or cruder than our own conscience. We have dedicated ourselves to the truth, to living in the presence of the noblest things we can conceive. If we can't live so, we won't live at all.<ref>Santayana, George, ''The Last Puritan''.

I remember being at my crib and I was arguing with somebody and pissed off about something. Jeezy just reached out about needing some beats: \"I need them yams.\" I was in the perfect mood. I remember being home alone and it was probably around 3 a.m. and I started making the beat. I turned off all the lights and got the feeling I did when I was a kid walking into the studio for the first time and seeing all the different lights, meters flashing, computer on desktop mode and everything was just a vibe. I rolled up a couple blunts and lit up the first one to get in the zone. The first sounds I played made me feel like I was in The Twilight Zone. When I first made the \"Put On\" beat, I wanted it to feel like a new anthem for the Chicago Bulls when they came out on the floor. I was thinking about the Bulls anthem with Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan in primetime. I made that beat in 30 minutes and put it into Pro Tools and sent it over to Jeezy fresh off the press.\" \n</blockquote>\n\n==Live performancees==\nJeezy and West performed \"Put On\" at both the [[BET Awards 2008|2008 BET Awards]] and [[2008 BET Hip Hop Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BET Awards 2008 - Show |url=https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/rapper-young-jeezy-and-kanye-west-on-stage-during-the-2008-news-photo/81706336 |website=Getty Images |date=24 June 2008}}</ref> The two also performed the song during Jeezy's [[Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101|TM101]]: 10 Year anniversary Concert in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Eric Diep |title=Jeezy Brought Out Everyone (Except Jay Z) for His 'TM: 101' 10th Anniversary Concert |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2015/07/jeezy-tm-101-10th-anniversary-concert-recap |website=Complex |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729222432/https://www.complex.com/music/2015/07/jeezy-tm-101-10th-anniversary-concert-recap |archivedate=29 July 2015 |date=27 July 2015}}</ref> \n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] for \"Put On\", directed by [[Gil Green (director)|Gil Green]] as featuring [[Amber Rose]] in one of her first high-profile appearances, premiered on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s [[106 & Park]] on July 21, 2008.
