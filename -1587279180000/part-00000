He was a former singer for the band [[Kumbia Kings]] and was a lead singer for [[Kumbia All Starz]], both created by [[A.B. Quintanilla]]. In early 2008, he left Kumbia All Starz to become a solo artist. His debut studio album ''[[Yo Soy (Pee Wee album)|Yo Soy]]'' was released on August 11, 2009.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early life and discovery (1989\u20132003)===\nIrvin Salinas, known as Pee Wee, was born on December 8, 1989, in [[Othello, Washington]]. He is the youngest of three siblings (his older sister named Elizabeth Salinas and his older brother Simon Salinas). His father, Horacio Salinas was an alcoholic, and put in rehabilitation while Irvin was thirteen years old. After his parents separated, his mother, Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, changed residence to La Joya, Texas, located in the outskirts of [[McAllen, Texas]]. Irvin began to wash cars, wash dishes  and perform other small jobs in order to provide his family with extra income. He has an uncle in Navasota, Texas after the name of Rafael Salinas. At thirteen, he met A.B. Quintanilla, brother of [[Selena]], in a casting at Pee Wee's middle school. It was then that A.B. Quintanilla expressed interest in Pee Wee, and informed him about a casting for a music video with his band and offered him an audition. Irvin accepted, presenting to him a few days later in the casting. He also went to Memorial Middle School and [[La Joya High School]].\n\n===Kumbia Kings (2003\u201306)===\nHis artistic career began in 2003 when he joined [[A.B. Quintanilla]]'s band [[Kumbia Kings]] after several members like [[Frankie J]] and [[DJ Kane]] left Kumbia Kings. In 2004, he recorded his first song and video with [[Kumbia Kings]], \"[[Sabes a Chocolate]]\" on the album ''[[Los Remixes 2.0]]'', released on April 6, 2004, being a round success and showing a very good response of the public. Due to the success, Quintanilla decided the absolute stay of Irvin, and nicknamed him \"Pee Wee\" for being the minor of all the band members. It was on the album ''[[Fuego (Kumbia Kings album)|Fuego]]'', released on October 5, 2004, that included his second success \"[[Na Na Na (Dulce Ni\u00f1a)]]\", being much accepted also by the public, and his success led to it reaching a big popularity with the public, and especially with the fans, who increased notably thanks to him.\n\nOn April 7, 2005, Pee Wee along with [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and the rest of the [[Kumbia Kings]] participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', the tribute concert for [[Selena]], A.B. Quintanilla's sister, performing \"[[Baila Esta Kumbia]]\". Kumbia Kings later released the album ''[[Duetos (Kumbia Kings album)|Duetos]]'' on March 29, 2005, which included \"Baila Esta Kumbia\".\n\n[[Kumbia Kings]] released their live album ''[[Kumbia Kings Live]]'' on April 4, 2006, which included the single \"[[Pachuco (song)|Pachuco]]\". They won a [[Latin Grammy]] for the album ''Kumbia Kings Live''.\n\nLater, on August 2006, a legal disagreement between [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and [[Cruz Mart\u00ednez]], the co-producer of the band, resulted in A.B. Quintanilla leaving Kumbia Kings. Other members started to leave including Pee Wee who left Kumbia Kings after Cruz Mart\u00ednez replaced him with Jo-Joe because he didn't show up for a concert. Pee Wee continued with A.B. Quintanilla and [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] (brother-in-law of Quintanilla), joining him in his following project that would be the band [[Kumbia All Starz]].\n\n===Kumbia All Starz (2006\u201308)===\nOn August 2006, Pee Wee became the lead singer for [[A.B. Quintanilla]]'s new band [[Kumbia All Starz]]. [[Kumbia All Starz]] launched their single \"[[Chiquilla]]\" on September 19, 2006 which turned out to be a success. The band released their debut album ''[[Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz]]'' on October 3, 2006. They also launched other singles in 2007, \"[[Parece Que Va a Llover]]\", \"[[Speedy Gonzales (song)|Speedy Gonzales]]\", and \"[[Mami Anoche No Dorm\u00ed|Mami/Anoche No Dorm\u00ed]]\". Nevertheless, on February 1, 2008, it was announced that Pee Wee had left the band Kumbia All Starz to begin a career as solo singer a month before the band's second album ''[[Planeta Kumbia]]'' was released. [[A.B. Quintanilla]] declared that he had already signed a contract with a record company of which the name he did not mention.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, Pee Wee presented himself in the program ''[[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]] Presenta'', transmitted by [[Univision]], in which he declared that it was false: \"Everything he said is false, I never signed with any record company but, yes I have received many offers lately and have not accepted any yet\" he declared. Also it gave an exclusive interview the raw declarations about his abandonment of the band and of the ill-treatment that he and his partners of band were receiving on the part of A.B. Quintanilla.\n\nWhen one questioned him if he had decided to leave the band, he declared: \"A.B. gave us a date that he would pay us the money from the recordings that we had done, nevertheless the date had happened and he had not given us any of the money. We had a meeting in which we spoke about several topics, but apparently he said to us that we were replaceable and that we could leave if we wanted, that the door was opened. Me and my partners Memo and Roque could leave that the door was opened and that we were going away\".\n\nHe gave the declarations given by Pee Wee individually without the company of the band or of anybody. He also declared the maltreatment that his mother, Maria Mart\u00ednez had got from Quintanilla, on having sent his representative Luigi Giraldo to call her to say that they had 24 hours to leave the house that Quintanilla had offered to Pee Wee and his mother. Pee Wee said that he is going to keep on singing and not leave his fans.\n\n===Solo, ''Bust a Ritmo'', ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'', ''Camaleones'' and ''Yo Soy'' (2008\u201311)===\nProblems with [[A.B. Quintanilla]] forced him to leave [[Kumbia All Starz]]. After he left the band Kumbia All Starz, [[Cruz Mart\u00ednez]] invited Pee Wee to be a part of his band [[Los Super Reyes]], but Pee Wee declined the invitation to pursue a career as solo artist. He collaborated with [[Erre XI]] on the song \"[[Carita Bonita]]\", released on February 19, 2008.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, he became the host of the series ''Bust a Ritmo'' on [[MTV Tr3s]].\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Pee Wee made his debut as a solo artist in [[2008 Premios Juventud]] performing \"[[Life Is a Dance Floor]]\". In September 2008, Pee Wee was invited by Rub\u00e9n and Santiago Galindo to take part in the reality show ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'', production of [[Televisa]], in the first season of ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os: Sangre de Mi Sangre'' where he competed with artists such as [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Edith M\u00e1rquez]], [[Ernesto D'Alessio]] and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]], along with Susana Fuente and Adriana Fuente, the Fuentes.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, Pee Wee and his team defeated [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]] in the final of ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'' and gaining the right to take part in ''Los Reyes del Show''. In A Telethon in 2008, Pee Wee declared that he was officially a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holamun2.com/news/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day-pee-wee-finally-gets-his-papers |title=Get the latest quote-of-the-day news in the Latino community &#124; mun2 |publisher=Holamun2.com |accessdate=2013-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022005219/http://www.holamun2.com/news/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day-pee-wee-finally-gets-his-papers |archivedate=October 22, 2010 }}</ref>\nHe collaborated with other singers like [[RBD]] members [[Christopher Uckermann]] and [[Dulce Mar\u00eda]]. On ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'' he debuted a new song titled \"[[Qu\u00e9date]]\" with [[Timbiriche|La Nueva Banda Timbiriche]].\n\nIn November 2008, Pee Wee opened the concerts for [[RBD]] during the [[Gira Del Adios World Tour]] in [[Brazil]] except for the two extra shows.\n\nDecember 7, 2008, was the beginning of ''Los Reyes del Show'' where Pee Wee managed to make it to the finale of the program on December 14, 2008, where he again managed to win and defeat Gloria Trevi and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]], gaining $1,000,000.00 USD. The money was distributed in $333,333.00 USD between the 3 members of the team.\n\nOn March 26, 2009, [[Flex (singer)|Flex]] and Pee Wee sang together in [[Premios Lo Nuestro 2009]] singing \"[[Dime Si Te Vas Con \u00c9l]]\". On May 29, 2009, he released his new single \"[[Cumbay\u00e1 (Pee Wee song)|Cumbay\u00e1]]\". \"Cumbay\u00e1\" was released worldwide on June 1, 2009. \"Cumbay\u00e1\" was released on June 30, 2009, on iTunes. On July 5, performed the hit single \"[[Carita Bonita]]\" and a new single called \"[[Tan Feliz]]\" featuring two new Puerto Rican reggaeton singers Dyland & Lenny in Premios Tecate Deportes 2009. On July 16, 2009, Pee Wee performed for the first time, his new single \"Cumbay\u00e1\" in [[2009 Premios Juventud]]. On July 27, 2009, the [[telenovela]] ''[[Camaleones]]'' premiered in [[Mexico]] in which Pee Wee stars as Ulises Mor\u00e1n.\n\nOn August 11, 2009, his debut studio album ''[[Yo Soy (Pee Wee album)|Yo Soy]]'' was released.<ref name=\":0\" /> On August 12, was scheduled to perform on [[Premios Texas]] 2010 from Austin, Texas. He was nominated for Best Male Artist.\n\n===Name change and second studio album (2011\u2013present)===\nIn 2011, Pee Wee returned to the scene once again and changed his name to PW. He says \"PW is the evolution of Pee Wee, as it shows his growth from when he debuted to what he is now.\" He signed with [[Top Stop Music]], a record label that features artists such as [[Prince Royce]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. His debut single as \"PW\", \"[[Wanna Be Yours]]\", was released on September 27, 2011. The refreshing, ultra-modern [[dance music|dance]] track was produced by [[Sergio George]] and French producers [[So Fly]] and [[Nius]]. The video was shot at [[Universal Studios]] and showed a whole new side of PW that his audience has never seen before. There is a lot of dancing and clearly shows his evolution as an entertainer. His new album should be released by February 2012.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n!

He was a former singer for the band [[Kumbia Kings]] and was a lead singer for [[Kumbia All Starz]], both created by [[A.B. Quintanilla]]. In early 2008, he left Kumbia All Starz to become a solo artist. His debut studio album ''[[Yo Soy (Pee Wee album)|Yo Soy]]'' was released on August 11, 2009.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early life and discovery (1988\u20132003)===\nIrvin Salinas, known as Pee Wee, was born on December 8, 1988, in [[Othello, Washington]]. He is the youngest of three siblings (his older sister named Elizabeth Salinas and his older brother Simon Salinas). His father, Horacio Salinas was an alcoholic, and put in rehabilitation while Irvin was thirteen years old. After his parents separated, his mother, Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, changed residence to La Joya, Texas, located in the outskirts of [[McAllen, Texas]]. Irvin began to wash cars, wash dishes  and perform other small jobs in order to provide his family with extra income. He has an uncle in Navasota, Texas after the name of Rafael Salinas. At thirteen, he met A.B. Quintanilla, brother of [[Selena]], in a casting at Pee Wee's middle school. It was then that A.B. Quintanilla expressed interest in Pee Wee, and informed him about a casting for a music video with his band and offered him an audition. Irvin accepted, presenting to him a few days later in the casting. He also went to Memorial Middle School and [[La Joya High School]].\n\n===Kumbia Kings (2003\u201306)===\nHis artistic career began in 2003 when he joined [[A.B. Quintanilla]]'s band [[Kumbia Kings]] after several members like [[Frankie J]] and [[DJ Kane]] left Kumbia Kings. In 2004, he recorded his first song and video with [[Kumbia Kings]], \"[[Sabes a Chocolate]]\" on the album ''[[Los Remixes 2.0]]'', released on April 6, 2004, being a round success and showing a very good response of the public. Due to the success, Quintanilla decided the absolute stay of Irvin, and nicknamed him \"Pee Wee\" for being the minor of all the band members. It was on the album ''[[Fuego (Kumbia Kings album)|Fuego]]'', released on October 5, 2004, that included his second success \"[[Na Na Na (Dulce Ni\u00f1a)]]\", being much accepted also by the public, and his success led to it reaching a big popularity with the public, and especially with the fans, who increased notably thanks to him.\n\nOn April 7, 2005, Pee Wee along with [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and the rest of the [[Kumbia Kings]] participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', the tribute concert for [[Selena]], A.B. Quintanilla's sister, performing \"[[Baila Esta Kumbia]]\". Kumbia Kings later released the album ''[[Duetos (Kumbia Kings album)|Duetos]]'' on March 29, 2005, which included \"Baila Esta Kumbia\".\n\n[[Kumbia Kings]] released their live album ''[[Kumbia Kings Live]]'' on April 4, 2006, which included the single \"[[Pachuco (song)|Pachuco]]\". They won a [[Latin Grammy]] for the album ''Kumbia Kings Live''.\n\nLater, on August 2006, a legal disagreement between [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and [[Cruz Mart\u00ednez]], the co-producer of the band, resulted in A.B. Quintanilla leaving Kumbia Kings. Other members started to leave including Pee Wee who left Kumbia Kings after Cruz Mart\u00ednez replaced him with Jo-Joe because he didn't show up for a concert. Pee Wee continued with A.B. Quintanilla and [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] (brother-in-law of Quintanilla), joining him in his following project that would be the band [[Kumbia All Starz]].\n\n===Kumbia All Starz (2006\u201308)===\nOn August 2006, Pee Wee became the lead singer for [[A.B. Quintanilla]]'s new band [[Kumbia All Starz]]. [[Kumbia All Starz]] launched their single \"[[Chiquilla]]\" on September 19, 2006 which turned out to be a success. The band released their debut album ''[[Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz]]'' on October 3, 2006. They also launched other singles in 2007, \"[[Parece Que Va a Llover]]\", \"[[Speedy Gonzales (song)|Speedy Gonzales]]\", and \"[[Mami Anoche No Dorm\u00ed|Mami/Anoche No Dorm\u00ed]]\". Nevertheless, on February 1, 2008, it was announced that Pee Wee had left the band Kumbia All Starz to begin a career as solo singer a month before the band's second album ''[[Planeta Kumbia]]'' was released. [[A.B. Quintanilla]] declared that he had already signed a contract with a record company of which the name he did not mention.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, Pee Wee presented himself in the program ''[[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]] Presenta'', transmitted by [[Univision]], in which he declared that it was false: \"Everything he said is false, I never signed with any record company but, yes I have received many offers lately and have not accepted any yet\" he declared. Also it gave an exclusive interview the raw declarations about his abandonment of the band and of the ill-treatment that he and his partners of band were receiving on the part of A.B. Quintanilla.\n\nWhen one questioned him if he had decided to leave the band, he declared: \"A.B. gave us a date that he would pay us the money from the recordings that we had done, nevertheless the date had happened and he had not given us any of the money. We had a meeting in which we spoke about several topics, but apparently he said to us that we were replaceable and that we could leave if we wanted, that the door was opened. Me and my partners Memo and Roque could leave that the door was opened and that we were going away\".\n\nHe gave the declarations given by Pee Wee individually without the company of the band or of anybody. He also declared the maltreatment that his mother, Maria Mart\u00ednez had got from Quintanilla, on having sent his representative Luigi Giraldo to call her to say that they had 24 hours to leave the house that Quintanilla had offered to Pee Wee and his mother. Pee Wee said that he is going to keep on singing and not leave his fans.\n\n===Solo, ''Bust a Ritmo'', ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'', ''Camaleones'' and ''Yo Soy'' (2008\u201311)===\nProblems with [[A.B. Quintanilla]] forced him to leave [[Kumbia All Starz]]. After he left the band Kumbia All Starz, [[Cruz Mart\u00ednez]] invited Pee Wee to be a part of his band [[Los Super Reyes]], but Pee Wee declined the invitation to pursue a career as solo artist. He collaborated with [[Erre XI]] on the song \"[[Carita Bonita]]\", released on February 19, 2008.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, he became the host of the series ''Bust a Ritmo'' on [[MTV Tr3s]].\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Pee Wee made his debut as a solo artist in [[2008 Premios Juventud]] performing \"[[Life Is a Dance Floor]]\". In September 2008, Pee Wee was invited by Rub\u00e9n and Santiago Galindo to take part in the reality show ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'', production of [[Televisa]], in the first season of ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os: Sangre de Mi Sangre'' where he competed with artists such as [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Edith M\u00e1rquez]], [[Ernesto D'Alessio]] and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]], along with Susana Fuente and Adriana Fuente, the Fuentes.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, Pee Wee and his team defeated [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]] in the final of ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'' and gaining the right to take part in ''Los Reyes del Show''. In A Telethon in 2008, Pee Wee declared that he was officially a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holamun2.com/news/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day-pee-wee-finally-gets-his-papers |title=Get the latest quote-of-the-day news in the Latino community &#124; mun2 |publisher=Holamun2.com |accessdate=2013-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022005219/http://www.holamun2.com/news/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day-pee-wee-finally-gets-his-papers |archivedate=October 22, 2010 }}</ref>\nHe collaborated with other singers like [[RBD]] members [[Christopher Uckermann]] and [[Dulce Mar\u00eda]]. On ''El Show de los Sue\u00f1os'' he debuted a new song titled \"[[Qu\u00e9date]]\" with [[Timbiriche|La Nueva Banda Timbiriche]].\n\nIn November 2008, Pee Wee opened the concerts for [[RBD]] during the [[Gira Del Adios World Tour]] in [[Brazil]] except for the two extra shows.\n\nDecember 7, 2008, was the beginning of ''Los Reyes del Show'' where Pee Wee managed to make it to the finale of the program on December 14, 2008, where he again managed to win and defeat Gloria Trevi and [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]], gaining $1,000,000.00 USD. The money was distributed in $333,333.00 USD between the 3 members of the team.\n\nOn March 26, 2009, [[Flex (singer)|Flex]] and Pee Wee sang together in [[Premios Lo Nuestro 2009]] singing \"[[Dime Si Te Vas Con \u00c9l]]\". On May 29, 2009, he released his new single \"[[Cumbay\u00e1 (Pee Wee song)|Cumbay\u00e1]]\". \"Cumbay\u00e1\" was released worldwide on June 1, 2009. \"Cumbay\u00e1\" was released on June 30, 2009, on iTunes. On July 5, performed the hit single \"[[Carita Bonita]]\" and a new single called \"[[Tan Feliz]]\" featuring two new Puerto Rican reggaeton singers Dyland & Lenny in Premios Tecate Deportes 2009. On July 16, 2009, Pee Wee performed for the first time, his new single \"Cumbay\u00e1\" in [[2009 Premios Juventud]]. On July 27, 2009, the [[telenovela]] ''[[Camaleones]]'' premiered in [[Mexico]] in which Pee Wee stars as Ulises Mor\u00e1n.\n\nOn August 11, 2009, his debut studio album ''[[Yo Soy (Pee Wee album)|Yo Soy]]'' was released.<ref name=\":0\" /> On August 12, was scheduled to perform on [[Premios Texas]] 2010 from Austin, Texas. He was nominated for Best Male Artist.\n\n===Name change and second studio album (2011\u2013present)===\nIn 2011, Pee Wee returned to the scene once again and changed his name to PW. He says \"PW is the evolution of Pee Wee, as it shows his growth from when he debuted to what he is now.\" He signed with [[Top Stop Music]], a record label that features artists such as [[Prince Royce]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. His debut single as \"PW\", \"[[Wanna Be Yours]]\", was released on September 27, 2011. The refreshing, ultra-modern [[dance music|dance]] track was produced by [[Sergio George]] and French producers [[So Fly]] and [[Nius]]. The video was shot at [[Universal Studios]] and showed a whole new side of PW that his audience has never seen before. There is a lot of dancing and clearly shows his evolution as an entertainer. His new album should be released by February 2012.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n!

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006.</ref><ref>Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328.</ref> Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.<ref>Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W.

Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W. Burke-Gaffney.</ref> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] noted that Christ was born during the reign of King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]\u2013[[Matthew 2:18|18]]), whose death he placed in 4&nbsp;BC. Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.
