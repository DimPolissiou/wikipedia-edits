If the Prime Minister or a senior party leader of India was killed in the attack, India would have been forced to retaliate militarily.{{sfnp|Riedel, Deadly Embrace|2012|p=69}} In the event, India called the terror attack an \"attack on democracy\" and began [[2001 India Pakistan standoff|large-scale troop mobilisation]] at the India-Pakistan border, launching the largest war games in fifteen years. Pakistan retaliated by launching its own war games, moving troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. The United States, annoyed with the dilution of the War on Terror as well as the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war, delivered an ultimatum to Musharraf, asking him to make \"a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror\". Pushed to a corner, Musharraf announced on 12 January 2002 that no organisation would be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir. He declared a ban on five extremist groups including the JeM. Hundreds of militants were rounded up, states Ahmed Rashid, giving rise to severe hostility and derision from them. However, by March 2002, all the arrested militants were freed and curbs on them were quietly lifted.{{sfnp|Rashid, Descent into Chaos|2012|loc=Chapter 6}} Financial and intelligence inputs to JeM were resumed. Masood Azhar was released under a court order.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\n===Bans, revolts and split=== \nEarlier in 2001, when the group anticipated that the US State Department would declare it a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation, it renamed itself ''Tehrik-ul-Furqan'' and transferred its assets to low-profile supporters. JeM was declared a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation by the United Nations in October 2001 and by the US in December 2001.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nIn response to the January 2002 ban by Pakistan, JeM changed its name to '''Khuddam ul-Islam'''. Khuddam was also banned in 2003, after which it re-branded itself as a charity called ''Al-Rehmat Trust''.<ref name=\"congressional\"/><ref name=rebirth/>\n\nBy this time, the JeM had split into two groups, due to conflicts among the members. Three JeM commanders, Abdul Jabbar, Maulana Umar Farooq and Abdullah Shah Mazhar, left the group and formed ''Jamaat ul-Furqan''. The remaining group that stayed with Masood Azhar used the name ''Khuddam ul-Islam''.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nThe rank and file of the JeM were angered by Musharraf's U-turn in joining the War on Terror. By staying loyal to the Pakistani state, Masood Azhar lost majority support in the JeM Supreme Council, who demanded his resignation. Particularly influential among the rebels was Maulana Abdul Jabbar, whose faction led a ''jihad'' against what they called the \"slave\" government of Pakistan and the US influence upon it. They were supported by Al Qaeda, and joined by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and Harkatul Mujahideen.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\nFrom March to September 2002, the rebels carried out suicide missions on Pakistani officials in cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Murree, Taxila and Bahawalpur. After the fall of the Taliban government, the JeM activists returning from Afghanistan attacked Christian temples, Shia mosques and diplomatic missions inside Pakistan. The ISI demanded Masood Azhar to rein in the rank-and-file. However he had lost control over them. He maintained that they were already expelled from the organisation and the state should arrest them. In fact, most of the factions remained within the JeM and competed with the parent organisation for authority and resources. Some rebellious factions gathered around Abdul Jabbar who launched ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan'' in late 2002. The rebel factions were supported by \"rogue\" members of the ISI.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|pp=927-928}}\n\nIn November 2003, the Musharraf government banned the renamed ''Khuddam ul-Islam'' as well as ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan''. Then the rebels carried out two assassination attempts on President Musharraf himself, on 14 December and 25 December 2003. There was evidence of Pakistan military members providing logistical support for the attempts. The explosives used in the bombings were traced to an Al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan. Masood Azhar too had publicly called for the assassination of Musharraf.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|pp=928}}\n\nEventually, the government cracked down on the rogue elements in the military and intelligence establishments. More than a hundred members were apprehended and dismissed, with some members being sentenced to death. However, the majority of the militant infrastructure was left intact. Azhar's group, which had fallen into relative obscurity by 2004, was allowed to rebuild itself after the problematic portions of the leadership were purged.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=929}} The rebellious factions eventually realigned themselves with [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]] (Pakistani Taliban) in 2007.<ref name=thedead/>\n\n===Revival===\nMasood Azhar stayed loyal to the Pakistani state after 2004.

If the Prime Minister or a senior party leader of India was killed in the attack, India would have been forced to retaliate militarily.{{sfnp|Riedel, Deadly Embrace|2012|p=69}} In the event, India called the terror attack an \"attack on democracy\" and began [[2001 India Pakistan standoff|large-scale troop mobilisation]] at the India-Pakistan border, launching the largest war games in fifteen years. Pakistan retaliated by launching its own war games, moving troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. The United States, annoyed with the dilution of the War on Terror as well as the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war, delivered an ultimatum to Musharraf, asking him to make \"a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror\". Pushed to a corner, Musharraf announced on 12 January 2002 that no organisation would be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir. He declared a ban on five extremist groups including the JeM. Hundreds of militants were rounded up, states Ahmed Rashid, giving rise to severe hostility and derision from them. However, by March 2002, all the arrested militants were freed and curbs on them were quietly lifted.{{sfnp|Rashid, Descent into Chaos|2012|loc=Chapter 6}} Financial and intelligence inputs to JeM were resumed. Masood Azhar was released under a court order.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\n===Bans, revolts and split=== \nEarlier in 2001, when the group anticipated that the US State Department would declare it a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation, it renamed itself ''Tehrik-ul-Furqan'' and transferred its assets to low-profile supporters. JeM was declared a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation by the United Nations in October 2001 and by the US in December 2001.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nIn response to the January 2002 ban by Pakistan, JeM changed its name to '''Khuddam ul-Islam'''. Khuddam was also banned in 2003, after which it re-branded itself as a charity called ''Al-Rehmat Trust''.<ref name=\"congressional\"/><ref name=rebirth/>\n\nBy this time, the JeM had split into two groups, due to conflicts among the members. Three JeM commanders, Abdul Jabbar, Maulana Umar Farooq and Abdullah Shah Mazhar, left the group and formed ''Jamaat ul-Furqan''. The remaining group that stayed with Masood Azhar used the name ''Khuddam ul-Islam''.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nThe rank and file of the JeM were angered by Musharraf's U-turn in joining the War on Terror. By staying loyal to the Pakistani state, Masood Azhar lost majority support in the JeM Supreme Council, who demanded his resignation. Particularly influential among the rebels was Maulana Abdul Jabbar, whose faction led a ''jihad'' against what they called the \"slave\" government of Pakistan and the US influence upon it. They were supported by Al Qaeda, and joined by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and Harkatul Mujahideen.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\nFrom March to September 2002, the rebels carried out suicide missions on Pakistani officials in cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Murree, Taxila and Bahawalpur. After the fall of the Taliban government, the JeM activists returning from Afghanistan attacked Christian temples, Shia mosques and diplomatic missions inside Pakistan. The ISI demanded Masood Azhar to rein in the rank-and-file. However he had lost control over them. He maintained that they were already expelled from the organisation and the state should arrest them. In fact, most of the factions remained within the JeM and competed with the parent organisation for authority and resources. Some rebellious factions gathered around Abdul Jabbar who launched ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan'' in late 2002.

Then the rebels carried out two assassination attempts on President Musharraf himself, on 14 December and 25 December 2003. There was evidence of Pakistan military members providing logistical support for the attempts. The explosives used in the bombings were traced to an Al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan.
