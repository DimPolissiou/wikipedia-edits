The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy.

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n=== Preparation ===\nThe Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8>Larzelere (2003), p. 8</ref> In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)xvi>Larzelere (2003), p. xvi</ref>  Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant [[Elmer Stone]] to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)138>Larzelere (2003), p. 138</ref> On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve-page manual titled ''Confidential Order No. 2, [[Coast Guard Mobilization Plan 1|Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy]]''.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8 /> Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 30 January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3>Larzelere (2003), p. 3</ref>  U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the [[SS Healdton|SS ''Healdton]] and the [[SS Housatonic|SS ''Housatonic'']] and five others with the loss of 36 American lives.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3-6>Larzelere (2003), pp. 3\u20146</ref>\n\n=== Declaration of war ===\n[[File:USCGC Tampa in port c1918.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USCGC ''Tampa'']] in port]]\nOn 6 April 1917, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy.

[[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. During the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=Tilley>Tilley, A History of Women in the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office</ref><ref name=\"womensmemorial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |title=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |publisher=Womensmemorial.org |date=1950-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, {{USCGC|Tampa|1912|6}} parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".

In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.

On 9 August 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 679, known as the [[Magnuson Act]].  This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.  In addition, the Coast Guard established a series of weather ships in the north Pacific Ocean and assisted civilian and military aircraft and ships in distress, and established a string of [[LORAN]] stations in Japan and Korea that assisted the United Nations forces.\n\n===''Pendleton'' rescue===\n{{main|SS Pendleton}}\n[[File:Pendleton Sinking Ship.jpg|thumb|Bow section of the ''Pendleton'', 19 February 1952]]\nOn 18 February 1952, during a severe \"[[nor'easter]]\" off the New England coast, the [[T2 tanker]]s [[SS Fort Mercer|SS ''Fort Mercer'']] and [[SS Pendleton|SS ''Pendleton'']] broke in half.

The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range.

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy.

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n=== Preparation ===\nThe Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8>Larzelere (2003), p. 8</ref> In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)xvi>Larzelere (2003), p. xvi</ref>  Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant [[Elmer Stone]] to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)138>Larzelere (2003), p. 138</ref> On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve-page manual titled ''Confidential Order No. 2, [[Coast Guard Mobilization Plan 1|Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy]]''.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8 /> Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 30 January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3>Larzelere (2003), p. 3</ref>  U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the [[SS Healdton|SS ''Healdton]] and the [[SS Housatonic|SS ''Housatonic'']] and five others with the loss of 36 American lives.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3-6>Larzelere (2003), pp. 3\u20146</ref>\n\n=== Declaration of war ===\n[[File:USCGC Tampa in port c1918.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USCGC ''Tampa'']] in port]]\nOn 6 April 1917, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy. All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. During the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]].

In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

Specifically, actors [[Gig Young]], [[Cesar Romero]], and [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] all served admirably in various capacities in the USCG in the Pacific for several years. The [[A&P]] heir [[Huntington Hartford]] also served in the Pacific as a commander.<ref>Suzanna Andrews, [http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/12/hartford200412 \"Hostage to Fortune\"], ''Vanity Fair'' magazine, December 2004</ref>\n\n===Douglas Munro===\n[[File:2ndMatanikauEvac.jpg|thumb|U.S. Coast Guard personnel evacuating U.S. Marines from near Point Cruz on Guadalcanal under fire during [[Actions along the Matanikau|Second Battle of the Matanikau River]]]].\nSignalman 1st Class [[Douglas Albert Munro|Douglas Munro]] (1919\u20131942), the only Coast Guardsman to receive the [[Medal of Honor]], earned the decoration postumously during [[World War II]] as a small boat coxswain during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in 1942. A Navy [[destroyer escort]], {{USS|Douglas A. Munro|DE-422|}}, was named in his honor in 1944. The cutter {{USCGC|Douglas Munro|WHEC-724|}} was commissioned in 1971, and is still on active service.

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

On 9 August 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 679, known as the [[Magnuson Act]].  This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.  In addition, the Coast Guard established a series of weather ships in the north Pacific Ocean and assisted civilian and military aircraft and ships in distress, and established a string of [[LORAN]] stations in Japan and Korea that assisted the United Nations forces.\n\n===''Pendleton'' rescue===\n{{main|SS Pendleton}}\n[[File:Pendleton Sinking Ship.jpg|thumb|Bow section of the ''Pendleton'', 19 February 1952]]\nOn 18 February 1952, during a severe \"[[nor'easter]]\" off the New England coast, the [[T2 tanker]]s [[SS Fort Mercer|SS ''Fort Mercer'']] and [[SS Pendleton|SS ''Pendleton'']] broke in half.

The first five cutters arrived on 4 May<ref name=Larzelerexxi>Larzelere, p xxi</ref> \n\nSeveral Coast Guard aviators served with the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] and [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] in Southeast Asia from 1968 to 1972. They were involved in combat search and rescue operations in both Vietnam and Laos.<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/KaliszThomasCGAviationVTN.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard provided Explosive Loading Detachments (ELD) to the [[U.S. Army]] [[1st Logistics Command]] in several locations in Vietnam.  The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]]. [[Port Security Unit]]s and [[Naval Coastal Warfare]] units also accompanied the U.S. military buildup.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:US Coast Guard Transportable Port Security Unit.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Port Security Unit patrols Umm Qasr]]\nDuring [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the Coast Guard had deployed its largest contingent of Coast Guardsmen and assets overseas since the Vietnam War.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] antiaircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest.

Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning antiaircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} On 5&nbsp;March, [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near [[Jan Mayen Island]]; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}} or the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, both of which were escorting the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port.

Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. ''Tirpitz'' returned to [[Altafjord]] via the [[Lofoten Islands]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'', escorted by several destroyers, steaming in the [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] in October 1942]]\nFollowing ''R\u00f6sselsprung'', the Germans moved ''Tirpitz'' to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4&nbsp;January 1943 in [[Trondheim Fjord]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 21 February, Topp was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]] and was replaced by Captain [[Hans Karl Meyer|Hans Meyer]]; five days later the battleship ''Scharnhorst'' was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBy the time ''Scharnhorst'' arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded but caused only superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] were shot down by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] antiaircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest. The ship's crew cut down trees and placed them aboard ''Tirpitz'' to camouflage her.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The crew also frequently hid the entire ship from [[aerial reconnaissance]] and attacks inside a cloud of artificial fog, created using water and [[chlorosulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Hartl et. al.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi legacy found in Norwegian trees|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43727547|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=11 April 2018|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> Additional antiaircraft batteries were installed around the fjord, as were anti-torpedo nets and heavy booms in the entrance to the anchorage.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=19}} ''Tirpitz'' was known as the \"Lonely Queen of the North\" because she was so rarely deployed,<ref>Winston, George, (1 May 2018) \"[https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/the-effects-of-the-lonely-queen.html The Effects of the Lonely Queen Still Seen Among the Trees of Norway]\", War History Online; accessed 2020.04.01.</ref> and life for her crew was very monotonous. Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning antiaircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''.

Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after ''Tirpitz'' left Norway, the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine K-21|''K-21'']] fired two or four torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}{{sfn|Polmar & Noot|pp=115\u2013116}} The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship.{{sfn|Blair|p=644}} Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British [[Admiralty]], which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. ''Tirpitz'' returned to [[Altafjord]] via the [[Lofoten Islands]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'', escorted by several destroyers, steaming in the [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] in October 1942]]\nFollowing ''R\u00f6sselsprung'', the Germans moved ''Tirpitz'' to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4&nbsp;January 1943 in [[Trondheim Fjord]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 21 February, Topp was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]] and was replaced by Captain [[Hans Karl Meyer|Hans Meyer]]; five days later the battleship ''Scharnhorst'' was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBy the time ''Scharnhorst'' arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded but caused only superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] were shot down by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested.

{"title_page": "Regeneration (Doctor Who)", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=May 2011}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Regeneration (''Doctor Who'')}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn the long-running [[British television science fiction|British science fiction television series]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'', '''regeneration''' is a biological ability exhibited by the [[Time Lord]]s, a race of fictional [[humanoid]]s originating on the planet [[Gallifrey]]. This process allows a Time Lord  to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the show as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting reasons.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor|current incarnation]] of the Doctor is played by [[Jodie Whittaker]], following the regeneration of the [[Twelfth Doctor]] (portrayed by [[Peter Capaldi]]) during the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n==Conceptual history==\n\n===Inspiration===\n\nThe concept of regeneration was created in 1966 by the writers of ''Doctor Who'' as a method of replacing the leading actor. The role of the Doctor had been played by [[William Hartnell]] since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that Hartnell's health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with. Producer [[John Wiles]] had, following several clashes with Hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in ''[[The Celestial Toymaker]]''; during two episodes of that serial, the Doctor is invisible (owing to Hartnell being on holiday during the recording). Wiles' plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor. This proposal was vetoed by [[Gerald Savory]], the BBC's Head of Serials (and Wiles' superior), which led to Wiles leaving before ''The Celestial Toymaker'' was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/season3.shtml |title=Classic Episodes: Season 3|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |website=BBC Doctor Who |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> However, it was apparent that it would not be possible for Hartnell to continue for much longer.\n\nOn 29 July 1966, production concluded on the final episode of ''[[The Smugglers]]'', the last serial recorded in the [[Doctor Who (season 3)|third production block]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} During production, Hartnell and producer [[Innes Lloyd]] had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would be the first one produced as part of [[Doctor Who (season 4)|Season 4]]. Script editor [[Gerry Davis (screenwriter)|Gerry Davis]] proposed that, since the Doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body. Lloyd took this further by suggesting that the Doctor could do this \"renewal\" regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The process itself was modelled on [[LSD]] trips, with the experience being like the \"hell and dank horror\" of taking the drug.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/8616413.stm |work=BBC News | title=LSD inspired Doctor regeneration | date=12 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', the [[First Doctor]] collapses from apparent old age and exhaustion, having commented earlier that his body was \"wearing a bit thin\". Then, before the eyes of his companions [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]] and [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]], and of the viewing audience, his features shift into that of the [[Second Doctor]], played by [[Patrick Troughton]]. In ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'', the Second Doctor's first story, the Doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.<ref name=\"power\">{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/powerdaleks/detail.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The Power of the Daleks \u2013 Details| accessdate=1 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Developing the concept===\nIt was not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the Doctor's as opposed to a process initiated by technology. In ''Power of the Daleks'', the Second Doctor describes his renewal as a function of his [[TARDIS]] [[Time travel|time machine]], stating that \"without it, [he] couldn't survive.\"<ref name=\"power\" />\n\nWhen Troughton left the series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, but this time the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the conclusion of ''[[The War Games]]'', where it is referred to as a \"change of appearance\". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although [[Jon Pertwee]]'s portrayal of the [[Third Doctor]] also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in ''The War Games'' the Doctor protests, \"You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!\"\n\nAs the series continued, more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced, but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of ''[[Planet of the Spiders]] ''(1974)'', ''when Pertwee's Third Doctor turns into [[Tom Baker]]'s [[Fourth Doctor]]. In this scene, the change is called \"regeneration\" for the first time, and is explained as a biological process that occurs when a Time Lord's body is dying. It is also stated that following the regeneration the Doctor's brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be \"erratic\" for a time, something that would be evident for most subsequent regenerations.\n\nIn the ''About Time'' reference series [[Lawrence Miles]] and [[Tat Wood]] note that the officially licensed magazine, ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Monthly]]'', stated in a \"Matrix Data-Bank\" column in 1982 that its readers should not confuse the \"regenerations\" of later incarnations with the \"rejuvenation\" of Hartnell into Troughton.<ref name=\"about time 3\">{{cite book\n | author=Lawrence Miles\n |author2=Tat Wood \n |date=October 2004\n | title = About Time 3: The Unauthorized Guide to Doctor Who (Seasons 7 to 11)\n | location = New Orleans\n | publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]]\n | isbn = 0-9725959-2-9\n | page = 173\n |author2-link=Tat Wood \n |author-link=Lawrence Miles \n }}</ref> However, dialogue within the series itself explicitly includes the First-to-Second \"rejuvenation\" when enumerating the Doctor's regenerations (for example in ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983)).\n\nIn ''[[The Timeless Children]]'', it is explained that the Time Lords got their regeneration ability from an unknown person called The Timeless Child, a child found by an explorer called Tecteun. The child has seemingly infinite regenerations. Tecteun splices the regeneration ability from The Timeless Child across all Time Lords. It is revealed The Timeless Child is The Doctor, and that her thirteen lives (by the point of this episode) are not her only ones and she has lived an unknown number of previous lives.\n\n===Transitions===\n[[File:Regeneration 4-5.gif|thumb|The Fourth Doctor regenerates into the Fifth Doctor (from ''[[Logopolis]]'', 1981, and ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', 1982)]]\nThe regeneration \"effect\" was accomplished during the series' original run from 1963\u20131989 primarily through the use of [[Superimposing|video mixing]]. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of ''The Tenth Planet'' with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be [[Clipping (photography)|overexposed]] to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of ''The Tenth Planet'', and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSubsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects. The transition from the Fourth to the [[Fifth Doctor]] used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the Watcher, but aside from this, other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the incoming actor on top of the outgoing one. The transition from the [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] to the [[Eighth Doctor]] in the [[Doctor Who (1996)|1996 television movie]] took advantage of the higher budget and modern [[computer generated imagery|computer animation]] technology to [[morphing|\"morph\"]] the features of [[Sylvester McCoy]] into those of [[Paul McGann]].\n\nWith the exception of the transitions from the Second to Third, each regeneration was shown on-screen, with the previous incumbent in the role symbolically \"handing off\" the character to the next. The Second Doctor was never seen to actually change into the Third, simply fading off into darkness at the end of ''The War Games'' and then stumbling out of the TARDIS, already regenerated, at the start of ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970).\n\nThe regeneration of the [[Sixth Doctor]] into the Seventh is the only time that a single actor took on the roles of two incarnations of the Doctor. [[Colin Baker]] declined the invitation to film the regeneration sequence at the start of ''[[Time and the Rani]]'' (1987) due to the circumstances in which the BBC dismissed him from the role.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} As a result, Sylvester McCoy had to don his predecessor's costume and a blond curly wig, lying face down, with the mixing effect to the Doctor's \"new\" features occurring as he was turned over.\n\nThe 2005 series, which revived the programme after its cancellation 16 years earlier, began with the Ninth Doctor already regenerated and no explanation given as to the circumstances behind the change (although a scene in the debut episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" when the Doctor commented on his appearance in a mirror indicated that the change had recently occurred). In the documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', producer [[Russell T Davies]] explained his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would be not only confusing for new viewers but also lacking in dramatic impact, as there would have been no emotional investment in the character being replaced.<ref name=\"confidential\">{{cite episode\n | title = Bringing Back the Doctor\n | episodelink = Doctor Who Confidential#Series 1 (2005)\n | series = Doctor Who Confidential\n | serieslink = Doctor Who Confidential\n | credits = Gillane Seaborne\n | network = BBC\n | airdate = 2005-03-26\n}}</ref> The regeneration into the Ninth Doctor was later seen and explained in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" (2013). In this episode, the [[War Doctor]] automatically begins a regeneration due to old age at the end of the Last Great Time War. However, the full transition is not seen with only the start of the regeneration being shown.\n\nThe regeneration of the [[Ninth Doctor]] into the [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] at the end of \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) used computer effects to morph [[Christopher Eccleston]] into [[David Tennant]]. In the episode of ''Doctor Who Confidential'' accompanying the episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), where the same effect is used for [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2010) during which [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] took over the role as the [[Eleventh Doctor]]; in \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"[[Day of the Moon]]\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\" when Mels ([[Nina Toussaint-White]]) is shot and regenerates into [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]). \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]] episode \"[[The Lie of the Land (Doctor Who)|The Lie of the Land]]\", the [[Twelfth Doctor]] fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill]] still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.\n\nThe regeneration from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Doctor slightly differs from other regenerations from the revived series. During \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Eleventh Doctor reveals that he has used all his regenerations and is in fact in his thirteen and final body, leading to his aged appearance during the events of the episode. At the conclusion, the Time Lords grant him a new regeneration cycle, and he begins his thirteenth regeneration in the explosive manner that has become tradition (so explosive that it destroys invading Dalek forces including a ship and the village of Christmas in the process). However, as this regeneration is the first in a new cycle, it initially only \"resets\" his current body back to its youthful appearance (the Doctor referring to this as the cycle \"breaking in\"), and the eventual transition to the [[Twelfth Doctor]] happens with a flash and the actor suddenly lurching back, standing back up to reveal the new Doctor.\n\nIn the 2017 Christmas special [[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]], the Twelfth Doctor completes his regeneration into the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] (played by incumbent actress [[Jodie Whittaker]]). The effect used was more akin to the Tenth Doctor's regeneration to the Eleventh, with an explosive energy discharge being released from the Doctor, and steady streams of regeneration energy being emitted from his hands and head before his features were morphed into Whittaker's.\n\n==Characteristics within the series==\n\n===Relationship with the TARDIS===\nIt is mentioned that the TARDIS assists the Doctor during the regenerative process, as suggested by the Second Doctor's statement to this effect shortly after regenerating from the First. This is reiterated by [[Jack Harkness]]' insistence that the Doctor be taken into the TARDIS having been shot by a Dalek in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\". Of the six occasions on which the Doctor has regenerated outside the TARDIS: one is forced on him by the Time Lords (Second to Third Doctor, ''The War Games''); one requires a Time Lord to give the Doctor's cells a \"little push\" to start the process (Third to Fourth, ''Planet of the Spiders''); one results in his being dependent on the TARDIS's \"Zero Room\", a chamber sealed from all outside forces, to help him recover (Fourth to Fifth, ''Castrovalva''); one occurs a few hours after he has actually \"died\" (Seventh to Eighth, the 1996 television film; the delay at is, however, shown to have been caused by anaesthetic, rather than the Doctor's distance from the TARDIS); one is induced by the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] after reviving the Doctor from actual death (Eighth Doctor, \"The Night of the Doctor\"). The Seventh to Eighth regeneration remains the only one that takes place significantly far away from the TARDIS, without any obvious interaction from other Time Lords and results in the Doctor suffering near-complete [[amnesia]] for nearly a day until an event inside the TARDIS triggers his memories to return. The future Eleventh Doctor is killed in mid-regeneration, showing he is vulnerable to death while regenerating and as such his need for the TARDIS may be for safety rather than aid. However it is later revealed that this regeneration was indeed a simulation since the Doctor who was shot was actually a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Teselecta|Teselecta robot]]. The Eleventh Doctor starts his regeneration outside the TARDIS though he does end it inside it. In the case of the [[Twelfth Doctor]], he briefly begins his regeneration after being shot by a laser from a Mondasian [[Cyberman]] away from the TARDIS, but holds it off. When his actual regeneration starts, he emerges from the TARDIS as he struggles to hold it back. When the Twelfth Doctor finally does regenerate, it is within the TARDIS. As the Doctor contemplates his regeneration, the TARDIS appears to make its opinion on the matter known by flashing its lights at the Doctor, eliciting a response from him.\n\n===Energy release and increased strength===\nThe exact mechanism that makes regeneration possible is not stated in the television series, but it is generally assumed in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] that the ability to regenerate may be linked to what is known as the \"[[Rassilon]] Imprimatur\", the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] nuclei of a Time Lord that bonds him or her to a TARDIS, and allows his or her body to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel (''[[The Two Doctors]]'', 1985).<ref group=note>The [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]]-authored book ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (1991 book)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' attributes regeneration to a \"[[nanotechnology|nanomolecular]] virus\" that rebuilds the body. The audio play ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who)|Zagreus]]'' attributes regeneration to \"self-replicating biogenic molecules\" designed by Rassilon, which do much the same thing, with a built-in limit of twelve regenerations to prevent the molecules' decay. According to the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] book ''[[The Crystal Bucephalus]]'' by [[Craig Hinton]], Time Lords have triple-helix [[DNA]]: the third strand was added by Rassilon to make regeneration possible. The novelisation of [[The Twin Dilemma]] by [[Eric Saward]] states that the regenerative process is triggered by a massive release of the hormone ''lindos'', which is transported at great speed around the Time Lord's body, causing its cells to reform and realign. These varying explanations may or may not be compatible with each other, and like all spin-off media, their [[canon (fiction)#Doctor Who|canonicity]] with respect to the television series is unclear.</ref>\n\nIn \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" (2005) it is stated that the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body, and also shown that residual effects from a regeneration allow him to grow back a hand within the first 15 hours after the initial start of the regeneration. Accordingly, in \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", River Song is able to repel bullets after regenerating. She is later able to send off an energy wave soon after her regeneration, though this particular feat may be one of the abilities gained during this time.\n\nIn the series four finale of the revived series, \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", an injured [[Tenth Doctor]] manages to avert a full regeneration by channelling \"excess regenerative energy\" into his severed hand, allowing him to heal without changing form. The limb ends up developing into a half-human clone when Donna Noble touches it; the event, a \"two-way\" \"Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis\", also gives Donna a Time Lord's mind.\n\nIncreased strength is sometimes a temporary by-product of regeneration. Shortly after his third regeneration, the [[Fourth Doctor]] karate-chopped a brick in half in episode one of [[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]], but was unable to repeat the action later in the same serial. In the moments following his regeneration into his [[Eighth Doctor|eighth incarnation]], the Doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a steel door completely off its hinges. In \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\", the [[First Doctor]]'s dying of old age had earlier rendered him \"weak as a kitten\", but his oncoming regeneration temporarily provides him with renewed strength and vitality (as explained to him by the [[Twelfth Doctor]]).\n\nIn \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" when the [[Tenth Doctor]] regenerates into the [[Eleventh Doctor]], the release of energy damages the TARDIS to the extent that components fall, the door's windows smash and the TARDIS then flies uncontrollably over Earth before crash-landing in [[Amy Pond]]'s garden. Later, when the Eleventh Doctor begins his regeneration into the [[Twelfth Doctor]] in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", he is able to control his regeneration energy and sends out energy blasts that obliterate nearby [[Dalek]]s and an entire Dalek saucer. The release of energy also causes a shockwave that severely damages the town where the regeneration took place.\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor's regeneration into the Thirteenth is also quite explosive; while the streams of regeneration energy being emitted from the Doctor cause some minor damage to the console room, the full extent is revealed when it begins to explode immediately after the Doctor attempts to operate it, and she ends up falling from the TARDIS.\n\n===Personality change===\nWith regeneration also comes a change of personality. The viewing audience sees this most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the Doctor's various incarnations. The Doctor's core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained, but in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" the Tenth Doctor laments that demise of his current incarnation, with its own personality and attributes, makes for something much akin to an actual death. His last words before regenerating are \"I don't want to go.\"\n\nShortly after the regeneration process, the Doctor sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability. The Fourth Doctor described it as \"a new body is like a new house - takes a little bit of time to settle in\". The Second Doctor experiences crippling pain after his first regeneration (in ''The Power of the Daleks''), while the Third Doctor collapses outside the TARDIS following his regeneration (in ''Spearhead from Space''). The Fourth Doctor started rambling random phrases and possessed a higher than usual strength; he could cut a brick in half merely with his hand (in ''Robot''). The Fifth Doctor (in ''Castrovalva'') begins reverting to his previous personalities, and the Sixth Doctor experiences extreme [[paranoia]], flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion (''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'', 1984). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia as a result of post-regeneration trauma (the 1996 [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|television film]]); uniquely, the Doctor was \"not alive\" at the time of this regeneration. The regeneration from the Ninth to the Tenth Doctor sees the Doctor experiencing sudden spasms and great pain (\"[[Doctor Who: Children in Need|Children in Need special]]\"), and later being unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (\"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"). The regeneration from the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor caused the Doctor to experience strange food cravings, only to be disgusted by them upon actually trying them (\"The Eleventh Hour\"). The Twelfth Doctor forgot how to fly the TARDIS (as well as the name of the TARDIS) right after the regeneration process in [[The Time of the Doctor]]. ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' implies that Time Lords other than the Doctor may experience difficult regenerations, since the Sisterhood of Karn had been supplying them with an \"[[elixir of life]]\" that could assist the process. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Sisterhood tell the [[Eighth Doctor]] they can provide elixirs to give rise to non-random regenerations, allowing the Doctor to specify either a physical type or personality.\n\nThe Master showed a dramatic personality change upon regenerating into the Mistress/Missy. In that form, she wants nothing more than to renew her bond with the Doctor, even calling him her \"boyfriend\" at one point. (\"Deep Breath, Death in Heaven\") When she met him again, Missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately. (\"Dark Water\") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust. In turn, though Missy expressed a love for who she was in her past incarnation, she forced his own regeneration into her to ensure she would become the person she now was (\"[[The Doctor Falls]]\").\n\n===Extent of physical change===\nThe Doctor has always regenerated into a humanoid form. However, when explaining the process of regeneration to [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] at the end of \"The Parting of the Ways\", the Ninth Doctor suggests that his new form could have \"two heads\", or even \"no head\", and in the 2005 [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|Children in Need special]], which takes place immediately after that episode, the newly regenerated Tenth Doctor, while examining his new body, makes a point of checking that he has two arms, two legs and two hands, implying that regenerations can sometimes result in physically deformed or non-humanoid forms; similarly, the Eleventh Doctor, upon regenerating, shows relief to still have legs and proceeds to check whether he still has fingers and human facial features. It is not clear whether or not these moments are intended as jokes. The beginning of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) featured Romana trying out a number of potential forms, two of which included a blue-skinned pygmy and a giantess.\n\nWhether Time Lords could change gender in regeneration was never addressed onscreen during the classic series and not explicitly focused on for much of the revival. In ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'' (1976), the Kastrian Eldrad compared his transformation from female to male to Time Lord regeneration, possibly suggesting the process could produce a sex change. The concept of Time Lords changing gender upon regeneration was seeded throughout Moffat's tenure as showrunner. In the second part of \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2010), the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) briefly checks for an Adam's apple upon regeneration to confirm if he is still a man. In the 2011 episode \"[[The Doctor's Wife]]\", the Doctor recalls a Time Lord acquaintance known as the Corsair, who had at least two female incarnations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/08/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-doctors-wife|title='Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About 'The Doctor's Wife' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref> In the 2013 short \"[[Night of the Doctor]]\", the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] offer a dying [[Eighth Doctor]] ([[Paul McGann]]) control over his inevitable regeneration, with \"man or woman\" being touted as possibilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/11/doctor-who-making-sense-of-the-night-of-the-doctor|title='Doctor Who': Making Sense of 'The Night of the Doctor' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref> The first on-screen cross-gender regeneration was shown in the 2015 episode \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", in which a white male Gallifreyan general ([[Ken Bones]]) regenerates into a black woman (T'Nia Miller), who states that her previous incarnation was the only time she had been a man.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/dec/05/doctor-who-series-35-episode-12-hell-bent|title=Doctor Who, series 35, episode 12 \u2013 Hell Bent|last=Martin|first=Dan|date=5 December 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe most notable Time Lord to have appeared in both male and female forms prior to Whittaker's casting is the Doctor's nemesis, [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], portrayed from 2014 to 2017 by Scottish actress [[Michelle Gomez]]. This character was known as Missy, short for \"Mistress\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-11-01/doctor-who-dark-water-review-gender-reassignment-and-life-after-death-launch-a-challenging-finale|title=Doctor Who Dark Water review: Gender reassignment and life after death launch a challenging finale|work=RadioTimes|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref> In \"[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]\" (2017), the Doctor tells his companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]], in reference to Missy, that Time Lords are mostly beyond gender norms and stereotypes; however, Bill points out that the males and females of the species collectively refer to themselves by a male title. From \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" onward, [[Jodie Whittaker]] portrays the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], the Doctor's first female incarnation.\n\nFemale Doctors were previously explored in spin-off productions; [[Joanna Lumley]] appeared as a satirical version of the Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 [[Comic Relief]] special ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death|The Curse of Fatal Death]]''. [[Arabella Weir]] also played an alternate [[Third Doctor]] in the ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] episode ''[[Exile (audio drama)|Exile]]''. Neither portrayal is typically considered to be within the show's main continuity.<ref name=\"Peck 2013\">{{cite web|first1=Matthew Wace|last1=Peck|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/355731|title=Op-Ed: Is the new Doctor Who a woman?|work=Digital Journal|publisher=digitaljournal.com|date=August 3, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> Spin-off media have also depicted more drastic regenerations than the TV series. For example, in the Big Finish Productions audio ''[[Circular Time]]'', a Time Lord known as Cardinal Zero regenerates into an [[Bird|avian]] life-form after being poisoned.<ref>[http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf91.htm \"Circular Time\"], ''Doctor Who Reference Guide''. Retrieved on 11 July 2015.</ref>\n\n===Control over regeneration===\nThe Doctor's regenerations are always involuntary, and he has no control over his final appearance. In \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005), the Ninth Doctor describes the process as \"a bit dodgy\"\u2014i.e., somewhat dangerous or uncertain\u2014and the Tenth Doctor refers to regeneration as \"a lottery\" (\"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", 2013). For example, despite an apparent wish for this to occur, neither the Ninth nor the Tenth Doctors regenerated into [[red hair|redheads]]. The sole known exception to this is the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (\"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", 2013), as the Doctor was able to consume a potion made by the Sisterhood of Karn which ensured his next body was a warrior able to fight in the last Great Time War, though he didn't appear to make any specifications about the actual physical appearance. The Doctor was also once given the chance to choose his appearance upon his forced regeneration by the Time Lords in ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969) but rejected all of the options presented to him. The Time Lords grew tired of his stalling and thus sent him away to regenerate into the [[Third Doctor]], an apparently random result. Alternatively, the Tenth Doctor was shown twice to exert control over regenerating, attributed by the Eleventh Doctor to \"having vanity issues at the time.\" In \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008), after being shot by a Dalek triggered a regeneration, the Tenth Doctor used the regeneration energy to heal his wounds, then channelled the remaining energy into his severed hand and purposely kept his current appearance. When he finally did regenerate into the Eleventh Doctor, he still consciously prevented himself from regenerating to prolong his time as his current incarnation for several hours. Doing this caused a more explosive regeneration that nearly destroyed the TARDIS.\n\nIn contrast, the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) depicts Romana undergoing a voluntary regeneration, in which she tries out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a person she encountered in a previous adventure (''[[The Armageddon Factor]]''). Many writers of spin-off media have attempted to rationalise the difference between the Doctor's and Romana's regenerations. ''Doctor Who'' television writer and script editor [[Eric Saward]] suggests in his 1985 novelisation of ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'' (1984) that Time Lords can control the appearance of their next body if they trigger the regeneration voluntarily, but not if the regeneration is caused by death or injury. [[The Doctor Who Role Playing Game]] by FASA suggests that some Time Lords have a special ability to control their regenerations. The fan reference book ''[[The Discontinuity Guide]]'' suggests that Romana's various \"try-ons\" were projections of potential future incarnations like the K'anpo Rinpoche/Cho Je situation in ''Planet of the Spiders''.<ref name=\"discontinuity\">{{cite book\n | author=Paul Cornell |author2=Martin Day |author3-link=Keith Topping |author3=Keith Topping\n | year = 2004\n | title = The Discontinuity Guide\n | edition = 2nd\n | location = Austin, TX\n | publisher=[[MonkeyBrain Books]]\n | chapter = Destiny of the Daleks\n | chapterurl = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/destinydaleks/detail.shtml\n | format = reprinted on BBC ''Doctor Who'' website\n | accessdate = 21 April 2009\n | isbn = 1-932265-09-0\n | page = 234\n|author2-link=Martin Day |author-link=Paul Cornell |title-link=The Discontinuity Guide }}</ref> Miles and Wood's ''About Time'' also mentions this while theorising that the Time Lords had improved the technology of regeneration since the Doctor's time; Romana, being of a later generation than the Doctor, would therefore have finer control over the regenerative process in its early stages.<ref name=\"about time 4\">{{cite book\n | author=Lawrence Miles\n |author2=Tat Wood \n |date=December 2004\n | title = About Time 4: The Unauthorized Guide to Doctor Who (Seasons 12 to 17)\n | pages = 270\u2013271\n | location = New Orleans\n | publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]]\n | isbn = 0-9759446-3-0\n|author2-link=Tat Wood \n |author-link=Lawrence Miles \n }}</ref>\n\nOther moments in the series suggest that other Time Lords have more control over their regeneration than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), the Master expresses a desire to be \"young and strong\" like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" (2008), the Doctor begins to regenerate in a [[cliffhanger]] moment, but at the start of \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", when Mels begins to regenerate into [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying \"I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can.\" (Even though by ''The Time Of The Doctor'' this was revealed to be a bluff due to the fact that the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" (2017), the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.\n\nIn \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor reveals that there is a period of time, what he calls \"a state of grace,\" when a regenerating Time Lord's current incarnation is restored to full health for a time if the incarnation resists regeneration. During this time, the incarnation must choose whether or not to regenerate. Once the period is over, if the Time Lord chooses not to regenerate, they will permanently die. Furthermore, as time passes during this \"state of grace,\" the Time Lord grows weaker as the period nears its end. The First, Tenth and Twelfth Doctors all used this period of time, though in the case of the Tenth Doctor it was to visit all of his former companions a final time before regenerating rather than out of some form of uncertainty. While in his \"state of grace,\" the First Doctor's face got \"mixed up\" due to his resisting regeneration, an effect not seen with his subsequent incarnations who used the period.\n\n===Recognition of the regenerated===\nThe television series is inconsistent on the question of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in ''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'' (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (though the Doctor takes a while to remember Drax).\n\nThere is also inconsistency as to whether the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in ''The Five Doctors'', the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In ''[[Time Crash]]'', after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a [[predestination paradox]] to cancel out a universe-destroying [[black hole]] with a [[supernova]] by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in ''The Day of the Doctor,'' the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers. When the First Doctor meets the Twelfth Doctor, the First Doctor sees his future self as another Time Lord come to take back his TARDIS and requires convincing as to otherwise.\n\nThe Daleks' ability to recognise the Doctor also varies: they recognise him outright in ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' but need confirmation from other sources in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" and \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\". In \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\", the Daleks' knowledge of the Doctor is tied to a psychic link among them called the path-web, which is hacked to make them forget him. The [[Cybermen]] have their own method of recognising the Doctor, usually through his past incarnations, as seen in ''[[Earthshock]]'' and \"[[The Next Doctor]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", while the Master was under the chameleon arch, the Doctor could not sense that he was a Time Lord. After the Master's personality reasserted itself, the Doctor instantly sensed him and could tell which Time Lord it was without being told. In \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", the Doctor stated that he would be able to recognize the regenerated Master on sight despite having never seen his new incarnation, claiming that Time Lords could always recognize each other. Due to the Master's Archangel Network, the Doctor's ability to sense another Time Lord had been blocked up to that point. During \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", the Master and the Doctor could sense each other's presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out. However, this ability has a limited range as stated by the Doctor to Wilfred Mott. While he could sense that the Master was still on Earth, he could not tell where he was as the Master was too far away to track precisely. In \"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\", The Doctor failed to recognize that Missy was a regeneration of The Master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a Time Lord at all until she revealed her identity to him. In \"[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]\", the disguised Master figured out that Missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from her mannerisms rather than any sort of special ability. In turn, Missy did not realize that the disguised Master was another Time Lord, let alone her own past self until he revealed himself.\n\n===Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle===\nIn ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), it is established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This statement is later repeated in ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|TV film]] and \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Berriman|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/10/26/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|title=Interview: Russell T Davies Talks About THAT Sarah Jane Adventures Line|publisher=SFX.co.uk|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/steven-moffat-on-doctor-numbers-and-the-regeneration-limit|title=Steven Moffat on 'Doctor numbers' and the regeneration limit|author=Darren Scott|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>  In the BBC Series 4 FAQ, writer Russell T Davies made a joke that<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|publisher=BBC|title= Series 4 FAQ}}</ref> suggested that since the Time Lords were believed to be dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: \"Now that his people are gone, who knows?

Davies talks about THAT Sarah Jane Adventures line|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the series has depicted exceptions to this rule in the career of the renegade Time Lord the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]. When the Master finds himself at the end of his regenerative cycle in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981), he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living, although he was using the Source of Traken to bind his mind to the body. In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983), the Master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council of the Time Lords in exchange for his help. In the 1996 television movie, the Master temporarily inhabits the body of a human, and attempts to take the Doctor's remaining regenerations. In \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" (2007), the Master is revealed to have been granted a new body by the Time Lords during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In this new body, the Master appears to have a new regeneration cycle. The Master regenerates in \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007) and \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" (2017) with dialogue in the latter episode suggesting he has at least one more regeneration.\n\nThe number of previous incarnations of the Doctor was at first unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), the Doctor participates in a mental \u2018duel\u2019 with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project the faces of the \"losing\" contestant\u2019s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]] that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=20 August 2013|url=http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Zepo_2.htm|title=The Many Faces of the Doctor: Body Counts and Contextualization in 'The Brain of Morbius'}}</ref> However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries \"How far Doctor? How long have you lived?\", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.<ref>Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012).

Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. {{ISBN|978-193523411-1}}.</ref>\n\nIn other episodes, it was firmly established that the [[William Hartnell]] incarnation of the Doctor was the very first. In ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', the Time Lord President describes the Hartnell incarnation as \"the earliest Doctor\". This is cemented in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' when Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor (introducing himself to the First Doctor) says that he is the fourth regeneration, meaning that there have been five of him. The First Doctor also refers to himself as \"the original\".  Episodes of the revival series showing the lives of the Doctor -- \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Husbands of River Song]]\"\u2014all begin with the William Hartnell incarnation. In \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\", the William Hartnell incarnation is depicted as indeed being the very first incarnation with the First Doctor expressing fear about undergoing his very first regeneration throughout the story.\n\nIn \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", after the Eleventh Doctor shows Craig who he is, he points to his face and says, \"Eleventh\". However, in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", when the Doctor rescues Clara from inside his own time stream, they both see another figure that Clara doesn't recognise. The Doctor then reveals that this is a [[War Doctor|past incarnation]] that he deemed unworthy of the name \"Doctor\" due to the atrocities he committed during the Time War, and only accepted him after learning the truth of how the war ended (\"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\").<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=25 December 2013|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-25/doctor-who-the-time-of-the-doctor-review|title=Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor review'}}</ref> Ultimately, in \"The Time of the Doctor\" the Eleventh Doctor reveals that, counting the War Doctor and the [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]]'s [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|aborted regeneration]], he is actually in his final incarnation, reaching a point where he is dying of old age after centuries of conflict with the Daleks and others on the planet Trenzalore. However, at the behest of Clara, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, allowing a thirteenth regeneration into an incarnation known as the [[Twelfth Doctor]]. The Twelfth Doctor is later able to regenerate into a female incarnation known as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] after suffering fatal injuries during a battle.\n\nIn \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Eleventh Doctor describes his new regeneration ability as the start of a new 'cycle', implying that he's been restored to the customary twelve regenerations. However, in \"[[Kill the Moon]]\", the Twelfth Doctor says he's \"not entirely sure [he] won't keep regenerating forever,\" once again raising the question regarding any limits to this ability. In \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", Rassilon asks the Doctor \"How many regenerations did we grant you?\", and during \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\", two incarnations of the Master express uncertainty about how long it would take them to kill the Doctor, further implying that the Doctor has a finite number of regenerations even as the exact amount remains undetermined.\n\nIn \"[[The Timeless Children]]\", it is revealed that the Doctor is the Timeless Child, a being who predated the Time Lords and who can regenerate an unlimited number of times.\n\n===Temporary potential future incarnations===\nIn some cases, future potential incarnations can achieve independent, though temporary, existence. In ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'', a Time Lord, K'anpo Rinpoche, creates a corporeal projection of a future incarnation which has such an existence under the name Cho Je until he regenerates into that incarnation. The [[Valeyard]], an \"amalgamation of the darker sides of [the Doctor's] nature, somewhere between [his] twelfth and final incarnation\", appears in ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' (1986) opposite the [[Sixth Doctor]]; the Valeyard is promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations. Another example is [[Watcher (Doctor Who)|\"The Watcher\"]], who repeatedly appears to the Fourth Doctor in ''[[Logopolis]]'' (1981), and ultimately merges with him as part of his regeneration into his [[Fifth Doctor|fifth incarnation]].\n\nThe Time Lords' ability to change species during regeneration is referred to in the television movie by the Eighth Doctor in relation to the Master. Mavic Chen states that the First Doctor's resemblance to an Earth creature is \"only a disguise\" in ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' (1965). In ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), the Fourth Doctor's Time Lady companion [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] demonstrates an apparent ability to \"try on\" different bodies from a number of different species during her regeneration, before settling on a final, humanoid form which physically resembles [[The Armageddon Factor|Princess Astra of Atrios]].\n\nSteven Moffat has said that reference will be made to Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the [[Whoniverse]] during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: \"The face is not set from birth. It\u2019s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that\u2019s the case because in ''[[The War Games]]'' he has a choice of faces. So we know it\u2019s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can\u2019t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he\u2019ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?\u201d{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In \"[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]\" (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\" (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision to save the life of Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\" (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.\n\n===Regeneration of non-Gallifreyans===\nThe fact that the Master is inhabiting a non-Gallifreyan body when he is offered a new cycle of regenerations (see above) implies that it is possible to grant them to a non-Gallifreyan, albeit one inhabited by a Time Lord mind. In addition, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] is shown to have the ability to regenerate due to altered DNA that has similarities to Time Lord DNA, a side effect  of having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it travelled through the spacetime vortex. Non-Gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in ''[[Underworld (Doctor Who)|Underworld]]'' (1978) and ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), but with adverse side effects. In ''Mawdryn Undead'', these appear to be the result of mishandling stolen technology, but in ''Underworld'' they are implied to be the inevitable result of limited technology that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subject's appearance (in this case, the [[Minyans]], with whom the Time Lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating 'the body, not the soul'.\n\n===Failed/fake regeneration===\nIt has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in ''Planet of the Spiders'', the Third Doctor's regeneration requires \"a little push\" from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in ''The Caves of Androzani'', the Fifth Doctor says, \"I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time... is this death?\" He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under [[anaesthesia]] at the time of his \"death\" could have \"destroyed the regenerative process\", and that he was \"dead too long this time\" prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios \u2013 in \"The End of Time\" \u2013 he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and \"a new man\" walks away). In ''The Mind of Evil'' the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to \"put a bullet through both [his] hearts,\" while in \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] (he drowned without his future companion [[Donna Noble]] there to inspire him to leave), a [[UNIT]] member speculates that the death of the Doctor \"must have happened too fast for him to regenerate\". In \"The End of Time\", the Doctor explains to [[Wilfred Mott]] that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.\n\nIn the Series 6 premiere, \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\", a future version of the [[Eleventh Doctor]] is shot twice by the titular astronaut and begins to regenerate. However he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only can he be killed before regeneration, but also during the process (However, the later revelation, in \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" that what was shot was in fact a mechanical avatar of the Doctor and not the real person calls this into question). In the episode \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", the Doctor is poisoned by [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when River gives up her remaining regenerations to save him. \"The Time of the Doctor\" later shows that the Doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway.\n\nIn the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Eighth Doctor is killed when the ship he is on crashes onto the planet Karn, reinforcing the idea that a sudden, traumatic death may prevent regeneration. The Sisterhood of Karn explain that he was, in fact, dead, but they were able to use their Time Lord-based technology to revive him and force a regeneration anyway.\n\nIn \"[[Heaven Sent (Doctor Who)|Heaven Sent]]\", the Twelfth Doctor is badly burned by the Veil, preventing him from regenerating properly. However, as his island prison resets itself after leaving a room, he used what was left of his life to download a past version of himself out of the teleporter's hard drive, which also reset. This cycle of bringing himself back to life by burning his current body as energy for the process continued for approximately 4.5 billion years, according to the episode \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]].\"\n\nIn \"[[The Lie of the Land (Doctor Who)|The Lie of the Land]]\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration after his companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]] shoots him after he pretends to be siding with the Monks. The bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, and the whole thing was a test by the Doctor to see if Bill was under the Monks' influence.\n\n===Transference of regenerative energy===\nIn ''Mawdryn Undead'', it is first stated that a Time Lord can transfer his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn to give up his future regenerations in order to cure [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Tegan Jovanka]] from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]]), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a Time Lord. It is not until \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\" that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead [[Eleventh Doctor]]. The favour is returned in \"[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]\" in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy despite it later being revealed that the Doctor is out of regenerations at that point.\n\nA major plot point of the 1996 TV movie involves the Master scheming to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations for himself.\n\nThe Tenth Doctor also consciously aborts a regeneration in \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" and instead transfers the energy to his previously severed hand (from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), which had been saved in a container by Captain Jack Harkness; when Donna Noble touches it, it creates an entirely new person - a \"meta-crisis\" half-human Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor confirms, before himself regenerating during the events of \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", that this action used up a full regeneration.\n\nIn \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\", the [[Twelfth Doctor]] offers a small amount of regenerative energy to [[Daleks|Dalek]] creator [[Davros]] to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer. The Doctor says that doing so \"may cost [him] an arm or a leg down the road\". Davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the Doctor to revitalize himself and transform the Daleks on [[Skaro]] into superior hybrid creatures. His plan backfires when decaying Daleks\u2014incapable of dying, and kept in an underground 'sewer' system when their effective 'lives' have expired\u2014are also reenergized and attack the Daleks on the surface. The Doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.\n\n==Regenerations depicted in the series==\n\n===The Doctor's regenerations===\n[[File:10's regeneration.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Tenth Doctor's explosive regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor.]]\n\n# [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]): Weakened by the [[Cyberman|Cybermen's]] draining of Earth's energy in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966).

All other incarnations were killed. In \"[[The Timeless Children]]\" (2020), it is established that the Doctor has infinite regeneration cycles.\n\n===Romana's regenerations===<!-- This section is linked from [[Romana (Doctor Who)]] -->\n[[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]]'s [[tongue-in-cheek]] regeneration scene in ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) contrasts markedly with the Doctor's transformations. In the first episode of the serial, Romana undergoes regeneration, in the process trying out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a character she encountered in a previous adventure (''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'').\n\nMultiple attempts have been made in the spin-off media to explain the necessity for Romana's regeneration.\n* In the short story \"The Lying Old Witch in the Wardrobe\" by [[Mark Michalowski]], published in the [[Big Finish Productions]] anthology, ''[[Short Trips: Companions]]'', unknown to the Doctor, Romana suffers damage due to exposure to [[the Key to Time]]. Just as she is about to regenerate, a humanoid manifestation of the TARDIS, jealous of Romana, traps her in a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]]. It proceeds to pretend to be Romana, changing into different forms until finally becoming a double of Princess Astra. This manifestation is the one who appears in ''Destiny of the Daleks''. Realising the error of its ways after that adventure, it releases Romana, but not before making the female Time Lord assume the image of Astra.\n* The second explanation is given in the [[Gallifrey (audio series)|''Gallifrey'' audio series]]. ''Gallifrey: Lies'' by [[Gary Russell]] reveals that Romana forced her own regeneration to prevent an ancient Gallifreyan evil called Pandora from gaining power over her (see also [[History of the Time Lords#Audio plays|History of the Time Lords \u2013 Audio plays]]).\n* The third explanation is in the [[Fifth Doctor]] audio story ''[[The Chaos Pool]]'' by [[Peter Anghelides]], which states that the creators of the Key to Time re-disguised its final segment as Romana, which is why she changed and why she chose Astra's form.\n\n===The Master's regenerations===\nThe [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] has only been shown to regenerate once onscreen. However, the Master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon Time Lords. Originally played by [[Roger Delgado]], his decrepit later appearance (following Delgado's death) in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976) is explained as owing to the fact that he is in his final regeneration. He is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of Tremas (Antony Ainley) in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981). Ainley portrays the Master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle. In the 1996 [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|TV movie]], the Master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]), giving the Master another new form.\n\nWhen the Master is reintroduced in 2007, exposition explains he was resurrected by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War, apparently with a new regeneration cycle. In \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), he is fatally shot by his assistant and changes from a form known as Professor Yana, played by [[Derek Jacobi]], into a new incarnation, played by [[John Simm]]. Before regenerating, the Master expresses desire to become \"young and strong\" like the [[Tenth Doctor]]. A character named Missy first appears in \"[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]\" (2014) before being revealed as the Master in \"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" (2014), having regenerated off-screen during the character's absence. For most of Missy's appearances, it is unknown how the Master regenerated into her. It is later revealed in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" that it was Missy herself who forced the regeneration. In an effort to ensure that she would come into existence and stand with the Doctor, Missy stabbed the Master in the back to trigger his regeneration, but made the wound \"precise\" so that he would have time to reach his TARDIS before the regeneration began. In return, the Master killed Missy with his laser screwdriver and stated that he'd disabled her regeneration so that she would die permanently of the shot. Though the Master's regeneration into Missy was left inevitable, it was not shown on-screen. However, Missy was unsure if that particular incarnation would regenerate into her directly, being afflicted with memory loss resultant from the crossing of their respective timelines.\n\nIn several of the short stories published in the ''Doctor Who'' universe, some regenerations for the Master are seen including two separate reasons for the Roger Delgado incarnation's regeneration. In the short story ''Pandoric's Box'', the Master is depicted as regenerating into Missy due to his battle with Rassilon who also regenerated as predicted by the Moment. However, this is contradicted by \"[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]\" and \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\".\n\n===River Song's regenerations===\n[[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], also known as Melody Pond has regenerated twice throughout the course of the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]]. Although she is human and the daughter of [[Amy Pond]] (hence her surname) and [[Rory Williams]], she was conceived on their wedding night aboard the [[TARDIS]] and therefore was born with genetic traits similar to the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords.\n\nIn \"[[Day of the Moon]]\" (2011), Melody Pond as a child (Sydney Wade) walks through a New York City alley at the end of the episode in early 1970, suffering from an unknown illness. When a vagrant asks of her condition, she explains that all is well, that she is dying, but she can fix it. She subsequently begins to regenerate in the style of the revived series as the vagrant flees in terror.\n\nIn \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (Maya Glace-Green). This form later matured into Amy Pond's best friend, Mels ([[Nina Toussaint-White]]), who regenerated into her more widely known River Song (Alex Kingston) identity after being shot. In the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, Melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy.  In that same episode, River Song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the Doctor; as Amy put it \"You're safe now. Apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that.\" She was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate. In \"[[The Husbands of River Song]]\", it is revealed that River possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but it is never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part-Time Lord physiology or something she obtained from other means.\n\n===Other regenerations===\n\nIn \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015), while threatened with a gun, the General states to the Doctor that he is currently in his tenth regeneration. The Doctor then shoots him, causing him to regenerate from an old white man into a younger black woman. The General later states that her previous incarnation was her only one as a male.\n\nIn \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), the Doctor's DNA is used to create the titular \"daughter\" [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] ([[Georgia Tennant]]), who displays many but not all Time Lord traits. In the episode's close, she is shot in the chest and appears to die. However, long after the Doctor and his companions have departed, she miraculously resurrects and expels energy from her mouth which, ambiguously enough, both resembles regenerative energy and the energy emitted by a planet-restoring plot device in the same episode. The question as to whether this is a true regeneration is left unanswered, since Jenny does not change her appearance.\n\nIn \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2009/2010), the Master attacks the Lord President [[Rassilon]] with energy bolts, bringing Rassilon to his knees. By the time of his next appearance in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", Rassilon has regenerated into a much older incarnation. In the short story ''Pandoric's Box'', it is confirmed that the Master's attack prompted this regeneration as predicted by the Moment.\n\nIn the premiere of the 2009 spin-off series ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'', the original K-9 Mark I (Leeson) is reintroduced and destroyed, but subsequently revealed to have been installed with a \"regeneration circuit\". At this point, the traditional K-9 model \"regenerates\" into a more sophisticated-looking CGI model.\n\n=== Visual effects === \n \nEach new regeneration was also radically different from the previous one, even in terms of the visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of ''The Tenth Planet'' and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'', retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.\n\nEach subsequent regeneration was then filmed in a variety of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode. Indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the [[Russell T Davies]] era. Only BBC Wales ''Doctor Who'' attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked. Ever since \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005), every regeneration has been portrayed as a \"golden glow explosion\" (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in \"The Parting of the Ways\" and is milky white in \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\"). Rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying \"I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him\" to the Tenth Doctor immediately after the Ninth Doctor regenerated. Also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, to the point where the most powerful occurrences, seen in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" and \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", were able to destroy the Tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a Dalek ship along with several troops respectively. Each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the Doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed. In smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in wisps of golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others. The subsequent Children in Need Special established that there was residual \"regeneration energy\" in a gaseous state after a transformation that had to be expelled through the mouth. This was seen again in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" \u2014 though the latter narrative never made quite clear that Jenny actually regenerated. The Tenth Doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the Eleventh Doctor. Consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy. Also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and Time Lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion. Directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a Dalek Saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any Dalek troops in the vicinity. The actual regeneration of the Eleventh Doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration. When regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the Doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy.\n\nThis visual standardisation has allowed narratives to play around with regeneration. The mere presence of \"regeneration energy\" can now be used to heighten dramatic tension. This visual short cut, unavailable to production teams in the classic era, has been a particular favourite of [[Steven Moffat]], who used the \"golden glow\" liberally throughout the 2011 series; in fact, unlike in the Russell T Davies era, in which nearly every regeneration had subtle differences, every Moffat era regeneration until \"The Time of the Doctor\" is nearly identical. Several of the 2011 episodes used that VFX in a way that wordlessly suggested regeneration.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n*[[Time Lord#Physical characteristics|Time Lord physical characteristics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://meshyfish.com/~roo/docwho1.html Rassilon, Omega, and that Other guy: Gallifrey Stuff] \u2013 every fact about the Time Lords no matter how apocryphal\n\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n\n[[Category:Time Lords]]\n[[Category:Fictional superhuman features or abilities]]\n[[Category:Reincarnation in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=May 2011}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Regeneration (''Doctor Who'')}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn the long-running [[British television science fiction|British science fiction television series]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'', '''regeneration''' is a biological ability exhibited by the [[Time Lord]]s, a race of fictional [[humanoid]]s originating on the planet [[Gallifrey]]. This process allows a Time Lord  to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the show as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting reasons.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor|current incarnation]] of the Doctor is played by [[Jodie Whittaker]], following the regeneration of the [[Twelfth Doctor]] (portrayed by [[Peter Capaldi]]) during the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n==Conceptual history==\n\n===Inspiration===\n\nThe concept of regeneration was created in 1966 by the writers of ''Doctor Who'' as a method of replacing the leading actor. The role of the Doctor had been played by [[William Hartnell]] since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that Hartnell's health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with. Producer [[John Wiles]] had, following several clashes with Hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in ''[[The Celestial Toymaker]]''; during two episodes of that serial, the Doctor is invisible (owing to Hartnell being on holiday during the recording). Wiles' plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor. This proposal was vetoed by [[Gerald Savory]], the BBC's Head of Serials (and Wiles' superior), which led to Wiles leaving before ''The Celestial Toymaker'' was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/season3.shtml |title=Classic Episodes: Season 3|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |website=BBC Doctor Who |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> However, it was apparent that it would not be possible for Hartnell to continue for much longer.\n\nOn 29 July 1966, production concluded on the final episode of ''[[The Smugglers]]'', the last serial recorded in the [[Doctor Who (season 3)|third production block]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} During production, Hartnell and producer [[Innes Lloyd]] had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would be the first one produced as part of [[Doctor Who (season 4)|Season 4]]. Script editor [[Gerry Davis (screenwriter)|Gerry Davis]] proposed that, since the Doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body. Lloyd took this further by suggesting that the Doctor could do this \"renewal\" regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The process itself was modelled on [[LSD]] trips, with the experience being like the \"hell and dank horror\" of taking the drug.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/8616413.stm |work=BBC News | title=LSD inspired Doctor regeneration | date=12 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', the [[First Doctor]] collapses from apparent old age and exhaustion, having commented earlier that his body was \"wearing a bit thin\". Then, before the eyes of his companions [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]] and [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]], and of the viewing audience, his features shift into that of the [[Second Doctor]], played by [[Patrick Troughton]]. In ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'', the Second Doctor's first story, the Doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.<ref name=\"power\">{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/powerdaleks/detail.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The Power of the Daleks \u2013 Details| accessdate=1 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Developing the concept===\nIt was not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the Doctor's as opposed to a process initiated by technology. In ''Power of the Daleks'', the Second Doctor describes his renewal as a function of his [[TARDIS]] [[Time travel|time machine]], stating that \"without it, [he] couldn't survive.\"<ref name=\"power\" />\n\nWhen Troughton left the series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, but this time the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the conclusion of ''[[The War Games]]'', where it is referred to as a \"change of appearance\". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although [[Jon Pertwee]]'s portrayal of the [[Third Doctor]] also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in ''The War Games'' the Doctor protests, \"You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!\"\n\nAs the series continued, more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced, but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of ''[[Planet of the Spiders]] ''(1974)'', ''when Pertwee's Third Doctor turns into [[Tom Baker]]'s [[Fourth Doctor]]. In this scene, the change is called \"regeneration\" for the first time, and is explained as a biological process that occurs when a Time Lord's body is dying. It is also stated that following the regeneration the Doctor's brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be \"erratic\" for a time, something that would be evident for most subsequent regenerations.\n\nIn the ''About Time'' reference series [[Lawrence Miles]] and [[Tat Wood]] note that the officially licensed magazine, ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Monthly]]'', stated in a \"Matrix Data-Bank\" column in 1982 that its readers should not confuse the \"regenerations\" of later incarnations with the \"rejuvenation\" of Hartnell into Troughton.<ref name=\"about time 3\">{{cite book\n | author=Lawrence Miles\n |author2=Tat Wood \n |date=October 2004\n | title = About Time 3: The Unauthorized Guide to Doctor Who (Seasons 7 to 11)\n | location = New Orleans\n | publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]]\n | isbn = 0-9725959-2-9\n | page = 173\n |author2-link=Tat Wood \n |author-link=Lawrence Miles \n }}</ref> However, dialogue within the series itself explicitly includes the First-to-Second \"rejuvenation\" when enumerating the Doctor's regenerations (for example in ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983)).\n\nIn ''[[The Timeless Children]]'', it is explained that the Timelords got their regeneration ability from an unknown person called The Timeless Child, a child found by an explorer called Techteun who has seemingly infinite regenerations. Techteun splices the regeneration ability from The Timeless Child across all Timelords. It is revealed The Timeless Child is The Doctor, and that her thirteen lives (by the point of this episode) are not her only ones and she has lived an unknown number of previous lives.\n\n===Transitions===\n[[File:Regeneration 4-5.gif|thumb|The Fourth Doctor regenerates into the Fifth Doctor (from ''[[Logopolis]]'', 1981, and ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', 1982)]]\nThe regeneration \"effect\" was accomplished during the series' original run from 1963\u20131989 primarily through the use of [[Superimposing|video mixing]]. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of ''The Tenth Planet'' with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be [[Clipping (photography)|overexposed]] to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of ''The Tenth Planet'', and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSubsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects. The transition from the Fourth to the [[Fifth Doctor]] used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the Watcher, but aside from this, other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the incoming actor on top of the outgoing one. The transition from the [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] to the [[Eighth Doctor]] in the [[Doctor Who (1996)|1996 television movie]] took advantage of the higher budget and modern [[computer generated imagery|computer animation]] technology to [[morphing|\"morph\"]] the features of [[Sylvester McCoy]] into those of [[Paul McGann]].\n\nWith the exception of the transitions from the Second to Third, each regeneration was shown on-screen, with the previous incumbent in the role symbolically \"handing off\" the character to the next. The Second Doctor was never seen to actually change into the Third, simply fading off into darkness at the end of ''The War Games'' and then stumbling out of the TARDIS, already regenerated, at the start of ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970).\n\nThe regeneration of the [[Sixth Doctor]] into the Seventh is the only time that a single actor took on the roles of two incarnations of the Doctor. [[Colin Baker]] declined the invitation to film the regeneration sequence at the start of ''[[Time and the Rani]]'' (1987) due to the circumstances in which the BBC dismissed him from the role.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} As a result, Sylvester McCoy had to don his predecessor's costume and a blond curly wig, lying face down, with the mixing effect to the Doctor's \"new\" features occurring as he was turned over.\n\nThe 2005 series, which revived the programme after its cancellation 16 years earlier, began with the Ninth Doctor already regenerated and no explanation given as to the circumstances behind the change (although a scene in the debut episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" when the Doctor commented on his appearance in a mirror indicated that the change had recently occurred). In the documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', producer [[Russell T Davies]] explained his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would be not only confusing for new viewers but also lacking in dramatic impact, as there would have been no emotional investment in the character being replaced.<ref name=\"confidential\">{{cite episode\n | title = Bringing Back the Doctor\n | episodelink = Doctor Who Confidential#Series 1 (2005)\n | series = Doctor Who Confidential\n | serieslink = Doctor Who Confidential\n | credits = Gillane Seaborne\n | network = BBC\n | airdate = 2005-03-26\n}}</ref> The regeneration into the Ninth Doctor was later seen and explained in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" (2013). In this episode, the [[War Doctor]] automatically begins a regeneration due to old age at the end of the Last Great Time War. However, the full transition is not seen with only the start of the regeneration being shown.\n\nThe regeneration of the [[Ninth Doctor]] into the [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] at the end of \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) used computer effects to morph [[Christopher Eccleston]] into [[David Tennant]]. In the episode of ''Doctor Who Confidential'' accompanying the episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), where the same effect is used for [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2010) during which [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] took over the role as the [[Eleventh Doctor]]; in \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"[[Day of the Moon]]\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\" when Mels ([[Nina Toussaint-White]]) is shot and regenerates into [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]). \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]] episode \"[[The Lie of the Land (Doctor Who)|The Lie of the Land]]\", the [[Twelfth Doctor]] fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill]] still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.\n\nThe regeneration from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Doctor slightly differs from other regenerations from the revived series. During \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Eleventh Doctor reveals that he has used all his regenerations and is in fact in his thirteen and final body, leading to his aged appearance during the events of the episode. At the conclusion, the Time Lords grant him a new regeneration cycle, and he begins his thirteenth regeneration in the explosive manner that has become tradition (so explosive that it destroys invading Dalek forces including a ship and the village of Christmas in the process). However, as this regeneration is the first in a new cycle, it initially only \"resets\" his current body back to its youthful appearance (the Doctor referring to this as the cycle \"breaking in\"), and the eventual transition to the [[Twelfth Doctor]] happens with a flash and the actor suddenly lurching back, standing back up to reveal the new Doctor.\n\nIn the 2017 Christmas special [[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]], the Twelfth Doctor completes his regeneration into the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] (played by incumbent actress [[Jodie Whittaker]]). The effect used was more akin to the Tenth Doctor's regeneration to the Eleventh, with an explosive energy discharge being released from the Doctor, and steady streams of regeneration energy being emitted from his hands and head before his features were morphed into Whittaker's.\n\n==Characteristics within the series==\n\n===Relationship with the TARDIS===\nIt is mentioned that the TARDIS assists the Doctor during the regenerative process, as suggested by the Second Doctor's statement to this effect shortly after regenerating from the First. This is reiterated by [[Jack Harkness]]' insistence that the Doctor be taken into the TARDIS having been shot by a Dalek in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\". Of the six occasions on which the Doctor has regenerated outside the TARDIS: one is forced on him by the Time Lords (Second to Third Doctor, ''The War Games''); one requires a Time Lord to give the Doctor's cells a \"little push\" to start the process (Third to Fourth, ''Planet of the Spiders''); one results in his being dependent on the TARDIS's \"Zero Room\", a chamber sealed from all outside forces, to help him recover (Fourth to Fifth, ''Castrovalva''); one occurs a few hours after he has actually \"died\" (Seventh to Eighth, the 1996 television film; the delay at is, however, shown to have been caused by anaesthetic, rather than the Doctor's distance from the TARDIS); one is induced by the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] after reviving the Doctor from actual death (Eighth Doctor, \"The Night of the Doctor\"). The Seventh to Eighth regeneration remains the only one that takes place significantly far away from the TARDIS, without any obvious interaction from other Time Lords and results in the Doctor suffering near-complete [[amnesia]] for nearly a day until an event inside the TARDIS triggers his memories to return. The future Eleventh Doctor is killed in mid-regeneration, showing he is vulnerable to death while regenerating and as such his need for the TARDIS may be for safety rather than aid. However it is later revealed that this regeneration was indeed a simulation since the Doctor who was shot was actually a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Teselecta|Teselecta robot]]. The Eleventh Doctor starts his regeneration outside the TARDIS though he does end it inside it. In the case of the [[Twelfth Doctor]], he briefly begins his regeneration after being shot by a laser from a Mondasian [[Cyberman]] away from the TARDIS, but holds it off. When his actual regeneration starts, he emerges from the TARDIS as he struggles to hold it back. When the Twelfth Doctor finally does regenerate, it is within the TARDIS. As the Doctor contemplates his regeneration, the TARDIS appears to make its opinion on the matter known by flashing its lights at the Doctor, eliciting a response from him.\n\n===Energy release and increased strength===\nThe exact mechanism that makes regeneration possible is not stated in the television series, but it is generally assumed in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] that the ability to regenerate may be linked to what is known as the \"[[Rassilon]] Imprimatur\", the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] nuclei of a Time Lord that bonds him or her to a TARDIS, and allows his or her body to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel (''[[The Two Doctors]]'', 1985).<ref group=note>The [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]]-authored book ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (1991 book)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' attributes regeneration to a \"[[nanotechnology|nanomolecular]] virus\" that rebuilds the body. The audio play ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who)|Zagreus]]'' attributes regeneration to \"self-replicating biogenic molecules\" designed by Rassilon, which do much the same thing, with a built-in limit of twelve regenerations to prevent the molecules' decay. According to the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] book ''[[The Crystal Bucephalus]]'' by [[Craig Hinton]], Time Lords have triple-helix [[DNA]]: the third strand was added by Rassilon to make regeneration possible. The novelisation of [[The Twin Dilemma]] by [[Eric Saward]] states that the regenerative process is triggered by a massive release of the hormone ''lindos'', which is transported at great speed around the Time Lord's body, causing its cells to reform and realign. These varying explanations may or may not be compatible with each other, and like all spin-off media, their [[canon (fiction)#Doctor Who|canonicity]] with respect to the television series is unclear.</ref>\n\nIn \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" (2005) it is stated that the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body, and also shown that residual effects from a regeneration allow him to grow back a hand within the first 15 hours after the initial start of the regeneration. Accordingly, in \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", River Song is able to repel bullets after regenerating. She is later able to send off an energy wave soon after her regeneration, though this particular feat may be one of the abilities gained during this time.\n\nIn the series four finale of the revived series, \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", an injured [[Tenth Doctor]] manages to avert a full regeneration by channelling \"excess regenerative energy\" into his severed hand, allowing him to heal without changing form. The limb ends up developing into a half-human clone when Donna Noble touches it; the event, a \"two-way\" \"Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis\", also gives Donna a Time Lord's mind.\n\nIncreased strength is sometimes a temporary by-product of regeneration. Shortly after his third regeneration, the [[Fourth Doctor]] karate-chopped a brick in half in episode one of [[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]], but was unable to repeat the action later in the same serial. In the moments following his regeneration into his [[Eighth Doctor|eighth incarnation]], the Doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a steel door completely off its hinges. In \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\", the [[First Doctor]]'s dying of old age had earlier rendered him \"weak as a kitten\", but his oncoming regeneration temporarily provides him with renewed strength and vitality (as explained to him by the [[Twelfth Doctor]]).\n\nIn \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" when the [[Tenth Doctor]] regenerates into the [[Eleventh Doctor]], the release of energy damages the TARDIS to the extent that components fall, the door's windows smash and the TARDIS then flies uncontrollably over Earth before crash-landing in [[Amy Pond]]'s garden. Later, when the Eleventh Doctor begins his regeneration into the [[Twelfth Doctor]] in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", he is able to control his regeneration energy and sends out energy blasts that obliterate nearby [[Dalek]]s and an entire Dalek saucer. The release of energy also causes a shockwave that severely damages the town where the regeneration took place.\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor's regeneration into the Thirteenth is also quite explosive; while the streams of regeneration energy being emitted from the Doctor cause some minor damage to the console room, the full extent is revealed when it begins to explode immediately after the Doctor attempts to operate it, and she ends up falling from the TARDIS.\n\n===Personality change===\nWith regeneration also comes a change of personality. The viewing audience sees this most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the Doctor's various incarnations. The Doctor's core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained, but in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" the Tenth Doctor laments that demise of his current incarnation, with its own personality and attributes, makes for something much akin to an actual death. His last words before regenerating are \"I don't want to go.\"\n\nShortly after the regeneration process, the Doctor sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability. The Fourth Doctor described it as \"a new body is like a new house - takes a little bit of time to settle in\". The Second Doctor experiences crippling pain after his first regeneration (in ''The Power of the Daleks''), while the Third Doctor collapses outside the TARDIS following his regeneration (in ''Spearhead from Space''). The Fourth Doctor started rambling random phrases and possessed a higher than usual strength; he could cut a brick in half merely with his hand (in ''Robot''). The Fifth Doctor (in ''Castrovalva'') begins reverting to his previous personalities, and the Sixth Doctor experiences extreme [[paranoia]], flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion (''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'', 1984). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia as a result of post-regeneration trauma (the 1996 [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|television film]]); uniquely, the Doctor was \"not alive\" at the time of this regeneration. The regeneration from the Ninth to the Tenth Doctor sees the Doctor experiencing sudden spasms and great pain (\"[[Doctor Who: Children in Need|Children in Need special]]\"), and later being unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (\"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"). The regeneration from the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor caused the Doctor to experience strange food cravings, only to be disgusted by them upon actually trying them (\"The Eleventh Hour\"). The Twelfth Doctor forgot how to fly the TARDIS (as well as the name of the TARDIS) right after the regeneration process in [[The Time of the Doctor]]. ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' implies that Time Lords other than the Doctor may experience difficult regenerations, since the Sisterhood of Karn had been supplying them with an \"[[elixir of life]]\" that could assist the process. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Sisterhood tell the [[Eighth Doctor]] they can provide elixirs to give rise to non-random regenerations, allowing the Doctor to specify either a physical type or personality.\n\nThe Master showed a dramatic personality change upon regenerating into the Mistress/Missy. In that form, she wants nothing more than to renew her bond with the Doctor, even calling him her \"boyfriend\" at one point. (\"Deep Breath, Death in Heaven\") When she met him again, Missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately. (\"Dark Water\") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust. In turn, though Missy expressed a love for who she was in her past incarnation, she forced his own regeneration into her to ensure she would become the person she now was (\"[[The Doctor Falls]]\").\n\n===Extent of physical change===\nThe Doctor has always regenerated into a humanoid form. However, when explaining the process of regeneration to [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] at the end of \"The Parting of the Ways\", the Ninth Doctor suggests that his new form could have \"two heads\", or even \"no head\", and in the 2005 [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|Children in Need special]], which takes place immediately after that episode, the newly regenerated Tenth Doctor, while examining his new body, makes a point of checking that he has two arms, two legs and two hands, implying that regenerations can sometimes result in physically deformed or non-humanoid forms; similarly, the Eleventh Doctor, upon regenerating, shows relief to still have legs and proceeds to check whether he still has fingers and human facial features. It is not clear whether or not these moments are intended as jokes. The beginning of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) featured Romana trying out a number of potential forms, two of which included a blue-skinned pygmy and a giantess.\n\nWhether Time Lords could change gender in regeneration was never addressed onscreen during the classic series and not explicitly focused on for much of the revival. In ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'' (1976), the Kastrian Eldrad compared his transformation from female to male to Time Lord regeneration, possibly suggesting the process could produce a sex change. The concept of Time Lords changing gender upon regeneration was seeded throughout Moffat's tenure as showrunner. In the second part of \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2010), the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) briefly checks for an Adam's apple upon regeneration to confirm if he is still a man. In the 2011 episode \"[[The Doctor's Wife]]\", the Doctor recalls a Time Lord acquaintance known as the Corsair, who had at least two female incarnations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/08/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-doctors-wife|title='Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About 'The Doctor's Wife' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref> In the 2013 short \"[[Night of the Doctor]]\", the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] offer a dying [[Eighth Doctor]] ([[Paul McGann]]) control over his inevitable regeneration, with \"man or woman\" being touted as possibilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/11/doctor-who-making-sense-of-the-night-of-the-doctor|title='Doctor Who': Making Sense of 'The Night of the Doctor' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref> The first on-screen cross-gender regeneration was shown in the 2015 episode \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", in which a white male Gallifreyan general ([[Ken Bones]]) regenerates into a black woman (T'Nia Miller), who states that her previous incarnation was the only time she had been a man.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/dec/05/doctor-who-series-35-episode-12-hell-bent|title=Doctor Who, series 35, episode 12 \u2013 Hell Bent|last=Martin|first=Dan|date=5 December 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe most notable Time Lord to have appeared in both male and female forms prior to Whittaker's casting is the Doctor's nemesis, [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], portrayed from 2014 to 2017 by Scottish actress [[Michelle Gomez]].

From \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" onward, [[Jodie Whittaker]] portrays the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], the Doctor's first female incarnation.\n\nFemale Doctors were previously explored in spin-off productions; [[Joanna Lumley]] appeared as a satirical version of the Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 [[Comic Relief]] special ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death|The Curse of Fatal Death]]''. [[Arabella Weir]] also played an alternate [[Third Doctor]] in the ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] episode ''[[Exile (audio drama)|Exile]]''. Neither portrayal is typically considered to be within the show's main continuity.<ref name=\"Peck 2013\">{{cite web|first1=Matthew Wace|last1=Peck|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/355731|title=Op-Ed: Is the new Doctor Who a woman?|work=Digital Journal|publisher=digitaljournal.com|date=August 3, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> Spin-off media have also depicted more drastic regenerations than the TV series. For example, in the Big Finish Productions audio ''[[Circular Time]]'', a Time Lord known as Cardinal Zero regenerates into an [[Bird|avian]] life-form after being poisoned.<ref>[http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf91.htm \"Circular Time\"], ''Doctor Who Reference Guide''. Retrieved on 11 July 2015.</ref>\n\n===Control over regeneration===\nThe Doctor's regenerations are always involuntary, and he has no control over his final appearance. In \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005), the Ninth Doctor describes the process as \"a bit dodgy\"\u2014i.e., somewhat dangerous or uncertain\u2014and the Tenth Doctor refers to regeneration as \"a lottery\" (\"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", 2013). For example, despite an apparent wish for this to occur, neither the Ninth nor the Tenth Doctors regenerated into [[red hair|redheads]]. The sole known exception to this is the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (\"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", 2013), as the Doctor was able to consume a potion made by the Sisterhood of Karn which ensured his next body was a warrior able to fight in the last Great Time War, though he didn't appear to make any specifications about the actual physical appearance. The Doctor was also once given the chance to choose his appearance upon his forced regeneration by the Time Lords in ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969) but rejected all of the options presented to him. The Time Lords grew tired of his stalling and thus sent him away to regenerate into the [[Third Doctor]], an apparently random result. Alternatively, the Tenth Doctor was shown twice to exert control over regenerating, attributed by the Eleventh Doctor to \"having vanity issues at the time.\" In \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008), after being shot by a Dalek triggered a regeneration, the Tenth Doctor used the regeneration energy to heal his wounds, then channelled the remaining energy into his severed hand and purposely kept his current appearance. When he finally did regenerate into the Eleventh Doctor, he still consciously prevented himself from regenerating to prolong his time as his current incarnation for several hours. Doing this caused a more explosive regeneration that nearly destroyed the TARDIS.\n\nIn contrast, the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) depicts Romana undergoing a voluntary regeneration, in which she tries out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a person she encountered in a previous adventure (''[[The Armageddon Factor]]''). Many writers of spin-off media have attempted to rationalise the difference between the Doctor's and Romana's regenerations. ''Doctor Who'' television writer and script editor [[Eric Saward]] suggests in his 1985 novelisation of ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'' (1984) that Time Lords can control the appearance of their next body if they trigger the regeneration voluntarily, but not if the regeneration is caused by death or injury. [[The Doctor Who Role Playing Game]] by FASA suggests that some Time Lords have a special ability to control their regenerations. The fan reference book ''[[The Discontinuity Guide]]'' suggests that Romana's various \"try-ons\" were projections of potential future incarnations like the K'anpo Rinpoche/Cho Je situation in ''Planet of the Spiders''.<ref name=\"discontinuity\">{{cite book\n | author=Paul Cornell |author2=Martin Day |author3-link=Keith Topping |author3=Keith Topping\n | year = 2004\n | title = The Discontinuity Guide\n | edition = 2nd\n | location = Austin, TX\n | publisher=[[MonkeyBrain Books]]\n | chapter = Destiny of the Daleks\n | chapterurl = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/destinydaleks/detail.shtml\n | format = reprinted on BBC ''Doctor Who'' website\n | accessdate = 21 April 2009\n | isbn = 1-932265-09-0\n | page = 234\n|author2-link=Martin Day |author-link=Paul Cornell |title-link=The Discontinuity Guide }}</ref> Miles and Wood's ''About Time'' also mentions this while theorising that the Time Lords had improved the technology of regeneration since the Doctor's time; Romana, being of a later generation than the Doctor, would therefore have finer control over the regenerative process in its early stages.<ref name=\"about time 4\">{{cite book\n | author=Lawrence Miles\n |author2=Tat Wood \n |date=December 2004\n | title = About Time 4: The Unauthorized Guide to Doctor Who (Seasons 12 to 17)\n | pages = 270\u2013271\n | location = New Orleans\n | publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]]\n | isbn = 0-9759446-3-0\n|author2-link=Tat Wood \n |author-link=Lawrence Miles \n }}</ref>\n\nOther moments in the series suggest that other Time Lords have more control over their regeneration than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), the Master expresses a desire to be \"young and strong\" like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" (2008), the Doctor begins to regenerate in a [[cliffhanger]] moment, but at the start of \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", when Mels begins to regenerate into [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying \"I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can.\" (Even though by ''The Time Of The Doctor'' this was revealed to be a bluff due to the fact that the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" (2017), the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.\n\nIn \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor reveals that there is a period of time, what he calls \"a state of grace,\" when a regenerating Time Lord's current incarnation is restored to full health for a time if the incarnation resists regeneration. During this time, the incarnation must choose whether or not to regenerate. Once the period is over, if the Time Lord chooses not to regenerate, they will permanently die. Furthermore, as time passes during this \"state of grace,\" the Time Lord grows weaker as the period nears its end. The First, Tenth and Twelfth Doctors all used this period of time, though in the case of the Tenth Doctor it was to visit all of his former companions a final time before regenerating rather than out of some form of uncertainty. While in his \"state of grace,\" the First Doctor's face got \"mixed up\" due to his resisting regeneration, an effect not seen with his subsequent incarnations who used the period.\n\n===Recognition of the regenerated===\nThe television series is inconsistent on the question of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in ''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'' (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (though the Doctor takes a while to remember Drax).\n\nThere is also inconsistency as to whether the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in ''The Five Doctors'', the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In ''[[Time Crash]]'', after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a [[predestination paradox]] to cancel out a universe-destroying [[black hole]] with a [[supernova]] by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in ''The Day of the Doctor,'' the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers. When the First Doctor meets the Twelfth Doctor, the First Doctor sees his future self as another Time Lord come to take back his TARDIS and requires convincing as to otherwise.\n\nThe Daleks' ability to recognise the Doctor also varies: they recognise him outright in ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' but need confirmation from other sources in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" and \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\". In \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\", the Daleks' knowledge of the Doctor is tied to a psychic link among them called the path-web, which is hacked to make them forget him. The [[Cybermen]] have their own method of recognising the Doctor, usually through his past incarnations, as seen in ''[[Earthshock]]'' and \"[[The Next Doctor]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", while the Master was under the chameleon arch, the Doctor could not sense that he was a Time Lord. After the Master's personality reasserted itself, the Doctor instantly sensed him and could tell which Time Lord it was without being told. In \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", the Doctor stated that he would be able to recognize the regenerated Master on sight despite having never seen his new incarnation, claiming that Time Lords could always recognize each other. Due to the Master's Archangel Network, the Doctor's ability to sense another Time Lord had been blocked up to that point. During \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", the Master and the Doctor could sense each other's presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out. However, this ability has a limited range as stated by the Doctor to Wilfred Mott. While he could sense that the Master was still on Earth, he could not tell where he was as the Master was too far away to track precisely. In \"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\", The Doctor failed to recognize that Missy was a regeneration of The Master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a Time Lord at all until she revealed her identity to him. In \"[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]\", the disguised Master figured out that Missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from her mannerisms rather than any sort of special ability. In turn, Missy did not realize that the disguised Master was another Time Lord, let alone her own past self until he revealed himself.\n\n===Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle===\nIn ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), it is established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This statement is later repeated in ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|TV film]] and \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Berriman|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/10/26/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|title=Interview: Russell T Davies Talks About THAT Sarah Jane Adventures Line|publisher=SFX.co.uk|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/steven-moffat-on-doctor-numbers-and-the-regeneration-limit|title=Steven Moffat on 'Doctor numbers' and the regeneration limit|author=Darren Scott|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>  In the BBC Series 4 FAQ, writer Russell T Davies made a joke that<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|publisher=BBC|title= Series 4 FAQ}}</ref> suggested that since the Time Lords were believed to be dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: \"Now that his people are gone, who knows?

Davies talks about THAT Sarah Jane Adventures line|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the series has depicted exceptions to this rule in the career of the renegade Time Lord the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]. When the Master finds himself at the end of his regenerative cycle in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981), he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living, although he was using the Source of Traken to bind his mind to the body. In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983), the Master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council of the Time Lords in exchange for his help. In the 1996 television movie, the Master temporarily inhabits the body of a human, and attempts to take the Doctor's remaining regenerations. In \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" (2007), the Master is revealed to have been granted a new body by the Time Lords during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In this new body, the Master appears to have a new regeneration cycle. The Master regenerates in \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007) and \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" (2017) with dialogue in the latter episode suggesting he has at least one more regeneration.\n\nThe number of previous incarnations of the Doctor was at first unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), the Doctor participates in a mental \u2018duel\u2019 with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project the faces of the \"losing\" contestant\u2019s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]] that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=20 August 2013|url=http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Zepo_2.htm|title=The Many Faces of the Doctor: Body Counts and Contextualization in 'The Brain of Morbius'}}</ref> However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries \"How far Doctor? How long have you lived?\", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.<ref>Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012).

Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. {{ISBN|978-193523411-1}}.</ref>\n\nIn other episodes, it was firmly established that the [[William Hartnell]] incarnation of the Doctor was the very first. In ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', the Time Lord President describes the Hartnell incarnation as \"the earliest Doctor\". This is cemented in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' when Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor (introducing himself to the First Doctor) says that he is the fourth regeneration, meaning that there have been five of him. The First Doctor also refers to himself as \"the original\".  Episodes of the revival series showing the lives of the Doctor -- \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Husbands of River Song]]\"\u2014all begin with the William Hartnell incarnation. In \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\", the William Hartnell incarnation is depicted as indeed being the very first incarnation with the First Doctor expressing fear about undergoing his very first regeneration throughout the story.\n\nIn \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", after the Eleventh Doctor shows Craig who he is, he points to his face and says, \"Eleventh\". However, in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", when the Doctor rescues Clara from inside his own time stream, they both see another figure that Clara doesn't recognise. The Doctor then reveals that this is a [[War Doctor|past incarnation]] that he deemed unworthy of the name \"Doctor\" due to the atrocities he committed during the Time War, and only accepted him after learning the truth of how the war ended (\"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\").<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=25 December 2013|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-25/doctor-who-the-time-of-the-doctor-review|title=Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor review'}}</ref> Ultimately, in \"The Time of the Doctor\" the Eleventh Doctor reveals that, counting the War Doctor and the [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]]'s [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|aborted regeneration]], he is actually in his final incarnation, reaching a point where he is dying of old age after centuries of conflict with the Daleks and others on the planet Trenzalore. However, at the behest of Clara, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, allowing a thirteenth regeneration into an incarnation known as the [[Twelfth Doctor]]. The Twelfth Doctor is later able to regenerate into a female incarnation known as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] after suffering fatal injuries during a battle.\n\nIn \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Eleventh Doctor describes his new regeneration ability as the start of a new 'cycle', implying that he's been restored to the customary twelve regenerations. However, in \"[[Kill the Moon]]\", the Twelfth Doctor says he's \"not entirely sure [he] won't keep regenerating forever,\" once again raising the question regarding any limits to this ability. In \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", Rassilon asks the Doctor \"How many regenerations did we grant you?\", and during \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\", two incarnations of the Master express uncertainty about how long it would take them to kill the Doctor, further implying that the Doctor has a finite number of regenerations even as the exact amount remains undetermined.\n\nIn \"[[The Timeless Children]]\", it is revealed that the Doctor is the Timeless Child, a being who predated the Time Lords and who can regenerate an unlimited number of times.\n\n===Temporary potential future incarnations===\nIn some cases, future potential incarnations can achieve independent, though temporary, existence. In ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'', a Time Lord, K'anpo Rinpoche, creates a corporeal projection of a future incarnation which has such an existence under the name Cho Je until he regenerates into that incarnation. The [[Valeyard]], an \"amalgamation of the darker sides of [the Doctor's] nature, somewhere between [his] twelfth and final incarnation\", appears in ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' (1986) opposite the [[Sixth Doctor]]; the Valeyard is promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations. Another example is [[Watcher (Doctor Who)|\"The Watcher\"]], who repeatedly appears to the Fourth Doctor in ''[[Logopolis]]'' (1981), and ultimately merges with him as part of his regeneration into his [[Fifth Doctor|fifth incarnation]].\n\nThe Time Lords' ability to change species during regeneration is referred to in the television movie by the Eighth Doctor in relation to the Master. Mavic Chen states that the First Doctor's resemblance to an Earth creature is \"only a disguise\" in ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' (1965). In ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), the Fourth Doctor's Time Lady companion [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] demonstrates an apparent ability to \"try on\" different bodies from a number of different species during her regeneration, before settling on a final, humanoid form which physically resembles [[The Armageddon Factor|Princess Astra of Atrios]].\n\nSteven Moffat has said that reference will be made to Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the [[Whoniverse]] during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: \"The face is not set from birth. It\u2019s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that\u2019s the case because in ''[[The War Games]]'' he has a choice of faces. So we know it\u2019s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can\u2019t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he\u2019ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?\u201d{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In \"[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]\" (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\" (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision to save the life of Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in \"[[The Fires of Pompeii]]\" (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.\n\n===Regeneration of non-Gallifreyans===\nThe fact that the Master is inhabiting a non-Gallifreyan body when he is offered a new cycle of regenerations (see above) implies that it is possible to grant them to a non-Gallifreyan, albeit one inhabited by a Time Lord mind. In addition, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] is shown to have the ability to regenerate due to altered DNA that has similarities to Time Lord DNA, a side effect  of having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it travelled through the spacetime vortex. Non-Gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in ''[[Underworld (Doctor Who)|Underworld]]'' (1978) and ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), but with adverse side effects. In ''Mawdryn Undead'', these appear to be the result of mishandling stolen technology, but in ''Underworld'' they are implied to be the inevitable result of limited technology that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subject's appearance (in this case, the [[Minyans]], with whom the Time Lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating 'the body, not the soul'.\n\n===Failed/fake regeneration===\nIt has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in ''Planet of the Spiders'', the Third Doctor's regeneration requires \"a little push\" from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in ''The Caves of Androzani'', the Fifth Doctor says, \"I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time... is this death?\" He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under [[anaesthesia]] at the time of his \"death\" could have \"destroyed the regenerative process\", and that he was \"dead too long this time\" prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios \u2013 in \"The End of Time\" \u2013 he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and \"a new man\" walks away). In ''The Mind of Evil'' the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to \"put a bullet through both [his] hearts,\" while in \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] (he drowned without his future companion [[Donna Noble]] there to inspire him to leave), a [[UNIT]] member speculates that the death of the Doctor \"must have happened too fast for him to regenerate\". In \"The End of Time\", the Doctor explains to [[Wilfred Mott]] that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.\n\nIn the Series 6 premiere, \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\", a future version of the [[Eleventh Doctor]] is shot twice by the titular astronaut and begins to regenerate. However he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only can he be killed before regeneration, but also during the process (However, the later revelation, in \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" that what was shot was in fact a mechanical avatar of the Doctor and not the real person calls this into question). In the episode \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", the Doctor is poisoned by [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when River gives up her remaining regenerations to save him. \"The Time of the Doctor\" later shows that the Doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway.\n\nIn the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Eighth Doctor is killed when the ship he is on crashes onto the planet Karn, reinforcing the idea that a sudden, traumatic death may prevent regeneration. The Sisterhood of Karn explain that he was, in fact, dead, but they were able to use their Time Lord-based technology to revive him and force a regeneration anyway.\n\nIn \"[[Heaven Sent (Doctor Who)|Heaven Sent]]\", the Twelfth Doctor is badly burned by the Veil, preventing him from regenerating properly. However, as his island prison resets itself after leaving a room, he used what was left of his life to download a past version of himself out of the teleporter's hard drive, which also reset. This cycle of bringing himself back to life by burning his current body as energy for the process continued for approximately 4.5 billion years, according to the episode \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]].\"\n\nIn \"[[The Lie of the Land (Doctor Who)|The Lie of the Land]]\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration after his companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]] shoots him after he pretends to be siding with the Monks. The bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, and the whole thing was a test by the Doctor to see if Bill was under the Monks' influence.\n\n===Transference of regenerative energy===\nIn ''Mawdryn Undead'', it is first stated that a Time Lord can transfer his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn to give up his future regenerations in order to cure [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Tegan Jovanka]] from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]]), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a Time Lord. It is not until \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\" that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead [[Eleventh Doctor]]. The favour is returned in \"[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]\" in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy despite it later being revealed that the Doctor is out of regenerations at that point.\n\nA major plot point of the 1996 TV movie involves the Master scheming to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations for himself.\n\nThe Tenth Doctor also consciously aborts a regeneration in \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" and instead transfers the energy to his previously severed hand (from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), which had been saved in a container by Captain Jack Harkness; when Donna Noble touches it, it creates an entirely new person - a \"meta-crisis\" half-human Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor confirms, before himself regenerating during the events of \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", that this action used up a full regeneration.\n\nIn \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\", the [[Twelfth Doctor]] offers a small amount of regenerative energy to [[Daleks|Dalek]] creator [[Davros]] to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer. The Doctor says that doing so \"may cost [him] an arm or a leg down the road\". Davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the Doctor to revitalize himself and transform the Daleks on [[Skaro]] into superior hybrid creatures. His plan backfires when decaying Daleks\u2014incapable of dying, and kept in an underground 'sewer' system when their effective 'lives' have expired\u2014are also reenergized and attack the Daleks on the surface. The Doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.\n\n==Regenerations depicted in the series==\n\n===The Doctor's regenerations===\n[[File:10's regeneration.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Tenth Doctor's explosive regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor.]]\n\n# [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]): Weakened by the [[Cyberman|Cybermen's]] draining of Earth's energy in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966). This was briefly stalled in \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n# [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]): Forced to regenerate by the Time Lords as a penalty for repeatedly breaching their law of non-intervention in ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969).\n# [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]): [[Radiation poisoning|Poisoned by radiation]] after battling the Great One on the planet Metebelis III in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974).\n# [[Fourth Doctor]] ([[Tom Baker]]): Fell from the Pharos Project telescope and merged with a mysterious \"in-between\" incarnation named 'The Watcher' in ''[[Logopolis]]'' (1981).\n# [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]): Succumbed to spectrox poisoning, contacted near the start of ''[[The Caves of Androzani]]'' (1984).\n# [[Sixth Doctor]] ([[Colin Baker]]): Severely injured during the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]]'s attack on the TARDIS after it crash-landed on the planet Lakertya in ''[[Time and the Rani]]'' (1987).\n# [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]): Shot by a gang in [[San Francisco]] and passed mid-operation by surgeons unfamiliar with his alien physiology in the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 television film]].\n# [[Eighth Doctor]] ([[Paul McGann]]): Drank a prepared elixir by the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] after fatally crash-landing onto the planet in \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" (2013).\n# [[War Doctor]] ([[John Hurt]]): Perished from old age shortly after the end of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" (2013).\n# [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]): Absorbed the Time Vortex from [[Rose Tyler]] which triggered cellular degeneration in \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005).\n# [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]): Exterminated by a [[Dalek]] in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" (2008). This was aborted by directing regeneration energy into a severed hand to maintain his appearance in \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (2008).<!-- \"The Time of the Doctor\" states clearly that the Tenth Doctor regenerated twice -->\n# Tenth Doctor (David Tennant): Exposed to intense Vinvocci radiation in lieu of [[Wilfred Mott]] in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2009\u20132010).\n# [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]): Granted a new regeneration cycle by the Time Lords at the point of death from old age in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013).\n# [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]): Electrocuted by Mondasian Cybermen in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" (2017). He briefly stalled the process before embracing regeneration in \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\nThe First, War and Eleventh Doctors' bodies died from old age. All other incarnations were killed. In \"[[The Timeless Children]]\" (2020), it is established that the Doctor has infinite regeneration cycles.\n\n===Romana's regenerations===<!-- This section is linked from [[Romana (Doctor Who)]] -->\n[[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]]'s [[tongue-in-cheek]] regeneration scene in ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) contrasts markedly with the Doctor's transformations. In the first episode of the serial, Romana undergoes regeneration, in the process trying out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a character she encountered in a previous adventure (''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'').\n\nMultiple attempts have been made in the spin-off media to explain the necessity for Romana's regeneration.\n* In the short story \"The Lying Old Witch in the Wardrobe\" by [[Mark Michalowski]], published in the [[Big Finish Productions]] anthology, ''[[Short Trips: Companions]]'', unknown to the Doctor, Romana suffers damage due to exposure to [[the Key to Time]]. Just as she is about to regenerate, a humanoid manifestation of the TARDIS, jealous of Romana, traps her in a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]]. It proceeds to pretend to be Romana, changing into different forms until finally becoming a double of Princess Astra. This manifestation is the one who appears in ''Destiny of the Daleks''. Realising the error of its ways after that adventure, it releases Romana, but not before making the female Time Lord assume the image of Astra.\n* The second explanation is given in the [[Gallifrey (audio series)|''Gallifrey'' audio series]]. ''Gallifrey: Lies'' by [[Gary Russell]] reveals that Romana forced her own regeneration to prevent an ancient Gallifreyan evil called Pandora from gaining power over her (see also [[History of the Time Lords#Audio plays|History of the Time Lords \u2013 Audio plays]]).\n* The third explanation is in the [[Fifth Doctor]] audio story ''[[The Chaos Pool]]'' by [[Peter Anghelides]], which states that the creators of the Key to Time re-disguised its final segment as Romana, which is why she changed and why she chose Astra's form.\n\n===The Master's regenerations===\nThe [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] has only been shown to regenerate once onscreen. However, the Master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon Time Lords. Originally played by [[Roger Delgado]], his decrepit later appearance (following Delgado's death) in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976) is explained as owing to the fact that he is in his final regeneration. He is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of Tremas (Antony Ainley) in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981). Ainley portrays the Master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle. In the 1996 [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|TV movie]], the Master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]), giving the Master another new form.\n\nWhen the Master is reintroduced in 2007, exposition explains he was resurrected by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War, apparently with a new regeneration cycle. In \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (2007), he is fatally shot by his assistant and changes from a form known as Professor Yana, played by [[Derek Jacobi]], into a new incarnation, played by [[John Simm]]. Before regenerating, the Master expresses desire to become \"young and strong\" like the [[Tenth Doctor]]. A character named Missy first appears in \"[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]\" (2014) before being revealed as the Master in \"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" (2014), having regenerated off-screen during the character's absence. For most of Missy's appearances, it is unknown how the Master regenerated into her. It is later revealed in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" that it was Missy herself who forced the regeneration. In an effort to ensure that she would come into existence and stand with the Doctor, Missy stabbed the Master in the back to trigger his regeneration, but made the wound \"precise\" so that he would have time to reach his TARDIS before the regeneration began. In return, the Master killed Missy with his laser screwdriver and stated that he'd disabled her regeneration so that she would die permanently of the shot. Though the Master's regeneration into Missy was left inevitable, it was not shown on-screen. However, Missy was unsure if that particular incarnation would regenerate into her directly, being afflicted with memory loss resultant from the crossing of their respective timelines.\n\nIn several of the short stories published in the ''Doctor Who'' universe, some regenerations for the Master are seen including two separate reasons for the Roger Delgado incarnation's regeneration. In the short story ''Pandoric's Box'', the Master is depicted as regenerating into Missy due to his battle with Rassilon who also regenerated as predicted by the Moment. However, this is contradicted by \"[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]\" and \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\".\n\n===River Song's regenerations===\n[[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], also known as Melody Pond has regenerated twice throughout the course of the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]]. Although she is human and the daughter of [[Amy Pond]] (hence her surname) and [[Rory Williams]], she was conceived on their wedding night aboard the [[TARDIS]] and therefore was born with genetic traits similar to the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords.\n\nIn \"[[Day of the Moon]]\" (2011), Melody Pond as a child (Sydney Wade) walks through a New York City alley at the end of the episode in early 1970, suffering from an unknown illness. When a vagrant asks of her condition, she explains that all is well, that she is dying, but she can fix it. She subsequently begins to regenerate in the style of the revived series as the vagrant flees in terror.\n\nIn \"[[Let's Kill Hitler]]\", it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (Maya Glace-Green). This form later matured into Amy Pond's best friend, Mels ([[Nina Toussaint-White]]), who regenerated into her more widely known River Song (Alex Kingston) identity after being shot. In the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, Melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy.  In that same episode, River Song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the Doctor; as Amy put it \"You're safe now. Apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that.\" She was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate. In \"[[The Husbands of River Song]]\", it is revealed that River possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but it is never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part-Time Lord physiology or something she obtained from other means.\n\n===Other regenerations===\n\nIn \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015), while threatened with a gun, the General states to the Doctor that he is currently in his tenth regeneration. The Doctor then shoots him, causing him to regenerate from an old white man into a younger black woman. The General later states that her previous incarnation was her only one as a male.\n\nIn \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), the Doctor's DNA is used to create the titular \"daughter\" [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] ([[Georgia Tennant]]), who displays many but not all Time Lord traits. In the episode's close, she is shot in the chest and appears to die. However, long after the Doctor and his companions have departed, she miraculously resurrects and expels energy from her mouth which, ambiguously enough, both resembles regenerative energy and the energy emitted by a planet-restoring plot device in the same episode. The question as to whether this is a true regeneration is left unanswered, since Jenny does not change her appearance.\n\nIn \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2009/2010), the Master attacks the Lord President [[Rassilon]] with energy bolts, bringing Rassilon to his knees. By the time of his next appearance in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\", Rassilon has regenerated into a much older incarnation. In the short story ''Pandoric's Box'', it is confirmed that the Master's attack prompted this regeneration as predicted by the Moment.\n\nIn the premiere of the 2009 spin-off series ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'', the original K-9 Mark I (Leeson) is reintroduced and destroyed, but subsequently revealed to have been installed with a \"regeneration circuit\". At this point, the traditional K-9 model \"regenerates\" into a more sophisticated-looking CGI model.\n\n=== Visual effects === \n \nEach new regeneration was also radically different from the previous one, even in terms of the visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of ''The Tenth Planet'' and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'', retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.\n\nEach subsequent regeneration was then filmed in a variety of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode. Indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the [[Russell T Davies]] era. Only BBC Wales ''Doctor Who'' attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked. Ever since \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005), every regeneration has been portrayed as a \"golden glow explosion\" (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in \"The Parting of the Ways\" and is milky white in \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\"). Rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying \"I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him\" to the Tenth Doctor immediately after the Ninth Doctor regenerated. Also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, to the point where the most powerful occurrences, seen in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" and \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", were able to destroy the Tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a Dalek ship along with several troops respectively. Each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the Doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed. In smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in wisps of golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others. The subsequent Children in Need Special established that there was residual \"regeneration energy\" in a gaseous state after a transformation that had to be expelled through the mouth. This was seen again in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" \u2014 though the latter narrative never made quite clear that Jenny actually regenerated. The Tenth Doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the Eleventh Doctor. Consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy. Also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and Time Lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion. Directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a Dalek Saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any Dalek troops in the vicinity. The actual regeneration of the Eleventh Doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration. When regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the Doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy.\n\nThis visual standardisation has allowed narratives to play around with regeneration. The mere presence of \"regeneration energy\" can now be used to heighten dramatic tension. This visual short cut, unavailable to production teams in the classic era, has been a particular favourite of [[Steven Moffat]], who used the \"golden glow\" liberally throughout the 2011 series; in fact, unlike in the Russell T Davies era, in which nearly every regeneration had subtle differences, every Moffat era regeneration until \"The Time of the Doctor\" is nearly identical. Several of the 2011 episodes used that VFX in a way that wordlessly suggested regeneration.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n*[[Time Lord#Physical characteristics|Time Lord physical characteristics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://meshyfish.com/~roo/docwho1.html Rassilon, Omega, and that Other guy: Gallifrey Stuff] \u2013 every fact about the Time Lords no matter how apocryphal\n\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n\n[[Category:Time Lords]]\n[[Category:Fictional superhuman features or abilities]]\n[[Category:Reincarnation in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "DoctorWhoEditor2", "label": "safe", "comment": "Incorrect grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who)"}

In 1046 Henry ended the [[History of the papacy (1048\u20131257)|papal schism]], was crowned Emperor by [[Pope Clement II]], freed the [[Holy See|Vatican]] from dependence on the Roman nobility and laid the foundation for its empire-wide authority. In the duchies Henry enforced sovereign royal right of disposition, thereby ensuring tighter control. In [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict from which he emerged victorious. Another sphere of defiance formed in southern Germany from 1052 to 1055.

After having attended the reform sessions of a number of monasteries, Henry summoned his army at [[Stablo]], In July he joined with contingents at Goslar and deployed his entire army at [[Regensburg]]. He set out on 13&nbsp;August and was soon ambushed in the passes of the [[Bohemian Forest]] and forced to retreat with heavy losses at the [[Battle at Br\u016fdek]]. After the release of a large number of Bohemian hostages, including Bretislavs' son, did Henry procure the release of his prisoners and peace was established. Henry retreated hastily, avoided all grand arrayal and concluded the defeat. On his return to Germany, he appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger]] [[bishop of Bamberg]], the future Pope Clement&nbsp;II.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nIn 1040, [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter of Hungary]] was overthrown by [[Samuel Aba of Hungary|Samuel Aba]] and fled to Germany, where Henry welcomed him despite former enmities. Bretislav was now deprived of his former ally, upon which Henry prepared another campaign into Bohemia. On 15 August, almost exactly one year after his last expedition he set out once more, was victorious and signed a peace treaty with Bretislav at Regensburg.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n[[File:Konrad und seine Gemahlin Gisela.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Conrad II and his wife Gisela kneel in front of the ''Majestas Domini'', [[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]], around 1045/46, Madrid, Biblioteca del monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial,]]\nHenry spent Christmas 1041 at [[Strasbourg]], received emissaries from the Duchy of Burgundy, where he travelled at new year and settled administrative and judicial matters. On the road near [[Basel]] he learnt of Hungarian raids into Bavaria and bestowed the duchy to a certain [[Henry VII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry VII]], a relative of the last independent duke. At Cologne, Henry summoned the royal princes, who unanimously declared war on Hungary. After he had sent a wedding delegation to [[Agnes de Poitou]] he set out in September 1042 and successfully subdued the western territories of Hungary. Aba fled to his eastern estates, as Henry installed a cousin as steward, who was however quickly removed after the emperor had left.\n\nAfter Christmas at his chosen imperial residence Goslar, he received foreign guests. Duke Bretislav appeared in person, a [[Kiev]]an marriage embassy was dismissed and the ambassadors of [[Casimir I of Poland]] were rejected as the duke did not show up in person. Henry left for the French border near [[Ivois]], in order to meet King [[Henry I of France]], most likely to discuss the impending marriage to the princess of [[Aquitaine]]. Henry next returned to Hungary and forced Aba to recognize the [[Danube|Danubian]] territories, a former donation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]], ''pro causa amicitiae'' (for friendship's sake). These territories had been ceded to Hungary after Conrad II's defeat of 1030. This border remained in place between Hungary and [[Austria]] until 1920.\n\n===Promotion of Speyer===\n\nGisela, Henry's mother, died in March 1043. She was solemnly buried in Speyer. The king appeared barefoot, in tears and penitent robe at the funeral, his arms crossed, threw himself on the ground in front of the crowd and moved everyone to tears.  With Henry's emulation of Christian humble self-denial, he intended prove his ability to hold pious kingship. Historians refer since to the period of the ''\"Christomimetic royalty\"''. Henry promoted Speyer far more than his father Conrad. Shortly before leaving for Italy, he endowed the church with a magnificently illustrated gospel book, called the ''[[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]]'', also known as the Speyer Gospel.

Henry claimed that Gothelo I's deathbed wish was to bequeath both sons with a share of the estate. Godfrey, who had been a faithful servant of Henry, eventually rose in rebellion. Henry attempted to reconcile the brothers at [[Nijmegen]] but failed. However, Henry considered the ducal fief to be a royal office and insisted on his prerogative when he appointed dignitaries at his discretion.<ref name=\"Boshof2008\"/>\n\nOn 6 July 1044 Henry, accompanied by [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter Orseolo]], entered Hungary at the head of a rather moderate force.

After he had taken a number of castles, lack of supplies forced him to leave. He garrisoned the ducal castles and cities to prevent any incursions and raids by Godfrey and left for Burgundy. Godfrey had stirred up rebellions in Burgundy by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction and the domestic royal faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. Louis [[County of Montb\u00e9liard|Count of Montb\u00e9liard]], challenged and defeated [[Reginald I, Count of Burgundy]].

During the preparations of the jaunt to Hungary where Henry had intended to spend Pentecost with King Peter, a wooden floor collapsed in a residence where [[Bruno, Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg]] was killed. In Hungary, Peter presented Henry with the ''Golden Lance'' and pledged an oath of fealty among his nobles. The crown of Hungary was bestowed on Peter in perpetuity and the kingdoms of Germany and Hungary were at peace. In July, Godfrey surrendered and was imprisoned at [[Giebichenstein]].\n\n===War in Lorraine===\nHenry fell ill at [[Tribur]] in October, as Henry of Bavaria and Otto of Swabia already chose Otto's nephew and successor in the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] of Lorraine as  successor. Henry III recovered, but remained heirless. In early 1046, Henry's old advisor, Eckard of Meissen, died, leaving Meissen to Henry. He bestowed it on [[Wilhelm IV of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde|William]], count of [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHenry then moved to Lower Lorraine, where Gothelo II had just died and [[Dirk IV of Holland]] had seized [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]]. Henry personally led a campaign against Count Dirk and recovered Flushing. He gave it to [[Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht]], and returned to Aachen to celebrate Pentecost and to decide on the fate of Lorraine. Henry restored Godfrey, but transferred the county of Verdun to the bishop of the city, which angered the duke. Henry bestowed the lower duchy to [[Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine]] and  appointed [[Adalbert of Bremen|Adalbert]] [[archbishop of Bremen]].\n\nThe right of a German court to try an Italian bishop was considered very controversial. The problem culminated in the [[Investiture Controversy]] that overshadowed the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry moved on to Saxony and held imperial courts at [[Quedlinburg]], [[Merseburg]] (in June) and Meissen, where he appointed his daughter Beatrice abbess and ended the strife between [[Siemomys\u0142, Duke of Pomerania]] and [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir of Poland]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[Image:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|Henry before [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] in a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Pope Clement II.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Clement II]], illustration in ''The Lives and Times of the Popes'', Chevalier Artaud de Monto]]\nHenry summoned the senior princes of the empire and departed to Italy.

Henry marched to [[Verona]] and [[Pavia]], where he held court and dispensed justice. He moved on to [[Sutri]] and held [[Council of Sutri|a second court]] on 20 December 1046 where he deposed all three papal candidates.

Guaimar had been acclaimed as [[Duke of Apulia and Calabria]] by the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] mercenaries under [[William Iron Arm]] and his brother [[Drogo of Hauteville]].\n\nIn return, Guaimar had recognized the conquests of the Normans and invested William as his vassal with the [[Count|comital]] title. Henry made Drogo, William's successor in Apulia, a direct vassal of the imperial crown. He did likewise to [[Ranulf Drengot]], the count of [[Aversa]], who had been a vassal of Guaimar as Prince of Capua. Thus, Guaimar was deprived of his greatest vassals, his principality split in two, and his greatest enemy reinstated. These decisions  made Henry unpopular among the Lombards and [[Benevento]], although a papal vassal, would not approve of him. The Italian circuit was completed when he arrived at Verona in May 1047.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Henry's appointments===\nUpon his return to Germany, Henry assigned the offices that had been left vacant. He transferred his last personal duchy to [[Welf, Duke of Carinthia|Welf]] duke of Carinthia, made his Italian [[chancellor]] Hunfried [[Bishop of Ravenna]] appointed several other chairs, installed Guido in [[Piacenza]], his chaplain Theodoric in Verdun, the provost Herman of Speyer in [[Strasbourg]] and his German chancellor Theodoric in Constance. The important Lorrainian bishoprics of [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] received respectively [[Adalbero III of Luxembourg|Adalbero]] and [[Eberhard, Archbishop of Trier|Eberhard]], a chaplain.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nHenry was at Metz in July 1047 when a latent insurrection rose in rebellion. Godfrey was now allied with Baldwin of Flanders, his son (the margrave of Antwerp), Dirk of Holland, and [[Herman, Count of Hainaut]]. Henry gathered an army and went north, where he gave Adalbert of Bremen Godfrey's former lands and oversaw the trial by combat of Thietmar, the brother of [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony]], accused of plotting to kill the king. Bernard, an enemy of Adalbert, was now clearly on Henry's bad side. Henry made peace with the new king of Hungary, [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], and moved into the [[Netherlands]]. At Flushing, he was defeated by Dirk. The Hollanders sacked [[Charlemagne]]'s palace at [[Nijmegen]] and burnt Verdun. Godfrey then performed a public penance and assisted in the reconstruction of Verdun.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nThe rebels besieged [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], that was stoutly defended by Bishop [[Wazo]]. Henry gave Upper Lorraine to one [[Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine|Adalbert]] and left. The pope had died in the meantime and Henry chose Poppo of Brixen to succeed him, who adopted the name [[Damasus II]]. Henry gave Bavaria to one [[Cuno, Duke of Bavaria|Cuno]] and, at Ulm in January 1048, Swabia to [[Otto III, Duke of Swabia|Otto of Schweinfurt]], called ''the White''. Henry met Henry of France again, probably at Ivois in October and at Christmas, envoys from Rome came to seek a new pope, Damasus having died. Henry's most enduring papal selection was Bruno of Toul, who took office as [[Leo IX]], under whom the Church would be divided between East and West. Henry's final appointment of this long spate was a successor to Adalbert in Lorraine. For this, he appointed [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine|Gerard of Chatenoy]], a relative of Adalbert and Henry himself.<ref name=\"Jaeger2013\">{{cite book|author=C.

Dirk of Holland was defeated and killed. Adalbert of Bremen managed a peace with Bernard of Saxony and negotiated a treaty with the missionary monarch [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. With the assistance of Sweyn and [[Edward the Confessor]] of England, whose enemies Baldwin had harboured, Baldwin of Flanders was harassed by sea and unable to escape the onslaught of the imperial army. At Cologne, the pope excommunicated Godfrey and Baldwin. The former abandoned his allies and was imprisoned by the emperor again. Baldwin also gave in under Henry's pressure. Finally, the war had ended in the Low Countries and Lorraine.<ref name=wein>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/31120508/Stefan_Weinfurter_Das_Jahrhundert_der_Salier_1024-1125_ |title=  Das Jahrhundert der Salier (1024-1125) | publisher =  Academia  |date=   |author=Stefan Weinfurter  |accessdate= February 16, 2020  }}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n\nIn 1051, Henry undertook a third Hungarian campaign but suffered a major defeat. His troops fled the battlefield over a range of hills still called \"V\u00e9rtes\" (\"Armoured\") because discarded armour has been found there for centuries. In Lower Lorraine  [[Lambert II, Count of Leuven|Lambert, Count of Louvain]], and Richildis, widow of Herman of Mons and new bride of Baldwin of Antwerp, caused trouble. Godfrey was released and given Lower Lorraine, to safeguard the unstable peace attained two years before.\n\nIn 1052, Henry undertook a fourth campaign against Hungary, and besieged [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] without success, as the Hungarians sank his supply ships on the Danube river. Henry was unable to continue his campaign and in fact never tried again. Henry did send a Swabian army to assist Leo in Italy, but he recalled it quickly. At Christmas 1052, Cuno of Bavaria was summoned to Merseburg and deposed by a small council of princes for his conflict with [[Gebhard III, Bishop of Regensburg]]. Cuno revolted.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\n===Final wars in Germany===\nOn 26 June 1053, at Tribur, the young [[Emperor Henry IV|Henry]], born 11 November 1050, was elected king of Germany. Andrew of Hungary almost made peace, but Cuno convinced him otherwise. Henry appointed his young son duke of Bavaria and went to deal with the ongoing insurrection. Henry sent another army to assist Leo in the [[Mezzogiorno]] against the Normans he himself had confirmed in their conquests as his vassal. Leo, without assistance from Guaimar (distanced from Henry since 1047), was defeated at the [[Battle of Civitate]] on 18 June 1053 by [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], Count of Apulia. [[Robert Guiscard]], his younger brother; and Prince [[Richard I of Capua]]. The Swabians were cut to pieces.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nIn 1054, Henry traveled north to deal with the bellicose Casimir of Poland. He transferred [[Silesia]] from Bretislav to Casimir. Bretislaus nevertheless remained loyal to the end. Henry turned westwards and crowned his young son at Aachen on July 17 and then marched into Flanders, as the two Baldwins had rebelled again. John of Arras, who had seized [[Cambrai]] before, had been forced out by Baldwin of Flanders and so turned to the Emperor. In return for inducing [[Liutpert, Bishop of Cambrai]], to give John the castle, John would lead Henry through Flanders. The Flemish campaign was a success, but Liutpert could not be convinced.\n\nBretislav, who had regained Silesia in a short war, died in 1054. The margrave [[Adalbert of Austria]], however, successfully resisted the depredations of Cuno and the raids of the king of Hungary. Henry could thus direct his attention elsewhere than rebellions for once. He returned to Goslar, the city where his son had been born and which he had raised to imperial and ecclesiastic grandeur with his palace and church reforms. He passed Christmas there and appointed [[Pope Victor II|Gebhard of Eichstedt]] as the next holder of the Petrine see, with the name Victor II. He was the last of Henry's four German popes.<ref name=ordn/>\n\n===Preparing Italy and Germany for his death===\n[[File:Reichsapfel Heinrich III.JPG|thumb|Imperial orb from the burial inventory of Henry III]]\n[[File:SargHeinrichDrei.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Henry III in Goslar]]\nIn 1055, Henry turned south, to Italy again, for [[Boniface&nbsp;III of Tuscany]], ever an imperial ally, had died, and his widow, [[Beatrice of Bar]] had married Godfrey of Lorraine (1054). First, however, he gave his old hostage, [[Spytihn\u011bv II of Bohemia|Spitignev]], the son of Bretislaus to the Bohemians as duke. Spitignev did homage and Bohemia remained securely, loyally, and happily within the Imperial fold. By Easter, Henry had arrived in [[Mantua]]. He held several courts, one at [[Roncaglia (Piacenza)|Roncaglia]], where, a century later (1158), [[Frederick Barbarossa]] held a [[Diet of Roncaglia|far more important diet]], sent out his ''[[missi dominici]]'' to establish order. Godfrey, ostensibly the reason for the visit, was not well received by the people and returned to Flanders. Henry met the pope at [[Florence]] and arrested Beatrice for marrying a traitor, and her daughter [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]], later to be such an enemy of Henry's son. The young [[Frederick of Tuscany]], son of Beatrice, refused to come to Florence and died within days.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nHenry returned and at Christmas 1055 he arranged the subsequent marriage of his successor. In [[Zurich]], the heir to the throne, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], was engaged to [[Bertha of Savoy|Bertha]] of Turin of the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP inrichOxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=47\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHenry entered a Germany in turmoil. A staunch ally against Cuno in Bavaria, Gebhard of Regensburg, was implicated in a plot against the king along with Cuno and Welf of Carinthia. Sources diverge here: some claim only that the retainers of the princes plotted the undoing of the king. Whatever the case, it all came to naught, and Cuno died of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and Welf soon following him to the grave. Baldwin of Flanders and Godfrey were at it again, besieging Antwerp, and they were defeated again. Henry's reign was clearly changing in character: old foes were dead or dying and old friends as well.<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHerman of Cologne died. Henry appointed his confessor, [[Anno II, archbishop of Cologne|Anno]], as Herman's successor. Henry of France, so long eyeing Lorraine greedily, met for a third time with the emperor at Ivois in May 1056. The French king, not renowned for his tactical or strategic prowess, but admirable for his personal valour on the field, had a heated debate with the German king and challenged him to single combat. Henry fled at night from this meeting. Once in Germany again, Godfrey made his final peace, and Henry went to the northeast to deal with a Slav uprising after the death of William of Meissen. He fell ill on the way and took to bed. He freed Beatrice and Matilda and had those with him [[designation (monarchy)|swear allegiance]] to the young Henry, whom he commended the pope, present.\n\nOn 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at [[Bodfeld]], the imperial hunting lodge in the [[Harz Mountains]].{{sfn|Whitney|1968|p=31}} His heart was transferred to Goslar and his body to [[Speyer]], to rest next to his father's in the family vault of the [[Speyer Cathedral|cathedral of Speyer]]. Henry had been one of the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors. His authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against in his son, and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party.<ref name=\"Giesebrecht1841\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Giesebrecht|title=Annales Altahenses: eine Quellenschrift zur Geschichte des eilften Jahrhunderts aus Fragmenten und Excerpten hergestellt|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ|year=1841|publisher=Duncker und Humblot|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ/page/n219 125]\u2013}}</ref> He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one point or another but gave them all away.

In 1046 Henry ended the [[History of the papacy (1048\u20131257)|papal schism]], was crowned Emperor by [[Pope Clement II]], freed the [[Holy See|Vatican]] from dependence on the Roman nobility and laid the foundation for its empire-wide authority.

In [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict from which he emerged victorious. Another sphere of defiance formed in southern Germany from 1052 to 1055.

After having attended the reform sessions of a number of monasteries, Henry summoned his army at [[Stablo]], In July he joined with contingents at Goslar and deployed his entire army at [[Regensburg]]. He set out on 13&nbsp;August and was soon ambushed in the passes of the [[Bohemian Forest]] and forced to retreat with heavy losses at the [[Battle at Br\u016fdek]]. After the release of a large number of Bohemian hostages, including Bretislavs' son, did Henry procure the release of his prisoners and peace was established. Henry retreated hastily, avoided all grand arrayal and concluded the defeat. On his return to Germany, he appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger]] [[bishop of Bamberg]], the future Pope Clement&nbsp;II.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nIn 1040, [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter of Hungary]] was overthrown by [[Samuel Aba of Hungary|Samuel Aba]] and fled to Germany, where Henry welcomed him despite former enmities. Bretislav was now deprived of his former ally, upon which Henry prepared another campaign into Bohemia. On 15 August, almost exactly one year after his last expedition he set out once more, was victorious and signed a peace treaty with Bretislav at Regensburg.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n[[File:Konrad und seine Gemahlin Gisela.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Conrad II and his wife Gisela kneel in front of the ''Majestas Domini'', [[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]], around 1045/46, Madrid, Biblioteca del monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial,]]\nHenry spent Christmas 1041 at [[Strasbourg]], received emissaries from the Duchy of Burgundy, where he travelled at new year and settled administrative and judicial matters. On the road near [[Basel]] he learnt of Hungarian raids into Bavaria and bestowed the duchy to a certain [[Henry VII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry VII]], a relative of the last independent duke. At Cologne, Henry summoned the royal princes, who unanimously declared war on Hungary. After he had sent a wedding delegation to [[Agnes de Poitou]] he set out in September 1042 and successfully subdued the western territories of Hungary. Aba fled to his eastern estates, as Henry installed a cousin as steward, who was however quickly removed after the emperor had left.\n\nAfter Christmas at his chosen imperial residence Goslar, he received foreign guests. Duke Bretislav appeared in person, a [[Kiev]]an marriage embassy was dismissed and the ambassadors of [[Casimir I of Poland]] were rejected as the duke did not show up in person. Henry left for the French border near [[Ivois]], in order to meet King [[Henry I of France]], most likely to discuss the impending marriage to the princess of [[Aquitaine]]. Henry next returned to Hungary and forced Aba to recognize the [[Danube|Danubian]] territories, a former donation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]], ''pro causa amicitiae'' (for friendship's sake). These territories had been ceded to Hungary after Conrad II's defeat of 1030. This border remained in place between Hungary and [[Austria]] until 1920.\n\n===Promotion of Speyer===\n\nGisela, Henry's mother, died in March 1043. She was solemnly buried in Speyer. The king appeared barefoot, in tears and penitent robe at the funeral, his arms crossed, threw himself on the ground in front of the crowd and moved everyone to tears.  With Henry's emulation of Christian humble self-denial, he intended prove his ability to hold pious kingship. Historians refer since to the period of the ''\"Christomimetic royalty\"''. Henry promoted Speyer far more than his father Conrad. Shortly before leaving for Italy, he endowed the church with a magnificently illustrated gospel book, called the ''[[Golden Gospels of Henry III|Codex Aureus Escorialensis]]'', also known as the Speyer Gospel. The Dome of Speyer was gradually extended during the following years and a large burial sector was created for future rulers and royal continuity.<ref name=\"Reuter2006\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Reuter|title=Medieval Polities and Modern Mentalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGsN0Xbo-ZoC&pg=PA98|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45954-9|pages=98\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Arnold2014\">{{cite book|author=John H.

In order to diminish their power he appointed the younger son [[Gothelo II, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Gothelo&nbsp;II]] as duke of the Lower duchy instead of [[Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine|Godfrey]], Gothelo I's eldest son who already reigned as duke of Upper Lorraine. Henry claimed that Gothelo I's deathbed wish was to bequeath both sons with a share of the estate. Godfrey, who had been a faithful servant of Henry, eventually rose in rebellion. Henry attempted to reconcile the brothers at [[Nijmegen]] but failed. However, Henry considered the ducal fief to be a royal office and insisted on his prerogative when he appointed dignitaries at his discretion.<ref name=\"Boshof2008\"/>\n\nOn 6 July 1044 Henry, accompanied by [[Peter, King of Hungary|Peter Orseolo]], entered Hungary at the head of a rather moderate force.

He was convicted and lost the duchy of Upper Lorraine and his fief of the county of [[Verdun]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=126}} Godfrey fled and took up arms in revolt. Henry wintered at [[Speyer]] and prepared for the Lorraine campaign of 1045.\n\nIn early 1045, Henry entered Lorraine at the head of an army, besieged and conquered Godfrey's castle of [[Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim|B\u00f6ckelheim]] (near [[Kreuznach]]). After he had taken a number of castles, lack of supplies forced him to leave. He garrisoned the ducal castles and cities to prevent any incursions and raids by Godfrey and left for Burgundy. Godfrey had stirred up rebellions in Burgundy by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction and the domestic royal faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. Louis [[County of Montb\u00e9liard|Count of Montb\u00e9liard]], challenged and defeated [[Reginald I, Count of Burgundy]]. When Henry arrived, Reginald and Gerold [[County of Geneva|Count of Geneva]] paid homage and  Burgundy was subsequently incorporated into the empire.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\">{{cite book|author1=Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller|author2=Stefan Weinfurter|title=Die deutschen Herrscher des Mittelalters: historische Portraits von Heinrich I. bis Maximilian I.

In Goslar he invested [[Otto II, Duke of Swabia|Otto]] with the duchy of Swabia, the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] with the [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] and [[Baldwin VI of Flanders|Baldwin]] with the [[Margraviate of Antwerp]]. During the preparations of the jaunt to Hungary where Henry had intended to spend Pentecost with King Peter, a wooden floor collapsed in a residence where [[Bruno, Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg]] was killed. In Hungary, Peter presented Henry with the ''Golden Lance'' and pledged an oath of fealty among his nobles. The crown of Hungary was bestowed on Peter in perpetuity and the kingdoms of Germany and Hungary were at peace. In July, Godfrey surrendered and was imprisoned at [[Giebichenstein]].\n\n===War in Lorraine===\nHenry fell ill at [[Tribur]] in October, as Henry of Bavaria and Otto of Swabia already chose Otto's nephew and successor in the [[Count palatine]], [[Henry I, Count Palatine|Henry I]] of Lorraine as  successor. Henry III recovered, but remained heirless. In early 1046, Henry's old advisor, Eckard of Meissen, died, leaving Meissen to Henry. He bestowed it on [[Wilhelm IV of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde|William]], count of [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHenry then moved to Lower Lorraine, where Gothelo II had just died and [[Dirk IV of Holland]] had seized [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]]. Henry personally led a campaign against Count Dirk and recovered Flushing. He gave it to [[Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht]], and returned to Aachen to celebrate Pentecost and to decide on the fate of Lorraine. Henry restored Godfrey, but transferred the county of Verdun to the bishop of the city, which angered the duke. Henry bestowed the lower duchy to [[Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine]] and  appointed [[Adalbert of Bremen|Adalbert]] [[archbishop of Bremen]].\n\nThe right of a German court to try an Italian bishop was considered very controversial. The problem culminated in the [[Investiture Controversy]] that overshadowed the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry moved on to Saxony and held imperial courts at [[Quedlinburg]], [[Merseburg]] (in June) and Meissen, where he appointed his daughter Beatrice abbess and ended the strife between [[Siemomys\u0142, Duke of Pomerania]] and [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir of Poland]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[Image:Heinrich III. sieht den neuen Stern \u00fcber der Stadt Tivoli (Tyburtina).jpg|thumb|Henry before [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] in a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Pope Clement II.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Clement II]], illustration in ''The Lives and Times of the Popes'', Chevalier Artaud de Monto]]\nHenry summoned the senior princes of the empire and departed to Italy. His ally, Aribert of Milan, had recently died and the Milanese citizens had chosen [[Guido, Archbishop of Milan|Guido]] to succeed him. In Rome, the three popes [[Benedict IX]], [[Sylvester III]], and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory VI]] contested the pontifical honours.\n\nBenedict was a [[Tusculum|Tusculan]] who had previously renounced the throne, Sylvester a [[Crescentii|Crescentian]], and Gregory was a reformer ([[Simony|simoniac]]). Henry marched to [[Verona]] and [[Pavia]], where he held court and dispensed justice. He moved on to [[Sutri]] and held [[Council of Sutri|a second court]] on 20 December 1046 where he deposed all three papal candidates. In Rome he held a synod, declared all Roman priests unfit for office and as Adalbert of Bremen refused the honour, Henry appointed [[Pope Clement II|Suidger of Bamberg]], who was acclaimed by the people and clergy. He adopted the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].<ref name=\"Stroll2011\">{{cite book|author=Mary Stroll|title=Popes and Antipopes: The Politics of Eleventh Century Church Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhLKFV63fYwC&pg=PA10|date=9 December 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-21701-0|pages=10\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ThorndikeShotwell1928\">{{cite book|author1=Lynn Thorndike|author2=James Thomson Shotwell|title=The History of Medieval Europe p.285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyfGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|year=1928|publisher=Dalcassian Publishing Company|pages=285\u2013|id=GGKEY:TY4HYGTG9WL}}</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Day 1046, Clement was consecrated, and Henry and Agnes crowned emperor and empress. The Roman citizen awarded Henry the ''Golden Chain of the Patriciate'' and elvated him to ''[[Patrikios|patricius]]''. Henry visited [[Frascati]], the capital of the [[counts of Tusculum]] and seized all castles of the Crescentii family. Joined by the pope he ventured to southern Italy and reverted most of his fathers policies.<ref name=ordn>{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/vuf/article/view/17742 |title=Ordnungskonfigurationen im Konflikt Das Beispiel Kaiser Heinrichs III. |publisher=  Uni Heidelberg  |author=Stefan Weinfurter |date=  |accessdate=February 16, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAt [[Capua]], Henry was received by Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] and [[Prince of Capua|Capua]]. However, Henry returned Capua to the twice-deprived Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf IV]], a highly unpopular choice. Guaimar had been acclaimed as [[Duke of Apulia and Calabria]] by the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] mercenaries under [[William Iron Arm]] and his brother [[Drogo of Hauteville]].\n\nIn return, Guaimar had recognized the conquests of the Normans and invested William as his vassal with the [[Count|comital]] title. Henry made Drogo, William's successor in Apulia, a direct vassal of the imperial crown. He did likewise to [[Ranulf Drengot]], the count of [[Aversa]], who had been a vassal of Guaimar as Prince of Capua. Thus, Guaimar was deprived of his greatest vassals, his principality split in two, and his greatest enemy reinstated. These decisions  made Henry unpopular among the Lombards and [[Benevento]], although a papal vassal, would not approve of him. The Italian circuit was completed when he arrived at Verona in May 1047.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Henry's appointments===\nUpon his return to Germany, Henry assigned the offices that had been left vacant. He transferred his last personal duchy to [[Welf, Duke of Carinthia|Welf]] duke of Carinthia, made his Italian [[chancellor]] Hunfried [[Bishop of Ravenna]] appointed several other chairs, installed Guido in [[Piacenza]], his chaplain Theodoric in Verdun, the provost Herman of Speyer in [[Strasbourg]] and his German chancellor Theodoric in Constance. The important Lorrainian bishoprics of [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] received respectively [[Adalbero III of Luxembourg|Adalbero]] and [[Eberhard, Archbishop of Trier|Eberhard]], a chaplain.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nHenry was at Metz in July 1047 when a latent insurrection rose in rebellion. Godfrey was now allied with Baldwin of Flanders, his son (the margrave of Antwerp), Dirk of Holland, and [[Herman, Count of Hainaut]]. Henry gathered an army and went north, where he gave Adalbert of Bremen Godfrey's former lands and oversaw the trial by combat of Thietmar, the brother of [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony]], accused of plotting to kill the king. Bernard, an enemy of Adalbert, was now clearly on Henry's bad side. Henry made peace with the new king of Hungary, [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], and moved into the [[Netherlands]]. At Flushing, he was defeated by Dirk. The Hollanders sacked [[Charlemagne]]'s palace at [[Nijmegen]] and burnt Verdun. Godfrey then performed a public penance and assisted in the reconstruction of Verdun.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\nThe rebels besieged [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], that was stoutly defended by Bishop [[Wazo]]. Henry gave Upper Lorraine to one [[Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine|Adalbert]] and left. The pope had died in the meantime and Henry chose Poppo of Brixen to succeed him, who adopted the name [[Damasus II]]. Henry gave Bavaria to one [[Cuno, Duke of Bavaria|Cuno]] and, at Ulm in January 1048, Swabia to [[Otto III, Duke of Swabia|Otto of Schweinfurt]], called ''the White''. Henry met Henry of France again, probably at Ivois in October and at Christmas, envoys from Rome came to seek a new pope, Damasus having died. Henry's most enduring papal selection was Bruno of Toul, who took office as [[Leo IX]], under whom the Church would be divided between East and West. Henry's final appointment of this long spate was a successor to Adalbert in Lorraine. For this, he appointed [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine|Gerard of Chatenoy]], a relative of Adalbert and Henry himself.<ref name=\"Jaeger2013\">{{cite book|author=C.

Dirk of Holland was defeated and killed. Adalbert of Bremen managed a peace with Bernard of Saxony and negotiated a treaty with the missionary monarch [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. With the assistance of Sweyn and [[Edward the Confessor]] of England, whose enemies Baldwin had harboured, Baldwin of Flanders was harassed by sea and unable to escape the onslaught of the imperial army. At Cologne, the pope excommunicated Godfrey and Baldwin. The former abandoned his allies and was imprisoned by the emperor again. Baldwin also gave in under Henry's pressure. Finally, the war had ended in the Low Countries and Lorraine.<ref name=wein>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/31120508/Stefan_Weinfurter_Das_Jahrhundert_der_Salier_1024-1125_ |title=  Das Jahrhundert der Salier (1024-1125) | publisher =  Academia  |date=   |author=Stefan Weinfurter  |accessdate= February 16, 2020  }}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n\nIn 1051, Henry undertook a third Hungarian campaign but suffered a major defeat. His troops fled the battlefield over a range of hills still called \"V\u00e9rtes\" (\"Armoured\") because discarded armour has been found there for centuries. In Lower Lorraine  [[Lambert II, Count of Leuven|Lambert, Count of Louvain]], and Richildis, widow of Herman of Mons and new bride of Baldwin of Antwerp, caused trouble. Godfrey was released and given Lower Lorraine, to safeguard the unstable peace attained two years before.\n\nIn 1052, Henry undertook a fourth campaign against Hungary, and besieged [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] without success, as the Hungarians sank his supply ships on the Danube river. Henry was unable to continue his campaign and in fact never tried again. Henry did send a Swabian army to assist Leo in Italy, but he recalled it quickly. At Christmas 1052, Cuno of Bavaria was summoned to Merseburg and deposed by a small council of princes for his conflict with [[Gebhard III, Bishop of Regensburg]]. Cuno revolted.<ref name=\"Steinhoff1865\"/>\n\n===Final wars in Germany===\nOn 26 June 1053, at Tribur, the young [[Emperor Henry IV|Henry]], born 11 November 1050, was elected king of Germany. Andrew of Hungary almost made peace, but Cuno convinced him otherwise. Henry appointed his young son duke of Bavaria and went to deal with the ongoing insurrection. Henry sent another army to assist Leo in the [[Mezzogiorno]] against the Normans he himself had confirmed in their conquests as his vassal. Leo, without assistance from Guaimar (distanced from Henry since 1047), was defeated at the [[Battle of Civitate]] on 18 June 1053 by [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], Count of Apulia. [[Robert Guiscard]], his younger brother; and Prince [[Richard I of Capua]]. The Swabians were cut to pieces.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nIn 1054, Henry traveled north to deal with the bellicose Casimir of Poland. He transferred [[Silesia]] from Bretislav to Casimir. Bretislaus nevertheless remained loyal to the end. Henry turned westwards and crowned his young son at Aachen on July 17 and then marched into Flanders, as the two Baldwins had rebelled again. John of Arras, who had seized [[Cambrai]] before, had been forced out by Baldwin of Flanders and so turned to the Emperor. In return for inducing [[Liutpert, Bishop of Cambrai]], to give John the castle, John would lead Henry through Flanders. The Flemish campaign was a success, but Liutpert could not be convinced.\n\nBretislav, who had regained Silesia in a short war, died in 1054. The margrave [[Adalbert of Austria]], however, successfully resisted the depredations of Cuno and the raids of the king of Hungary. Henry could thus direct his attention elsewhere than rebellions for once. He returned to Goslar, the city where his son had been born and which he had raised to imperial and ecclesiastic grandeur with his palace and church reforms. He passed Christmas there and appointed [[Pope Victor II|Gebhard of Eichstedt]] as the next holder of the Petrine see, with the name Victor II. He was the last of Henry's four German popes.<ref name=ordn/>\n\n===Preparing Italy and Germany for his death===\n[[File:Reichsapfel Heinrich III.JPG|thumb|Imperial orb from the burial inventory of Henry III]]\n[[File:SargHeinrichDrei.jpg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Henry III in Goslar]]\nIn 1055, Henry turned south, to Italy again, for [[Boniface&nbsp;III of Tuscany]], ever an imperial ally, had died, and his widow, [[Beatrice of Bar]] had married Godfrey of Lorraine (1054). First, however, he gave his old hostage, [[Spytihn\u011bv II of Bohemia|Spitignev]], the son of Bretislaus to the Bohemians as duke. Spitignev did homage and Bohemia remained securely, loyally, and happily within the Imperial fold. By Easter, Henry had arrived in [[Mantua]]. He held several courts, one at [[Roncaglia (Piacenza)|Roncaglia]], where, a century later (1158), [[Frederick Barbarossa]] held a [[Diet of Roncaglia|far more important diet]], sent out his ''[[missi dominici]]'' to establish order. Godfrey, ostensibly the reason for the visit, was not well received by the people and returned to Flanders. Henry met the pope at [[Florence]] and arrested Beatrice for marrying a traitor, and her daughter [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]], later to be such an enemy of Henry's son. The young [[Frederick of Tuscany]], son of Beatrice, refused to come to Florence and died within days.<ref name=\"Schneidm\u00fcllerWeinfurter2003\"/>\n\nHenry returned and at Christmas 1055 he arranged the subsequent marriage of his successor. In [[Zurich]], the heir to the throne, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], was engaged to [[Bertha of Savoy|Bertha]] of Turin of the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Houts2019\">{{cite book|author=Elisabeth van Houts|title=Married Life in the Middle Ages, 900-1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT296|date=31 January 2019|publisher=OUP inrichOxford|isbn=978-0-19-251974-0|pages=47\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHenry entered a Germany in turmoil. A staunch ally against Cuno in Bavaria, Gebhard of Regensburg, was implicated in a plot against the king along with Cuno and Welf of Carinthia. Sources diverge here: some claim only that the retainers of the princes plotted the undoing of the king. Whatever the case, it all came to naught, and Cuno died of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and Welf soon following him to the grave. Baldwin of Flanders and Godfrey were at it again, besieging Antwerp, and they were defeated again. Henry's reign was clearly changing in character: old foes were dead or dying and old friends as well.<ref name=ordn/>\n\nHerman of Cologne died. Henry appointed his confessor, [[Anno II, archbishop of Cologne|Anno]], as Herman's successor. Henry of France, so long eyeing Lorraine greedily, met for a third time with the emperor at Ivois in May 1056. The French king, not renowned for his tactical or strategic prowess, but admirable for his personal valour on the field, had a heated debate with the German king and challenged him to single combat. Henry fled at night from this meeting. Once in Germany again, Godfrey made his final peace, and Henry went to the northeast to deal with a Slav uprising after the death of William of Meissen. He fell ill on the way and took to bed. He freed Beatrice and Matilda and had those with him [[designation (monarchy)|swear allegiance]] to the young Henry, whom he commended the pope, present.\n\nOn 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at [[Bodfeld]], the imperial hunting lodge in the [[Harz Mountains]].{{sfn|Whitney|1968|p=31}} His heart was transferred to Goslar and his body to [[Speyer]], to rest next to his father's in the family vault of the [[Speyer Cathedral|cathedral of Speyer]]. Henry had been one of the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors. His authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against in his son, and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party.<ref name=\"Giesebrecht1841\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Giesebrecht|title=Annales Altahenses: eine Quellenschrift zur Geschichte des eilften Jahrhunderts aus Fragmenten und Excerpten hergestellt|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ|year=1841|publisher=Duncker und Humblot|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_fv1BAAAAYAAJ/page/n219 125]\u2013}}</ref> He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one point or another but gave them all away.
