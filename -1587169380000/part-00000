{"title_page": "Cannabis and impaired driving", "text_new": "\n\nTwo main questions arise in the law surrounding driving after having ingested cannabis: (1) whether cannabis actually impairs driving ability, and (2) whether the common practice of testing for [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] (the main psychoactive substance in cannabis) is a reliable means to measure impairment.

Several recent, extensive studies\u2013including one conducted by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] and one conducted by the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA)\u2013show that drivers with detectable THC in their blood are no more likely to cause car crashes than drivers with no amount of THC in their blood.<ref>Eric M.

On the first question, studies are mixed. Several recent, extensive studies--including one conducted by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] and one conducted by the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA)--show that drivers with detectable THC in their blood are no more likely to cause car crashes than drivers with no amount of THC in their blood.<ref>Eric M.

He is a literary, film, and cultural critic and a novelist and poet, who has also written about gay rights, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nBawer's writings on [[literature]], gay issues and [[Islam]] have all been highly controversial. While championing such authors as [[William Keepers Maxwell Jr.]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], and [[Guy Davenport]], he has criticized such authors as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[E. L. Doctorow]]. A member of the [[New Formalism|New Formalists]], a group of poets who promoted the use of traditional forms, he has assailed such poets as [[Allen Ginsberg]] for what he views as their lack of polish and technique.\n\nBawer was one of the first gay activists to seriously propose [[same-sex marriage]], especially in his book ''A Place at the Table'' (1993). ''While Europe Slept'' (2006) was one of the first to skeptically examine the rise of Islam in the [[Western world]].  \n\nAlthough he has frequently been described as a conservative, Bawer has often protested that such labels are misleading or meaningless. He has explained his views as follows: \"Read ''A Place at the Table'' and ''Stealing Jesus'' and ''While Europe Slept'' and ''Surrender'' one after the other and you will see that all four books are motivated by a dedication to individual identity and individual freedom and an opposition to groupthink, oppression, tyranny.\"<ref name=bruce>{{cite web|title=Who am I|url=http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm|publisher=Bruce Bawer|accessdate=27 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818001723/http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm|archivedate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThrough his father, Bawer is of [[Polish people|Polish]] descent, and through his mother, whom he profiled in the September 2017 issue of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'',<ref>https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/girl-loved-hollywood/</ref> his ancestry is [[English people|English]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], and [[French people|French]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818001723/http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm |archivedate=2013-08-18 }}</ref> In February 2018, he wrote that, according to recent research on his mother's side he was also part Dutch, Italian, and Native American ([[Nansemond]]).<ref>https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/269200/im-not-100-white-honest-injun-bruce-bawer</ref>\n\n[[File:Stony Brook University Arena.jpg|thumb|The Stony Brook University Arena at Stony Brook University]]\nBorn and raised in New York City, Bawer attended New York City public schools and [[Stony Brook University]], where he studied literature under the poet [[Louis Simpson]],<ref name=NTF>{{cite web|title=The Authors|url=http://newthreatstofreedom.com/authors/|publisher=New Threats of Freedom|accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref> among others.

who has been a resident of [[Norway]] since 1999. He is a literary, film, and cultural critic and a novelist and poet, who has also written about gay rights, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nBawer's writings on [[literature]], gay issues and [[Islam]] have all been highly controversial. While championing such authors as [[William Keepers Maxwell Jr.]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], and [[Guy Davenport]], he has criticized such authors as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[E. L. Doctorow]]. A member of the [[New Formalism|New Formalists]], a group of poets who promoted the use of traditional forms, he has assailed such poets as [[Allen Ginsberg]] for what he views as their lack of polish and technique.\n\nBawer was one of the first gay activists to seriously propose [[same-sex marriage]], especially in his book ''A Place at the Table'' (1993). ''While Europe Slept'' (2006) was one of the first to skeptically examine the rise of Islam in the [[Western world]].  \n\nAlthough he has frequently been described as a conservative, Bawer has often protested that such labels are misleading or meaningless. He has explained his views as follows: \"Read ''A Place at the Table'' and ''Stealing Jesus'' and ''While Europe Slept'' and ''Surrender'' one after the other and you will see that all four books are motivated by a dedication to individual identity and individual freedom and an opposition to groupthink, oppression, tyranny.\"<ref name=bruce>{{cite web|title=Who am I|url=http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm|publisher=Bruce Bawer|accessdate=27 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818001723/http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm|archivedate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThrough his father, Bawer is of [[Polish people|Polish]] descent, and through his mother, whom he profiled in the September 2017 issue of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'',<ref>https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/girl-loved-hollywood/</ref> his ancestry is [[English people|English]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], and [[French people|French]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818001723/http://www.brucebawer.com/biog.htm |archivedate=2013-08-18 }}</ref> In February 2018, he wrote that, according to recent research on his mother's side he was also part Dutch, Italian, and Native American ([[Nansemond]]).<ref>https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/269200/im-not-100-white-honest-injun-bruce-bawer</ref>\n\n[[File:Stony Brook University Arena.jpg|thumb|The Stony Brook University Arena at Stony Brook University]]\nBorn and raised in New York City, Bawer attended New York City public schools and [[Stony Brook University]], where he studied literature under the poet [[Louis Simpson]],<ref name=NTF>{{cite web|title=The Authors|url=http://newthreatstofreedom.com/authors/|publisher=New Threats of Freedom|accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref> among others.

He served as an editor of the short-lived magazine ''Arrival'', based in [[California]], in 1987\u201388, was a member of the board of the [[National Book Critics Circle]], and editor of the ''NBCC Journal'' in 1989\u201390.\n\nBawer spent two years (1991\u201393) as University Preceptor at [[Adelphi University]]. In recent years, he has written considerably less literary criticism than he did in the 1980s. Much of it has appeared in ''[[The Hudson Review]]''.\n\n===Early books===\n\nIn 1987, his book ''The Contemporary Stylist'' was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. The year after, Graywolf Press issued Diminishing Fictions, a collection of essays on the modern novel.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the [[Bunyaviridae]] (especially [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever virus]]), [[Ebola]]virus, many of the [[Flaviviridae]] (especially [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Machupo virus]], [[Marburg virus]], Variola virus, and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever virus]].

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

[[Biological agent|Biological weapon]]s (often termed \"bio-weapons\", \"biological threat agents\", or \"bio-agents\") are living [[organism]]s or replicating entities ([[virus]]es, which are not universally considered \"alive\"). [[Entomological warfare|Entomological (insect) warfare]] is a subtype of BW. \n\nBiological warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]], [[chemical warfare]] and [[radiological warfare]], which together with biological warfare make up [[CBRN defense|CBRN]] , the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs). None of these are considered [[conventional weapons]], which are deployed primarily for their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential.\n\nBiological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some [[chemical weapon]]s, biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapon]]s. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups.

The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants).

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).
