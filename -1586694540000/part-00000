Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />\n\nLalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site near the border. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go, but asks for $100,000, to which Lalo agrees. Kim begs Jimmy not to go, saying he is an attorney and not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but he says he will do it because it will be an easy job and no one will suspect him of being the courier.\n\nThe next morning, The Cousins deliver two bags of money to Jimmy at the pickup site and immediately depart. Shortly after Jimmy starts his return trip, a vehicle begins following him and several others cut him off. Numerous gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill Jimmy. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.\n\nThe shooter is Mike, whose truck was also disabled in the shootout. He places the money back in Jimmy's car, and he and Jimmy begin driving back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car soon breaks down, stranding them in the desert. With no vehicle and no cell phone service, their only alternative is to remove the money, push the car over the edge of the road, and begin walking cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows some details of his work for Lalo, and Mike tells Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.\n\nWhen Jimmy fails to return, a stressed Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney and asks him for Jimmy's location. Lalo refuses, telling her Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.\n\nA dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike fails to inspire him. Mike spots the surviving gunman, who is still searching for them. Rather than hide as Mike intends, Jimmy regains his motivation, and runs to the road to attract the gunman's attention. When he is close enough, Mike shoots, causing his vehicle to flip, destroying it and killing him. Mike and Jimmy resume walking, this time on the road.\n\n== Production ==\n\"Bagman\" was directed by series co-creator [[Vince Gilligan]], who considered the episode one of the most challenging episodes he had to direct in his career.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Co-Creator Vince Gilligan on Directing the Most Challenging Episode of His Career |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=April 6, 2020 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407032114/https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-vince-gilligan-recap-episode-8-1234572360/ |archive-date=April 7, 2020 |access-date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Gilligan had been able to make arrangements to direct one episode in the fifth season after completing filming of ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]''.

Josh attended [[Sandy Spring Friends School]] and learned from his headmaster in the 7th grade how to play guitar. He quit the school's Community House program in the 9th grade and finished the year at [[Hammond High School (Columbia, Maryland)|Hammond High School]]. He briefly returned before dropping out of high school altogether. At the age of 16, Joplin successfully passed the [[General Educational Development|GED]] and earned his Maryland high school diploma. \n\nInspired very much by [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s travelogue, [[Blue Highways]] and [[Woody Guthrie]]'s, [[Bound for Glory (book)|Bound for Glory]] Josh picked up his guitar and left home in a 1976 VW Camper Van and spent two years on and off the road, before settling in Denver. His first professional job in music was as the runner for folk/blues legend, [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s concert at [[Swallow Hill Music Association]] [https://swallowhillmusic.org]. They hired him later the same year to open for [[Bill Staines]].  \n\nHis interest in folk music began in earnest after hearing [[Bob Dylan]]'s, [[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']] , and [[Phil Ochs]]' [[Phil Ochs discography|Live At Carnegie Hall]].

[[Geoffrey Himes]] gave Joplin his very first notice, in the Columbia Flier, in 1990. \n\n=== Move to Atlanta ===\nHaving stayed a short time in New York City, Joplin heard [[Kevn Kinney]] on [[WFUV]] and bought his record, MacDougal Blues. This convinced him to relocate to Atlanta. He played mostly solo shows for tips at Sylvia's Atomic Cafe, a [[Candler Park]] neighborhood landmark.

In 1995, Geoff Melkonian (bass/viola/vocals, and Jason Buecker drums/vocals) founded the [[Josh Joplin Group|Josh Joplin Band]].

Josh Joplin Group disbanded in December 2003.\n\nIn 2004, after being inspired by his then-neighbor [[Dan Zanes]], Joplin began recording a solo record with the friends he grew up with as well as the math teacher who originally taught him guitar. On August 23, 2005, he released \"[[Jaywalker (album)|Jaywalker]]\" on [[Eleven Thirty Records]].\n\nIn 2008, Joplin formed a new band with [[Garrison Starr]] called Among The Oak & Ash.

Josh attended [[Sandy Spring Friends School]] and learned from his headmaster in the 7th grade how to play guitar. He quit the school's Community House program in the 9th grade and finished the year at [[Hammond High School (Columbia, Maryland)|Hammond High School]]. He briefly returned before dropping out of high school altogether. At the age of 16, Joplin successfully passed the [[General Educational Development|GED]] and earned his Maryland high school diploma. \n\nInspired very much by [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s travelogue, [[Blue Highways]] and [[Woody Guthrie]]'s, [[Bound for Glory (book)|Bound for Glory]] Josh picked up his guitar and left home in a 1976 VW Camper Van and spent two years on and off the road, before settling in Denver. His first professional job in music was as the runner for folk/blues legend, [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s concert at [[Swallow Hill Music Association]] [https://swallowhillmusic.org]. They hired him later the same year to open for [[Bill Staines]].  \n\nHis interest in folk music began in earnest after hearing [[Bob Dylan]]'s, [[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']] , and [[Phil Ochs]]' [[Phil Ochs discography|Live At Carnegie Hall]].

[[Geoffrey Himes]] gave Joplin his very first notice, in the Columbia Flier, in 1990. \n\n=== Move to Atlanta ===\nHaving stayed a short time in New York City, Joplin heard [[Kevn Kinney]] on [[WFUV]] and bought his record, MacDougal Blues. This convinced him to relocate to Atlanta. He played mostly solo shows for tips at Sylvia's Atomic Cafe, a [[Candler Park]] neighborhood landmark.

For his 12th birthday, his parents allowed him to buy a guitar, which was a [[Gibson ES-140]] 3/4.<ref name=\"Niles\">{{cite book|last1=Niles|first1=Richard|title=The Pat Metheny Interviews: The Inner Workings of His Creativity Revealed|date=2009|publisher=Hal Leonard Books|location=Milwaukee, WI |isbn=978-1-4234-7469-2|pages=4\u201323}}</ref>\n\nMetheny's life changed after hearing the album ''[[Four & More]]'' by [[Miles Davis]]. Soon after, he was captivated by [[Wes Montgomery]]'s album ''[[Smokin' at the Half Note]]'' which was released in 1965. He cites the Beatles, Miles Davis, and Wes Montgomery as having the biggest impact on his music.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nWhen he was 15, he won a scholarship from ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine to a one-week jazz camp where he was mentored by guitarist [[Attila Zoller]], who then invited Metheny to New York City to see guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] and bassist [[Ron Carter]].<ref name=\"Taylor1999\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Taylor |first=B.

After less than a week at college, Metheny realized that playing guitar all day during his teens had left him unprepared for classes. He admitted this to Lee, who offered him a job to teach instead, as the school had recently introduced electric guitar as a course of study.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nHe moved to Boston to teach at the [[Berklee College of Music]] with jazz vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]]<ref name=\"Taylor1999\" /> and established a reputation as a prodigy.<ref name=\"Chinen2010\">{{cite web| last1=Chinen| first1=Nate| title=19th-Century Concept, With a Few Upgrades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/arts/music/31metheny.html|website=New York Times| accessdate=5 April 2010|date=28 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Debut album===\nIn 1974 he appeared on an album unofficially titled ''[[Jaco (album)|Jaco]]'' with pianist [[Paul Bley]], bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]], and drummer [[Bruce Ditmas]] for Carol Goss's [[Improvising Artists]] label. But he was unaware that he was being recorded. During the next year, he joined Gary Burton's band with guitarist [[Mick Goodrick]].\n\nMetheny released his debut album, ''[[Bright Size Life]]'' ([[ECM Records|ECM]], 1976) with [[Jaco Pastorius]] on bass guitar and [[Rakalam Bob Moses|Bob Moses]] on drums. His next album, ''[[Watercolors (Pat Metheny album)|Watercolors]]'' (ECM, 1977), was the first time he recorded with pianist [[Lyle Mays]], who became his most frequent collaborator. The album also featured [[Danny Gottlieb]], who became the drummer for the first version of the [[Pat Metheny Group]].<ref name=\"Ginell\">{{cite web| last1=Ginell| first1=Richard| title=Watercolors|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/watercolors-mw0000649643| website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> With Metheny, Mays, and Gottlieb, the fourth member was bassist [[Mark Egan]] when the album ''[[Pat Metheny Group (album)|Pat Metheny Group]]'' (ECM, 1978) was released.\n\n==Pat Metheny Group==\n{{Main|Pat Metheny Group}}\n[[Image:Steve Rodby and Pat Metheny.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Steve Rodby]] and Pat Metheny]]\nWhen ''[[Pat Metheny Group (album)|Pat Metheny Group]]'' (ECM, 1978) was released, the Group was a quartet comprising, besides Metheny, [[Danny Gottlieb]] on drums, [[Mark Egan]] on bass, and [[Lyle Mays]] on piano, [[autoharp]] and synthesizer. All but Egan had played on Metheny's album [[Watercolors (Pat Metheny album)|Watercolors]] (ECM, 1977), recorded a year before the first Group album.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nThe second Group album, ''[[American Garage]]'' (ECM, 1979), reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Jazz chart and crossed over onto the pop charts. From 1982 to 1985, the Pat Metheny Group released ''[[Offramp (album)|Offramp]]'' (ECM, 1982), a live album, ''[[Travels (Pat Metheny Group album)|Travels]]'' (ECM, 1983), ''[[First Circle (album)|First Circle]]'' (ECM, 1984), and ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman (album)|The Falcon and the Snowman]]'' (EMI, 1985), a soundtrack album for the movie of the same name in which they collaborated on the single \"[[This Is Not America]]\" with [[David Bowie]]. The song reached number 14 in the British Top 40 in 1985 and number 32 in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/01/12/david_bowie_s_blackstar_could_be_his_first_no_1_album_we_can_do_this_america.html|title=David Bowie's Blackstar Could Be His First No. 1 Album.

On ''First Circle'',  Argentinian singer and multi-instrumentalist [[Pedro Aznar]] joined the group as drummer [[Paul Wertico]] replaced Gottlieb. Both Rodby and Wertico were members of the [[Fred Simon (musician)|Simon and Bard]] Group at the time and had played in Simon-Bard in [[Chicago]] before joining Metheny.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n''First Circle'' was Metheny's last album with ECM; he had been a key artist for the label but left following disagreements with the label's founder, [[Manfred Eicher]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n''[[Still Life (Talking)]]'' ([[Geffen Records|Geffen]], 1987) featured new Group members trumpeter [[Mark Ledford]], vocalist [[David Blamires]], and percussionist [[Armando Mar\u00e7al]]. Aznar returned for vocals and guitar on ''[[Letter from Home (album)|Letter from Home]]'' (Geffen, 1989).\n\nDuring this period the [[Steppenwolf Theater Company]] of Chicago featured compositions by Metheny and Mays for their production of Lyle Kessler's play ''[[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]]'', where it has remained special optional music for all productions of the play around the world since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMetheny then again delved into solo and band projects, and four years went by before the release of the next Group record, a live album titled ''[[The Road to You]]'' (Geffen, 1993), which featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums among new tunes. The group integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its work, notably Mays' use of synthesizers.\n\nMetheny and Mays themselves refer {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} to the next three Pat Metheny Group releases as a triptych: ''[[We Live Here]]'' (Geffen, 1995), ''[[Quartet (Pat Metheny album)|Quartet]]'' (Geffen, 1996), and ''[[Imaginary Day]]'' ([[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]]., 1997). Moving away from the Latin style which had dominated the releases of the previous ten years, these albums included experiments with sequenced synthetic drums on one track, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues, and sonata schemes.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWith ''[[Speaking of Now]]'' (Warner Bros., 2002), new Group members were added: drummer [[Antonio S\u00e1nchez (drummer)|Antonio S\u00e1nchez]] from [[Mexico City]], trumpeter [[Cuong Vu]] from [[Vietnam]], and bassist, vocalist, guitarist, and percussionist [[Richard Bona]] from [[Cameroon]].\n\n''[[The Way Up]]'' ([[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]], 2005) consists of one 68-minute-long piece (split into four sections for CD navigation) based on a pair of three-note kernels: The opening B, A#, F# and the derived B, A, F#. On ''The Way Up'', harmonica player [[Gregoire Maret|Gr\u00e9goire Maret]] from Switzerland was introduced as a new group member, while Bona contributed as a guest musician.\n\n==Side projects==\nOutside the Group, Metheny has shown different sides of his musical personality. He made the album ''[[Orchestrion (album)|Orchestrion]]'' ([[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]], 2010) with elaborate, custom mechanical instruments, allowing one person to compose and perform as a one-person orchestra. By contrast, his album ''[[Secret Story (album)|Secret Story]]'' (Geffen, 1992) used orchestral arrangements found more often in movie soundtracks, such as his own ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman (album)|The Falcon and the Snowman]]'' (EMI, 1985) and ''[[A Map of the World (album)|A Map of the World]]'' (Warner Bros., 1999). His solo acoustic guitar albums include ''[[New Chautauqua]]'' (ECM, 1979), ''[[One Quiet Night]]'' (Warner Bros., 2003), and ''[[What's It All About (Pat Metheny album)|What's It All About]]'' (Nonesuch, 2011). He explored the fringes of the avant-garde on ''[[Zero Tolerance for Silence]]'' (Geffen, 1994). This, too, was an album of solo guitar, but it was electric guitar, and to many fans and critics it was simply noise. Metheny had ventured into the avant-garde before on ''[[80/81]]'' (ECM, 1980), ''[[Song X]]'' (Geffen, 1986) with [[Ornette Coleman]], and ''The Sign of Four'' with [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]] (Knitting Factory Works, 1997).\n\nIn 1997, Metheny recorded with bassist [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] on Johnson's release ''[[The Sound of Summer Running]]'' (Verve, 1998). The next year, he recorded a [[Jim Hall & Pat Metheny|guitar duet]] with [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (Telarc, 1999), whose work has strongly influenced Metheny's. He collaborated with Polish jazz and folk singer [[Anna Maria Jopek]] on ''[[Upojenie]]'' (Warner Poland, 2002) and [[Bruce Hornsby]] on ''[[Hot House (Bruce Hornsby album)|Hot House]]'' (RCA, 2005).\n\nHe recorded on albums by his older brother, [[Mike Metheny]], a jazz trumpeter, among them ''Day In \u2013 Night Out'' (1986) and ''Close Enough for Love'' (2001).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemetheny.com |title=Mike Metheny official website |publisher=Mikemetheny.com |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.methenymusicfoundation.org/history.htm |title=Metheny Music Foundation, Inc |publisher=Methenymusicfoundation.org |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe long list of his collaborators includes [[Lyle Mays]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Billy Higgins]], [[Brad Mehldau]], [[Charlie Haden]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Dave Holland]], [[Dewey Redman]], [[Eberhard Weber]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[John Scofield]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Joshua Redman]], [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Mick Goodrick]], [[Roy Haynes]], [[Steve Swallow]], and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name=\"Forte\">{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=Dan|title=Pat Metheny: The Jazz Guitar Prodigy at 60|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/26318/pat-metheny-2/|website=Vintage Guitar magazine|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Unity Band==\nIn 2012, he formed the Unity Band with [[Antonio S\u00e1nchez (drummer)|Antonio S\u00e1nchez]] on drums, [[Ben Williams (musician)|Ben Williams]] on bass and [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] on saxophone. This ensemble toured Europe and the U.S. during the latter half of the year.

He worked extensively with Coleman's collaborators, such as [[Charlie Haden]], [[Dewey Redman]], and [[Billy Higgins]], and he recorded the album ''[[Song X]]'' (1986) with Coleman and toured with him.\n\nMetheny made three albums on ECM with Brazilian vocalist and percussionist [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]]. He lived in Brazil from the late 1980s to the early 1990s and performed with several local musicians, such as [[Milton Nascimento]] and [[Toninho Horta]]. He played with [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] as a tribute, in a live performance in ''[[Carnegie Hall]] Salutes The Jazz Masters: Verve 50th Anniversary''.\n\nHe is also a fan of several pop music artists, especially singer/songwriters including [[James Taylor]] (after whom he named the song \"James\" on ''Offramp''); [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], with whom he performed on her ''[[Shadows and Light (Joni Mitchell album)|Shadows and Light]]'' ([[Asylum Records|Asylum]]/[[Elektra Records|Elektra]], 1980) live tour. Metheny is also fond of [[Buckethead]]'s music. He also worked with, sponsored or helped to make recordings of singer/songwriters from all over the world, such as [[Pedro Aznar]] (Argentina), [[Akiko Yano]] (Japan), [[David Bowie]] (UK), [[Silje Nergaard]] (Norway), [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] (Israel), and [[Anna Maria Jopek]] (Poland).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patmetheny.com/pat_recommends.cfm |title=Pat Metheny |publisher=Pat Metheny |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>\n\nTwo of Metheny's albums, ''[[The Way Up]]'' (2005) and ''[[Orchestrion (album)|Orchestrion]]'' (2010), show the influence of American minimalist composer [[Steve Reich]] and use similar rhythmic figures structured around pulse. Metheny recorded Reich's composition \"[[Electric Counterpoint]]\" on Reich's album ''[[Different Trains]]'' (Nonesuch, 1987).\n\n==Guitars==\n[[File:MethenyPikasso.JPG|thumb|Metheny with the 42-string Pikasso]]\n\n===Pikasso===\n{{Main|Pikasso guitar}}\nMetheny plays a custom-made 42-string [[Pikasso guitar|Pikasso I]] created by Canadian luthier [[Linda Manzer]]. He plays it on \"Into the Dream\" and on the albums ''[[Quartet (Pat Metheny album)|Quartet]]'' (1996), ''[[Imaginary Day]]'' (1997), ''[[Jim Hall & Pat Metheny]]'' (1999), ''[[Trio \u2192 Live]]'' (Warner Bros., 2000), and the ''Speaking of Now Live'' and ''Imaginary Day Live'' DVDs. Metheny has used the guitar in his guest appearances on other artists' albums. He used the Pikasso on ''[[Metheny/Mehldau Quartet]]'' (Nonesuch, 2007), his second collaboration with pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and his trio sidemen [[Larry Grenadier]] and [[Jeff Ballard (musician)|Jeff Ballard]]; the Pikasso is featured on Metheny's composition \"The Sound of Water\". Manzer has made many acoustic guitars for Metheny, including a mini guitar, an acoustic sitar guitar, and the [[baritone guitar]], which Metheny used for the recording of ''[[One Quiet Night]]'' (2003).\n\n===Guitar synthesizer===\n[[File:Pat Metheny Venice.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Metheny with the guitar synthesizer]]\nMetheny was one of the first jazz guitarists to use the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland GR-300|GR-300]] [[guitar/synthesizer|Guitar Synthesizer]].

His brother, father, and grandfather played trios together at home. His parents were fans of [[Glenn Miller]] and swing music. They took Metheny to concerts to hear [[Clark Terry]] and [[Doc Severinsen]], but they had little respect for guitar.  Metheny's interest in guitar increased around 1964 when he saw [[the Beatles]] perform on TV. For his 12th birthday, his parents allowed him to buy a guitar, which was a [[Gibson ES-140]] 3/4.<ref name=\"Niles\">{{cite book|last1=Niles|first1=Richard|title=The Pat Metheny Interviews: The Inner Workings of His Creativity Revealed|date=2009|publisher=Hal Leonard Books|location=Milwaukee, WI |isbn=978-1-4234-7469-2|pages=4\u201323}}</ref>\n\nMetheny's life changed after hearing the album ''[[Four & More]]'' by [[Miles Davis]]. Soon after, he was captivated by [[Wes Montgomery]]'s album ''[[Smokin' at the Half Note]]'' which was released in 1965. He cites the Beatles, Miles Davis, and Wes Montgomery as having the biggest impact on his music.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nWhen he was 15, he won a scholarship from ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine to a one-week jazz camp where he was mentored by guitarist [[Attila Zoller]], who then invited Metheny to New York City to see guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] and bassist [[Ron Carter]].<ref name=\"Taylor1999\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Taylor |first=B.

After less than a week at college, Metheny realized that playing guitar all day during his teens had left him unprepared for classes. He admitted this to Lee, who offered him a job to teach instead, as the school had recently introduced electric guitar as a course of study.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nHe moved to Boston to teach at the [[Berklee College of Music]] with jazz vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]]<ref name=\"Taylor1999\" /> and established a reputation as a prodigy.<ref name=\"Chinen2010\">{{cite web| last1=Chinen| first1=Nate| title=19th-Century Concept, With a Few Upgrades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/arts/music/31metheny.html|website=New York Times| accessdate=5 April 2010|date=28 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Debut album===\nIn 1974 he appeared on an album unofficially titled ''[[Jaco (album)|Jaco]]'' with pianist [[Paul Bley]], bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]], and drummer [[Bruce Ditmas]] for Carol Goss's [[Improvising Artists]] label. But he was unaware that he was being recorded. During the next year, he joined Gary Burton's band with guitarist [[Mick Goodrick]].\n\nMetheny released his debut album, ''[[Bright Size Life]]'' ([[ECM Records|ECM]], 1976) with [[Jaco Pastorius]] on bass guitar and [[Rakalam Bob Moses|Bob Moses]] on drums. His next album, ''[[Watercolors (Pat Metheny album)|Watercolors]]'' (ECM, 1977), was the first time he recorded with pianist [[Lyle Mays]], who became his most frequent collaborator. The album also featured [[Danny Gottlieb]], who became the drummer for the first version of the [[Pat Metheny Group]].<ref name=\"Ginell\">{{cite web| last1=Ginell| first1=Richard| title=Watercolors|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/watercolors-mw0000649643| website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> With Metheny, Mays, and Gottlieb, the fourth member was bassist [[Mark Egan]] when the album ''[[Pat Metheny Group (album)|Pat Metheny Group]]'' (ECM, 1978) was released.\n\n==Pat Metheny Group==\n{{Main|Pat Metheny Group}}\n[[Image:Steve Rodby and Pat Metheny.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Steve Rodby]] and Pat Metheny]]\nWhen ''[[Pat Metheny Group (album)|Pat Metheny Group]]'' (ECM, 1978) was released, the Group was a quartet comprising, besides Metheny, [[Danny Gottlieb]] on drums, [[Mark Egan]] on bass, and [[Lyle Mays]] on piano, [[autoharp]] and synthesizer. All but Egan had played on Metheny's album [[Watercolors (Pat Metheny album)|Watercolors]] (ECM, 1977), recorded a year before the first Group album.<ref name=\"Niles\" />\n\nThe second Group album, ''[[American Garage]]'' (ECM, 1979), reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Jazz chart and crossed over onto the pop charts. From 1982 to 1985, the Pat Metheny Group released ''[[Offramp (album)|Offramp]]'' (ECM, 1982), a live album, ''[[Travels (Pat Metheny Group album)|Travels]]'' (ECM, 1983), ''[[First Circle (album)|First Circle]]'' (ECM, 1984), and ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman (album)|The Falcon and the Snowman]]'' (EMI, 1985), a soundtrack album for the movie of the same name in which they collaborated on the single \"[[This Is Not America]]\" with [[David Bowie]]. The song reached number 14 in the British Top 40 in 1985 and number 32 in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/01/12/david_bowie_s_blackstar_could_be_his_first_no_1_album_we_can_do_this_america.html|title=David Bowie's Blackstar Could Be His First No. 1 Album.

On ''First Circle'',  Argentinian singer and multi-instrumentalist [[Pedro Aznar]] joined the group as drummer [[Paul Wertico]] replaced Gottlieb. Both Rodby and Wertico were members of the [[Fred Simon (musician)|Simon and Bard]] Group at the time and had played in Simon-Bard in [[Chicago]] before joining Metheny.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n''First Circle'' was Metheny's last album with ECM; he had been a key artist for the label but left following disagreements with the label's founder, [[Manfred Eicher]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n''[[Still Life (Talking)]]'' ([[Geffen Records|Geffen]], 1987) featured new Group members trumpeter [[Mark Ledford]], vocalist [[David Blamires]], and percussionist [[Armando Mar\u00e7al]]. Aznar returned for vocals and guitar on ''[[Letter from Home (album)|Letter from Home]]'' (Geffen, 1989).\n\nDuring this period the [[Steppenwolf Theater Company]] of Chicago featured compositions by Metheny and Mays for their production of Lyle Kessler's play ''[[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]]'', where it has remained special optional music for all productions of the play around the world since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMetheny then again delved into solo and band projects, and four years went by before the release of the next Group record, a live album titled ''[[The Road to You]]'' (Geffen, 1993), which featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums among new tunes. The group integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its work, notably Mays' use of synthesizers.\n\nMetheny and Mays themselves refer {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} to the next three Pat Metheny Group releases as a triptych: ''[[We Live Here]]'' (Geffen, 1995), ''[[Quartet (Pat Metheny album)|Quartet]]'' (Geffen, 1996), and ''[[Imaginary Day]]'' ([[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]]., 1997). Moving away from the Latin style which had dominated the releases of the previous ten years, these albums included experiments with sequenced synthetic drums on one track, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues, and sonata schemes.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWith ''[[Speaking of Now]]'' (Warner Bros., 2002), new Group members were added: drummer [[Antonio S\u00e1nchez (drummer)|Antonio S\u00e1nchez]] from [[Mexico City]], trumpeter [[Cuong Vu]] from [[Vietnam]], and bassist, vocalist, guitarist, and percussionist [[Richard Bona]] from [[Cameroon]].\n\n''[[The Way Up]]'' ([[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]], 2005) consists of one 68-minute-long piece (split into four sections for CD navigation) based on a pair of three-note kernels: The opening B, A#, F# and the derived B, A, F#. On ''The Way Up'', harmonica player [[Gregoire Maret|Gr\u00e9goire Maret]] from Switzerland was introduced as a new group member, while Bona contributed as a guest musician.\n\n==Side projects==\nOutside the Group, Metheny has shown different sides of his musical personality. He made the album ''[[Orchestrion (album)|Orchestrion]]'' ([[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]], 2010) with elaborate, custom mechanical instruments, allowing one person to compose and perform as a one-person orchestra. By contrast, his album ''[[Secret Story (album)|Secret Story]]'' (Geffen, 1992) used orchestral arrangements found more often in movie soundtracks, such as his own ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman (album)|The Falcon and the Snowman]]'' (EMI, 1985) and ''[[A Map of the World (album)|A Map of the World]]'' (Warner Bros., 1999). His solo acoustic guitar albums include ''[[New Chautauqua]]'' (ECM, 1979), ''[[One Quiet Night]]'' (Warner Bros., 2003), and ''[[What's It All About (Pat Metheny album)|What's It All About]]'' (Nonesuch, 2011). He explored the fringes of the avant-garde on ''[[Zero Tolerance for Silence]]'' (Geffen, 1994). This, too, was an album of solo guitar, but it was electric guitar, and to many fans and critics it was simply noise. Metheny had ventured into the avant-garde before on ''[[80/81]]'' (ECM, 1980), ''[[Song X]]'' (Geffen, 1986) with [[Ornette Coleman]], and ''The Sign of Four'' with [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]] (Knitting Factory Works, 1997).\n\nIn 1997, Metheny recorded with bassist [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] on Johnson's release ''[[The Sound of Summer Running]]'' (Verve, 1998). The next year, he recorded a [[Jim Hall & Pat Metheny|guitar duet]] with [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (Telarc, 1999), whose work has strongly influenced Metheny's. He collaborated with Polish jazz and folk singer [[Anna Maria Jopek]] on ''[[Upojenie]]'' (Warner Poland, 2002) and [[Bruce Hornsby]] on ''[[Hot House (Bruce Hornsby album)|Hot House]]'' (RCA, 2005).\n\nHe recorded on albums by his older brother, [[Mike Metheny]], a jazz trumpeter, among them ''Day In \u2013 Night Out'' (1986) and ''Close Enough for Love'' (2001).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemetheny.com |title=Mike Metheny official website |publisher=Mikemetheny.com |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.methenymusicfoundation.org/history.htm |title=Metheny Music Foundation, Inc |publisher=Methenymusicfoundation.org |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe long list of his collaborators includes [[Lyle Mays]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Billy Higgins]], [[Brad Mehldau]], [[Charlie Haden]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Dave Holland]], [[Dewey Redman]], [[Eberhard Weber]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[John Scofield]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Joshua Redman]], [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Mick Goodrick]], [[Roy Haynes]], [[Steve Swallow]], and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name=\"Forte\">{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=Dan|title=Pat Metheny: The Jazz Guitar Prodigy at 60|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/26318/pat-metheny-2/|website=Vintage Guitar magazine|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Unity Band==\nIn 2012, he formed the Unity Band with [[Antonio S\u00e1nchez (drummer)|Antonio S\u00e1nchez]] on drums, [[Ben Williams (musician)|Ben Williams]] on bass and [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] on saxophone. This ensemble toured Europe and the U.S. during the latter half of the year.

He worked extensively with Coleman's collaborators, such as [[Charlie Haden]], [[Dewey Redman]], and [[Billy Higgins]], and he recorded the album ''[[Song X]]'' (1986) with Coleman and toured with him.\n\nMetheny made three albums on ECM with Brazilian vocalist and percussionist [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]]. He lived in Brazil from the late 1980s to the early 1990s and performed with several local musicians, such as [[Milton Nascimento]] and [[Toninho Horta]]. He played with [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] as a tribute, in a live performance in ''[[Carnegie Hall]] Salutes The Jazz Masters: Verve 50th Anniversary''.\n\nHe is also a fan of several pop music artists, especially singer/songwriters including [[James Taylor]] (after whom he named the song \"James\" on ''Offramp''); [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], with whom he performed on her ''[[Shadows and Light (Joni Mitchell album)|Shadows and Light]]'' ([[Asylum Records|Asylum]]/[[Elektra Records|Elektra]], 1980) live tour. Metheny is also fond of [[Buckethead]]'s music. He also worked with, sponsored or helped to make recordings of singer/songwriters from all over the world, such as [[Pedro Aznar]] (Argentina), [[Akiko Yano]] (Japan), [[David Bowie]] (UK), [[Silje Nergaard]] (Norway), [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] (Israel), and [[Anna Maria Jopek]] (Poland).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patmetheny.com/pat_recommends.cfm |title=Pat Metheny |publisher=Pat Metheny |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>\n\nTwo of Metheny's albums, ''[[The Way Up]]'' (2005) and ''[[Orchestrion (album)|Orchestrion]]'' (2010), show the influence of American minimalist composer [[Steve Reich]] and use similar rhythmic figures structured around pulse. Metheny recorded Reich's composition \"[[Electric Counterpoint]]\" on Reich's album ''[[Different Trains]]'' (Nonesuch, 1987).\n\n==Guitars==\n[[File:MethenyPikasso.JPG|thumb|Metheny with the 42-string Pikasso]]\n\n===Pikasso===\n{{Main|Pikasso guitar}}\nMetheny plays a custom-made 42-string [[Pikasso guitar|Pikasso I]] created by Canadian luthier [[Linda Manzer]].

Metheny has used the guitar in his guest appearances on other artists' albums. He used the Pikasso on ''[[Metheny/Mehldau Quartet]]'' (Nonesuch, 2007), his second collaboration with pianist [[Brad Mehldau]] and his trio sidemen [[Larry Grenadier]] and [[Jeff Ballard (musician)|Jeff Ballard]]; the Pikasso is featured on Metheny's composition \"The Sound of Water\".

In this second season, Laverne and Shirley were joined by [[the Fonz]] and his dog Mr. Cool, from the 1980-1981 animated show ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]''.

An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.<ref name = \"landsburg\"/><ref name=\"hartmann\">[[Thom Hartmann]], ''Unequal Protection'', Second Edition, Chapter 20. p. 255</ref>\n\nMost economists would recommend that even [[developing nations]] should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]], a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system.<ref name=\"autogenerated311\">Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 311\u2013312.</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: Good Policies and Good Institutions in Historical Perspective|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDECINEQ/Resources/KAL-SummaryPaper.doc}}</ref> Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.\n\nIf the chief justification for a tariff is to [[Infant industry argument|stimulate infant industries]], it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as [[import substitution industrialization]], is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.<ref name=\"autogenerated311\"/>\n\n==== Tariffs ====\n[[File:EffectOfTariff.svg|thumb|upright=2.10|The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff]]\nThe chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market (and hence in the domestic market) is P<sub>world</sub>. The tariff increases the domestic price to P<sub>tariff</sub>. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from Q<sub>S1</sub> to Q<sub>S2</sub> and causes domestic consumption to decline from Q<sub>C1</sub> to Q<sub>C2</sub>.<ref name=\"stockman\">Alan C. Stockman, ''Introduction to Economics'', Second Edition, Chapter 9.</ref><ref name=\"Mankiw\">[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], ''Macroeconomics'', Fifth Edition, Chapter 7.</ref>\n\nThis has three main effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.<ref name=\"stockman\"/><ref name=\"Mankiw\"/>\n\nAn almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.<ref name=\"landsburg\"/>\n\nSometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses.<ref name=\"landsburg\"/>\n\n=== Trade diversion ===\nAccording to [[mainstream economics]] theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to [[efficiency (economics)|economic inefficiency]] through the process of [[trade diversion]]. It is economically efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the [[Doha Round]].<ref name=\"landsburg\">[[Steven E. Landsburg]].

Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced (New England was famous for smuggling), but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the [[American Revolution]]. \"The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong\", wrote Dickerson, \"was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders\".<ref>Dickerson, ''The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution'', p. 140.</ref>\n\nFree trade came to what would become the United States as a result of [[American Revolutionary War]].

A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Bairoch]], since the end of the 18th century the United States has been \"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] strongly opposed it. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator [[Henry Clay]] continued [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s themes within the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] under the name [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%.<ref>Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 66</ref> The American economist [[C.

According to this model, trade policy is dynamically unstable in that it constantly tends towards either liberalisation or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and [[multilateral trade negotiations]] must constantly pedal towards greater liberalisation. To achieve greater liberalisation, decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work as this will both reduce the backlash against globalisation and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.<ref>Destler, Mac and Noland, Marcus (July 2, 2014).

The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the [[Corn Laws]] which restricted import of grain in 1846 in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for manufactures only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40\u201350% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century.<ref>Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 17</ref> The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands and to a lesser degree Belgium.<ref>Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 59</ref> Chang describes the [[export-oriented industrialization]] policies of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] as \"far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents\".<ref>Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 50</ref>\n\n===== Free trade in goods =====\n{{main|Global Enabling Trade Report}}\nThe [[Global Enabling Trade Report]] measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destinations.

A general argument against free trade is that it represents [[colonialism]] or [[imperialism]] in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns about:<ref>[[Donald J.

Free trade allows companies from rich countries to directly invest in poor countries, sharing their knowledge, providing capital and giving access to markets.\n\nEconomic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories.

Some opponents of [[NAFTA]] see the agreement as materially harming the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade ''per se''. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let [[Agricultural subsidy| subsidized]] corn from the United States into Mexico freely under [[NAFTA]] at prices well below production cost ([[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers. Indeed, such subsidies violate free-trade theory, so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade, but rather against its selective implementation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nResearch shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title = Learning to Love Globalization: Education and Individual Attitudes Toward International Trade |journal = International Organization |date = 2006-04-01 |issn = 1531-5088 |pages = 469\u2013498 |volume = 60 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1017/S0020818306060140 |first = Jens |last = Hainmueller |first2 = Michael J. |last2 = Hiscox |citeseerx = 10.1.1.407.4650}}</ref> Hainmueller and Hiscox find <blockquote>\"that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena, than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security.

Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying [[tariff]]s to imports or [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include [[import quotas]], taxes and [[non-tariff barrier]]s, such as regulatory [[legislation]].\n\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of the 1970s]]). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Federico|first=Giovanni|last2=Tena-Junguito|first2=Antonio|date=2019|journal=Revista de Historia Economica - Journal of Iberian and Latin American Economic History|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=9\u201341|doi=10.1017/S0212610918000216|issn=0212-6109|title=World Trade, 1800-1938: A New Synthesis}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/world-trade-historical-database|title=The World Trade Historical Database|last=Federico|first=Giovanni|last2=Tena-Junguito|first2=Antonio|date=2018-07-28|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Bown|first=C.

An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.<ref name = \"landsburg\"/><ref name=\"hartmann\">[[Thom Hartmann]], ''Unequal Protection'', Second Edition, Chapter 20. p. 255</ref>\n\nMost economists would recommend that even [[developing nations]] should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]], a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system.<ref name=\"autogenerated311\">Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 311\u2013312.</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: Good Policies and Good Institutions in Historical Perspective|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDECINEQ/Resources/KAL-SummaryPaper.doc}}</ref> Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.\n\nIf the chief justification for a tariff is to [[Infant industry argument|stimulate infant industries]], it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as [[import substitution industrialization]], is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.<ref name=\"autogenerated311\"/>\n\n==== Tariffs ====\n[[File:EffectOfTariff.svg|thumb|upright=2.10|The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff]]\nThe chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market (and hence in the domestic market) is P<sub>world</sub>. The tariff increases the domestic price to P<sub>tariff</sub>. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from Q<sub>S1</sub> to Q<sub>S2</sub> and causes domestic consumption to decline from Q<sub>C1</sub> to Q<sub>C2</sub>.<ref name=\"stockman\">Alan C. Stockman, ''Introduction to Economics'', Second Edition, Chapter 9.</ref><ref name=\"Mankiw\">[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], ''Macroeconomics'', Fifth Edition, Chapter 7.</ref>\n\nThis has three main effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.<ref name=\"stockman\"/><ref name=\"Mankiw\"/>\n\nAn almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.<ref name=\"landsburg\"/>\n\nSometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses.<ref name=\"landsburg\"/>\n\n=== Trade diversion ===\nAccording to [[mainstream economics]] theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to [[efficiency (economics)|economic inefficiency]] through the process of [[trade diversion]]. It is economically efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the [[Doha Round]].<ref name=\"landsburg\">[[Steven E. Landsburg]].

Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced (New England was famous for smuggling), but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the [[American Revolution]]. \"The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong\", wrote Dickerson, \"was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders\".<ref>Dickerson, ''The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution'', p. 140.</ref>\n\nFree trade came to what would become the United States as a result of [[American Revolutionary War]].

A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Bairoch]], since the end of the 18th century the United States has been \"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] strongly opposed it. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator [[Henry Clay]] continued [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s themes within the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] under the name [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the [[Corn Laws]] which restricted import of grain in 1846 in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for manufactures only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950.

Some opponents of [[NAFTA]] see the agreement as materially harming the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade ''per se''. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let [[Agricultural subsidy| subsidized]] corn from the United States into Mexico freely under [[NAFTA]] at prices well below production cost ([[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers.
