After a failed attempt at faking [[insanity]], they make friends with Jesus Ramirez, a bank robber, and Rory Schultebrand, a [[gay]] man who killed his stepfather, and meet inmates such as contrabandist Jack Graham, ax murderer Blade and intimidating mass murderer Grossberger.\n\nStrangely, while Harry is understandably terrified of the brutality of the guards and inmates, Skip seems to be [[Optimism|optimistic]] and happy about the situation. At one point, the guards put Skip in a small, dark box for a few days of [[solitary confinement]] expecting to find him a [[Stir crazy (condition)|crazy mess]] when they bring him out. Instead he asks them for one more day as he \"was just beginning to get into [himself]\".\n\nThree months later, Skip and Harry are brought to see Warden Walter Beatty and Deputy Warden Wilson, the head guard. They wish to run a \"test\" with Harry and Skip on a [[mechanical bull]] in the warden's office. To everyone's surprise, Skip rides the bull at full power, so Beatty selects him to compete in the prison's annual rodeo competition.\n\nJesus and Rory inform Harry and Skip of the truth behind the rodeo: it is a crooked operation run by Beatty and Warden Henry Sampson, who heads the neighboring prison. The money from the rodeo, which is supposed to go to the prisoners, ends up in the wardens' pockets. Knowing Skip will be selected as the prison's new champion, Jesus and Rory hatch a plan for escape involving Skip refusing to participate. This backfires as the warden orders Wilson to \"straighten Skip out\", and the guards [[torture]] Skip and Harry. However, this too fails; as Skip continues to enjoy himself and when the guards suspend Skip from the floor with manacles in one of the cells they only succeed in fixing his bad back injury that he got from riding the mechanical bull earlier.\n\nHarry and Skip are visited by Garber, who introduces them to his partner in the mission to prove them innocent, his cousin Meredith, to whom Skip is immediately attracted. Later, Skip meets with Beatty to make a deal. In exchange for his participation in the rodeo, Skip requests his own crew (Harry, Jesus, Rory and Grossberger), along with a larger jail cell. Beatty agrees, telling Wilson to have a guard watch them at all times. Wilson reveals to the guard, Graham, that Skip will not leave the rodeo alive. \n\nWhile practicing for the rodeo, Skip, Harry, Jesus, Rory, and Grossberger acquire tools they need for their escape, using the prison's metal shop to transform them into seemingly everyday items. Meredith gets a job as a waitress in a country western [[strip club]] searching for possible suspects and encounters the real crooks. She calls Garber and the police.\n\nThe rodeo begins, but attempts to kill Skip fail. During the major events, each member of Skip's team escape through a secret opening, taking them through air vents to either a restroom where Jesus' wife provides them disguises, or through a vent to a hollow pushcart manned by Jesus' brother. Once through, they put on their disguises and re-enter the grounds as audience members.\n\nSkip is to compete against champion Caesar Geronimo to swipe the prize: a bag of money from the horns of a large, [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]] bull. Skip asks Caesar if he is tired of being his warden's stooge, suggesting that they give the money to the prisoners and offering to help Caesar win if he agrees to do so. Both contestants play hard, but Caesar wins. Inspired by Skip, Caesar throws the bag to the inmates. Skip prepares his escape through the secret opening, but Graham shows up, suspicious. Grossberger knocks Graham out and Skip escapes into the pushcart. The group drive off.\n\nAt a secret meeting spot, Jesus and Rory bid Harry and Skip farewell as they leave for [[Mexico]]. Harry and Skip get in the other car, only to be stopped by a car containing Garber and Meredith. She tells Harry and Skip that the police have captured the real crooks. Harry and Skip decide to resume their original plan of heading to Hollywood. Skip asks Meredith to go with him, and Meredith agrees.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Skip Donahue\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Harry Monroe\n* [[Georg Stanford Brown]] as Rory Schultebrand\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Meredith\n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Su\u00e1rez]] as Jesus Ramirez\n* [[Craig T.

While the duo are on break, two men steal the costumes and rob the bank. However, Harry and Skip are arrested, whisked through a speedy trial and handed 125-year jail sentences.

We meet Manny's mother Eva ([[Erica Yohn]]) and father Harry ([[Don Ameche]]) and the other characters. As friends and family leave, it is apparent that Manny is in for difficulty. Molly will no longer speak due to her mother's passing, and there is a need for a housekeeper/nanny so that Manny can return to a shaky job writing commercial jingles for his best friend and boss, Sid ([[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]]).\n\nAfter one nanny washes out, Corrina Washington ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) interviews for the position. Molly responds well to Corrina and Manny hires her. Very quickly a strong bond is formed between them. Corrina works out a system to \"talk\" with her without making her speak. Corrina sees the early struggles of life after Annie's passing, and Molly slowly begins to interact more with Corrina. Molly also begins to spend time with Corrina's sister and family, who take her to church and welcome her into their home. At an office party, Manny is introduced to Jenny ([[Wendy Crewson]]), a perky white divorcee with two sons. Manny is still struggling with losing Annie and is not ready to date. Corrina's sister Jevina encourages her to date a black man, Anthony, but Corrina isn't interested.\n\nA frightened Molly returns to school where she is mocked for adding Corrina to her family picture. She runs into Corrina's arms at the end of the day, desperate to go home. That night, Molly awakes from a nightmare, Corrina and Manny run to her side but she is scared and angry. Corrina tells her she is allowed to be mad. Manny admits to her how hurt he is about losing Annie and how much he misses her too. That night Jevina chastises Corrina for pretending to become a part of this family.\n\nA terrified Molly begs Corrina to let her stay home from school and she secretly agrees. Corrina spends more time with them, and she and Manny slowly discover they are more compatible with each other than anyone else. He confides in her about Annie and she talks about her long gone former husband. They share a love of music and she even assists him on his new jingle. After a successful advertising campaign, he comes home with flowers for Molly as well as Corrina. Their private celebration is interrupted by a visit from Jenny, which Corrina takes as a cue that she is not meant to stay.\n\nThe next day, a flustered Corrina goes to work where Manny apologizes for Jenny's uninvited visit. As they say goodbye, they share a kiss on the cheek, which Manny's nosey neighbor sees. Corrina and Manny begin to fall in love and face prejudice as an interracial couple. Molly asks her grandfather Harry to make sure that Manny marries Corrina. That night, Corrina and Manny talk about their spouses and share a moonlight dance and kiss that is witnessed by Molly.\n\nAfter weeks of not attending school, Corrina thinks it's almost time for Molly to go back, but she says she's not yet ready, and Manny finds out that Corrina had been letting her skip school. In a fit of anger, he tells her that she is not Molly's mother and fires her, taking a heartbroken Molly home. Molly becomes withdrawn again, and Manny learns that Harry has died. After the funeral, he goes to visit Corrina at her house to tell her of Harry's passing and to properly apologize. After an unsuccessful talk, she overhears his not-so quiet prayers to God to help him out. She informs him that she quit and he assures her that she was replaced. They embrace and he begins to kiss her. She brings him inside to formally meet her family. The film ends with Molly singing \"[[This Little Light of Mine]]\" in order to cheer up Eva.

The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate [[Henry Hill]] and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'' and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to ''Goodfellas''. To prepare for their roles in the film, [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Ray Liotta]] often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with [[Silver Lion]] for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990. The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed $46.8 million. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], with Pesci winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film won five awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]]. Additionally, ''Goodfellas'' was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\n\n''Goodfellas'' is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrie |first=Stephanie |title='Goodfellas' is 25.

He begins working for local ''[[caporegime]]'' Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, an Irish truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] carousing with women. Henry starts dating [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], a Jewish woman. She is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities but is eventually seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She marries him, despite her parents' disapproval.\n\nIn 1970, [[William Bentvena|Billy Batts]], a [[made man]] in the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino crew]] who was recently released from prison, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. This provoked his murder by Tommy and Jimmy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder by burying the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse.\n\nIn 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress Janice and holds Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. In order to support his family on the outside, Henry has drugs smuggled in by Karen and sells them to a fellow inmate from [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands this cocaine business against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy.\n\nJimmy organizes a crew to raid the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa vault]] at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], stealing several millions in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. In his [[Voice-over|voiceover]] narration, as dead bodies are being discovered all over the city, Henry theorizes that Jimmy would have killed them anyway rather than share the profits of the heist. Tommy and Henry are spared by Jimmy. Tommy, however, is later led to believe that he is to become a made man, but is ultimately shot dead on the way to the ceremony in retribution for Batts' murder.\n\nBy 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He sets up a drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an [[informant]] and enroll, with his family, in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Henry is grateful to be alive, but he is forced out of his gangster life and has to readjust to normal life once again; he narrates, \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a [[schnook]].\"\n\nThe end title cards state that Henry is still a protected witness as of 1990, but that he was arrested in 1987 in [[Seattle]] for narcotics conspiracy, receiving five years' probation. He has been clean since then. He and Karen separated in 1989 after 25 years of marriage, while Paulie died the previous year in [[Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth|Fort Worth Federal Prison]] at age 73 from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20 years to life sentence in a New York prison for murder, in which he will be paroled in 2004, when he will be 78 years old.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

The director wanted to take the gangster film and deal with it episode by episode, but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards. Scorsese compacted scenes, realizing that, if they were kept short, \"the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific.\"<ref name=Thompson /> He wanted to do the voiceover like the opening of ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' (1962) and use \"all the basic tricks of the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] from around 1961.\"<ref name=Thompson /> The names of several real-life gangsters were altered for the film: [[Thomas DeSimone|Tommy \"Two Gun\" DeSimone]] became the character Tommy DeVito; [[Paul Vario]] became Paulie Cicero, and [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy \"The Gent\" Burke]] was portrayed as Jimmy Conway.<ref name=\"Hughes pp176-177\">{{cite book |author=Hughes, Howard |title=Crime Wave: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Crime Movies |pages=176\u2013177}}</ref> Scorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'', but later, he and Pileggi decided to change the title of their film to ''Goodfellas'' because two contemporary projects, the 1986 [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[Wise Guys (1986 film)|Wise Guys]]'' and the 1987\u20131990 TV series ''[[Wiseguy]]'' had used similar titles.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Casting ===\nOnce [[Robert De Niro]] agreed to play Conway, Scorsese was able to secure the money needed to make the film.<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> The director cast [[Ray Liotta]] after De Niro saw him in [[Jonathan Demme]]'s ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1986), and Scorsese was surprised by \"his explosive energy\" in that film.<ref name=Gilbert /> Liotta had read Pileggi's book when it came out and was fascinated by it.

The filmmaker stated, \"[I] wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [Henry's] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Kathleen\" /> He added that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze frames]], and multiple locale switches.<ref name=Clark /> It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, \"So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?\u2014That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show.\"<ref name=Clark /> He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information.<ref name=Thompson /> He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich. Freeze frames were used as Scorsese wanted images that stopped \"because a point was being reached\" in Henry's life.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n[[Joe Pesci]] did not judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did.<ref name=Linfield /> Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her \"work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor.\"<ref name=Linfield /> When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nAccording to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.<ref name=Arnold /> For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced.

Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nThe long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, \"It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him.\"<ref name=Thompson /> This sequence was shot eight times.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\nHenry's last day as a wiseguy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by [[cocaine]] and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] intoxication.<ref name=Thompson /> In an interview with movie critic [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]], Scorsese explained the reason for Pesci shooting at the camera at the end of the film, \"well that's a reference right to the end of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to ''The Great Train Robbery''. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, \"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do\u2014and maybe with the system which allows this.\"<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.\"<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref name=Gilbert /> With a budget of $25 million, ''Goodfellas'' was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \"agitated\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese and the film's editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.<ref name=Kaplan /> One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Do I amuse you?\" scene.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Goodfellas (soundtrack)}}\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.<ref name=Gilbert /> In a given scene, he only used music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"[[Layla]]\" (1970) playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.<ref name=Thompson /> Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\n== Release ==\n===Theatrical===\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]], where Scorsese received the [[Silver Lion]] award for [[Silver Lion#Silver Lion for Best Direction|best director]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |title=The Venice Film Festival ends in uproar |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 17, 1990}}</ref> It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Goodfellas'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in March 1997, in a single-disc, double-sided, single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released a two-disc, dual-layer version, with [[remaster]]ed picture and sound, and bonus materials such as [[Audio commentary|commentary tracks]].<ref name=\"homevihist\" /> In early 2007 the film became available on single [[Blu-ray]] with all the features from the 2004 release; an expanded Blu-ray version was released in February 2010, bundled with a disc with features that include the 2008 documentary ''Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film.''<ref name=\"homevihist\">{{cite web |url=http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ |title=Making The (Up) Grade: ''Goodfellas'' |date=February 10, 2010 |first=Todd |last=Gilchrist |publisher=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=August 27, 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827133312/http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ | archive-date= August 27, 2014 | url-status= dead}}</ref> The film was released on 4K [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on December 6, 2016.<ref>{{Citation |title=GoodFellas 4K Blu-ray |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/ |accessdate=January 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020210/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Goodfellas'' opened in 1,070 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of [[United States dollar|US$]]6.3 million.

The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate [[Henry Hill]] and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'' and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to ''Goodfellas''. To prepare for their roles in the film, [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Ray Liotta]] often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with [[Silver Lion]] for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990. The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed $46.8 million. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], with Pesci winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film won five awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]]. Additionally, ''Goodfellas'' was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\n\n''Goodfellas'' is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrie |first=Stephanie |title='Goodfellas' is 25.

He begins working for local ''[[caporegime]]'' Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, an Irish truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] carousing with women. Henry starts dating [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], a Jewish woman. She is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities but is eventually seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She marries him, despite her parents' disapproval.\n\nIn 1970, [[William Bentvena|Billy Batts]], a [[made man]] in the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino crew]] who was recently released from prison, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. This provoked his murder by Tommy and Jimmy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder by burying the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse.\n\nIn 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress Janice and holds Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. In order to support his family on the outside, Henry has drugs smuggled in by Karen and sells them to a fellow inmate from [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands this cocaine business against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy.\n\nJimmy organizes a crew to raid the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa vault]] at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], stealing several millions in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. In his [[Voice-over|voiceover]] narration, as dead bodies are being discovered all over the city, Henry theorizes that Jimmy would have killed them anyway rather than share the profits of the heist. Tommy and Henry are spared by Jimmy. Tommy, however, is later led to believe that he is to become a made man, but is ultimately shot dead on the way to the ceremony in retribution for Batts' murder.\n\nBy 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He sets up a drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an [[informant]] and enroll, with his family, in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Henry is grateful to be alive, but he is forced out of his gangster life and has to readjust to normal life once again; he narrates, \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a [[schnook]].\"\n\nThe end title cards state that Henry is still a protected witness as of 1990, but that he was arrested in 1987 in [[Seattle]] for narcotics conspiracy, receiving five years' probation. He has been clean since then. He and Karen separated in 1989 after 25 years of marriage, while Paulie died the previous year in [[Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth|Fort Worth Federal Prison]] at age 73 from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20 years to life sentence in a New York prison for murder, in which he will be paroled in 2004, when he will be 78 years old.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show.\"<ref name=Clark /> He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information.<ref name=Thompson /> He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich. Freeze frames were used as Scorsese wanted images that stopped \"because a point was being reached\" in Henry's life.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n[[Joe Pesci]] did not judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did.<ref name=Linfield /> Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her \"work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor.\"<ref name=Linfield /> When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nAccording to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.<ref name=Arnold /> For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. Pesci was working as a waiter when he thought he was making a compliment to a mobster by saying he was \"funny\", however, the comment was not taken well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/goodfellas-joe-pesci-funny-how-scene-2015-5?r=US&IR=T|title=One of the most famous scenes in 'Goodfellas' is based on something that actually happened to Joe Pesci|publisher=businessinsider.com|date=May 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Gangster Films of All Time|author1=George Anastasia|author2=Glen Macnow|publisher=Running Press|year=2011|ISBN= 9780762441549|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ultimate+Book+of+Gangster+Movies:+Featuring+the+100+Greatest+Gangster+Films+of+All+Time&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivn5yd04HnAhUBUt8KHbkeAGkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=funny&f=false}}</ref> It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script.<ref name=Kaplan>{{cite video |people=Kaplan, Jonah (writer and editor); Stephen Altobellow and Jeffrey Schwartz (producers) |date=2004 |format=Blu-ray Disc |title=Getting Made: The Making of ''Goodfellas'' |work=Goodfellas |publisher=[[Warner Home Video]] |isbn=1-4198-4306-0}}</ref> The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised.

Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nThe long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, \"It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him.\"<ref name=Thompson /> This sequence was shot eight times.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\nHenry's last day as a wiseguy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by [[cocaine]] and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] intoxication.<ref name=Thompson /> In an interview with movie critic [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]], Scorsese explained the reason for Pesci shooting at the camera at the end of the film, \"well that's a reference right to the end of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to ''The Great Train Robbery''. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, \"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do\u2014and maybe with the system which allows this.\"<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.\"<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref name=Gilbert /> With a budget of $25 million, ''Goodfellas'' was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \"agitated\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese and the film's editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.<ref name=Kaplan /> One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Do I amuse you?\" scene.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Goodfellas (soundtrack)}}\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.<ref name=Gilbert /> In a given scene, he only used music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"[[Layla]]\" (1970) playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.<ref name=Thompson /> Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\n== Release ==\n===Theatrical===\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]], where Scorsese received the [[Silver Lion]] award for [[Silver Lion#Silver Lion for Best Direction|best director]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |title=The Venice Film Festival ends in uproar |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 17, 1990}}</ref> It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Goodfellas'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in March 1997, in a single-disc, double-sided, single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released a two-disc, dual-layer version, with [[remaster]]ed picture and sound, and bonus materials such as [[Audio commentary|commentary tracks]].<ref name=\"homevihist\" /> In early 2007 the film became available on single [[Blu-ray]] with all the features from the 2004 release; an expanded Blu-ray version was released in February 2010, bundled with a disc with features that include the 2008 documentary ''Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film.''<ref name=\"homevihist\">{{cite web |url=http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ |title=Making The (Up) Grade: ''Goodfellas'' |date=February 10, 2010 |first=Todd |last=Gilchrist |publisher=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=August 27, 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827133312/http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ | archive-date= August 27, 2014 | url-status= dead}}</ref> The film was released on 4K [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on December 6, 2016.<ref>{{Citation |title=GoodFellas 4K Blu-ray |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/ |accessdate=January 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020210/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Goodfellas'' opened in 1,070 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of [[United States dollar|US$]]6.3 million.

This season marked the introduction of [[Jerry Orbach]] as [[Lennie Briscoe]], who replaced [[Paul Sorvino]] after \"Prince of Darkness.\" (A year prior, Orbach had guest starred as a defense attorney in at least one episode season two episode two\u2019s \u201cWages of Love\u201d). At the end of the season, both [[Dann Florek]] and [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] departed the main cast.\n\n==Cast==\nSeason 3 began with an unchanged cast.  However, during the third and sixth episode, [[Carolyn McCormick]] was credited in the opening theme and starting with the ninth episode, she is credited for the rest of the season. This made her the first woman to be part of the cast in the series. A third of the way through, [[Lennie Briscoe]] (played by [[Jerry Orbach]]) replaced [[Phil Cerreta]] ([[Paul Sorvino]]) in the role of senior detective. This was the first mid-season replacement of a major character in ''Law & Order'''s history; the next would not occur until [[Law & Order (season 15)|season 15]]. This was also the final season to feature [[Dann Florek]] as Capt. [[Don Cragen]], and [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] as [[Paul Robinette]].  Both men would later return in guest roles, with Florek eventually joining the cast of ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.\n\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as [[Phil Cerreta|Sgt.

However, during the third and sixth episode, [[Carolyn McCormick]] was credited in the opening theme and starting with the ninth episode, she is credited for the rest of the season. This made her the first woman to be part of the cast in the series. A third of the way through, [[Lennie Briscoe]] (played by [[Jerry Orbach]]) replaced [[Phil Cerreta]] ([[Paul Sorvino]]) in the role of senior detective.

This was also the final season to feature [[Dann Florek]] as Capt. [[Don Cragen]], and [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] as [[Paul Robinette]].

It is based on [[John Ball (novelist)|John Ball]]'s 1965 [[In the Heat of the Night (novel)|novel of the same name]] and tells the story of [[Virgil Tibbs]], a black police [[detective]] from [[Philadelphia]], who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in [[Mississippi]]. It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Rod Steiger]], and was produced by [[Walter Mirisch]]. The screenplay was by [[Stirling Silliphant]].\n\nThe film won five [[Academy Awards]], including the [[40th Academy Awards|1967]] awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Rod Steiger for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe film was followed by two [[sequel]]s, ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' (1971). It was also the basis of a [[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|1988 television series]] adaptation of the same name.\n\nThe quote \"They call me ''Mister Tibbs!''{{-\"}} was listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!--As per WP:MOS-FILMS, the plot summary must not exceed 700 words-->\nIn 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Sparta, Mississippi]], to build a factory there. Late one night, police officer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body lying in the street.\n\nChief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for a few hours. At the train station, Wood finds a black man, [[Virgil Tibbs]], and arrests him. Gillespie accuses Tibbs of the murder, and is embarrassed to learn Tibbs is a police officer from [[Philadelphia]]. Gillespie phones Tibbs's chief, who informs Gillespie that Tibbs is a top homicide detective and recommends that he should assist the investigation. The idea does not appeal to either Gillespie or Tibbs, but for reasons of their own they reluctantly agree. Tibbs examines Colbert's body and concludes the murder happened earlier than the doctor had estimated, that the killer was right-handed, and that the victim had been killed elsewhere and then moved to where the body was found.\n\nGillespie arrests another suspect, who protests his innocence. The police are planning to beat him into confessing, but Tibbs reveals he is left-handed and has an alibi backed up by witnesses. Colbert's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the police and impressed by Tibbs. She threatens to halt construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation, and the town's leading citizens are forced to go along with her wish. The two policemen begin to respect each other as they are forced to work together.\n\nTibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a genteel racist and one of the most powerful individuals in town, who publicly opposed the new factory. When Tibbs interrogates Endicott, Endicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of thugs after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues Tibbs and tells him to leave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. \n\nTibbs asks Wood to re-trace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them. Tibbs reveals that Wood has changed the route of his patrol. Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder. He starts to suspect Wood and arrests him, despite Tibbs's protests. Purdy, a hostile local, brings his 16-year-old sister Delores to the police station and files charges against Wood for getting her pregnant. Tibbs insists on being present when Delores is questioned. Purdy is offended that a black man was present at his sister's questioning, and gathers a mob to attack Tibbs. Meanwhile, Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood of the murder charge, because he couldn't have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town. Tibbs adds that he knows why Wood changed his route: at night Delores likes to display her naked body to whoever is outside, and Wood, who watches her while on duty, did not want Tibbs to see a white woman in the nude.\n\nTibbs visits a [[Unsafe abortion#Illegal abortion|backstreet abortionist]], who under pressure reveals that she is about to perform an abortion on Delores. Delores arrives, sees Tibbs, and runs away. Tibbs follows her and comes face to face with her armed boyfriend, Ralph, a cook from a local roadside diner. At that moment Purdy's mob arrives on the scene and holds Tibbs at gunpoint. Tibbs shouts at Purdy to check Delores' purse, that it contains money Ralph gave her for an abortion, which he got when he robbed and killed Colbert. Purdy grabs the purse and looks inside, and realizes Tibbs is right. Purdy confronts Ralph for getting his sister pregnant, and a startled Ralph shoots Purdy dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun, and just then Gillespie arrives on the scene. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he had gone to ask Colbert for a job at the new factory, but ended up attacking him and taking his money. \"That's all. I didn't mean to kill him,\" are the final words of Ralph's taped confession.\n\nThe final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie, having carried his suitcase, respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-break}}\n*[[Sidney Poitier]] as [[Virgil Tibbs]]\n*[[Rod Steiger]] as Chief Bill Gillespie\n*[[Warren Oates]] as Sam Wood\n*[[Lee Grant]] as Mrs. Colbert\n*[[Larry Gates]] as Endicott\n*[[James Patterson (actor)|James Patterson]] as Mr. Purdy\n*[[William Schallert]] as Mayor Schubert\n*[[Beah Richards]] as Mama Caleba\n*[[Peter Whitney]] as Courtney\n{{Col-break|gap=2em}}\n*[[Kermit Murdock]] as Henderson\n*[[Larry D.

However, despite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] and [[Union City, Tennessee|Union City]], Tennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta, [[Chester, Illinois|Chester]] (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and [[Freeburg, Illinois|Freeburg]] (Compton's diner), Illinois.\n\nThe famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook ''Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History)'', Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature.\"<ref>Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History), Vivienne Sanders, Hodder Education, 2015</ref> However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] in his book, ''Pictures at a Revolution''. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.\n\nThe film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [[Haskell Wexler]] recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with better photographic results.<ref>Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''.

Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way.\"\n\nA particularly famous line in the film comes immediately after Gillespie mocks the name \"Virgil\" by saying \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?\" An annoyed Tibbs replies, \"They call me ''Mister'' Tibbs!\" This reply was later listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of [[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!|the sequel]].\n\nAnother iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him back. In a [[San Francisco]] pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.<ref>Harris, pp. 288\u201390.</ref> That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, ''[[Superspade|Super-spade]] Versus the Rednecks''.<ref>Harris, p. 336.</ref> During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.<ref>Harris, pp. 335\u20136</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThen-freshman critic [[Roger Ebert]] in 1967 gave ''In the Heat of the Night'' a positive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130707145722/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-10-best-lists-1967-present Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967 to Present.] [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' via the [[Internet Archive]].

Its consensus states, \"Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_heat_of_the_night/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=In the Heat of the Night, Movie Reviews |access-date=March 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Evaluation in film guides==\n''[[Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV]]'' (1972\u201373 edition) gives ''In the Heat of the Night'' its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an \"[E]xciting, superbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a small Mississippi town\", with the concluding sentences stating, \"[D]irector Norman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of life in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are uniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects.\" ''[[Leonard Maltin's TV Movies & Video Guide]]'' (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest rating of 4 stars, concluding that \"[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated one bit\u2014tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid Quincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture&nbsp;...\"\n\n''Mick Martin's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide'' (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\"\n\nBritish references, likewise, show high regard for the film, with [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] in his 1984 ''The Good Film and Video Guide'' giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that \"[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair, but it has enormous tension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates.\"\n\nAnother British film critic with a highly personal ''Film Guide'', [[Leslie Halliwell]], gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway.\" The ''Guide'' continued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, ''Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide 2007'', John Walker, who took over as the ''Guide's'' author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is \"[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting personalities.\"\n\n==Home media==\n''In the Heat of the Night'' was first released on [[DVD]] in 2001. In 2010, the film was digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on [[MGM HD]].\n\nIn 2014, MGM released the film on [[Blu-ray]].

It is based on [[John Ball (novelist)|John Ball]]'s 1965 [[In the Heat of the Night (novel)|novel of the same name]] and tells the story of [[Virgil Tibbs]], a black police [[detective]] from [[Philadelphia]], who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in [[Mississippi]]. It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Rod Steiger]], and was produced by [[Walter Mirisch]]. The screenplay was by [[Stirling Silliphant]].\n\nThe film won five [[Academy Awards]], including the [[40th Academy Awards|1967]] awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Rod Steiger for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe film was followed by two [[sequel]]s, ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' (1971). It was also the basis of a [[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|1988 television series]] adaptation of the same name.\n\nThe quote \"They call me ''Mister Tibbs!''{{-\"}} was listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!--As per WP:MOS-FILMS, the plot summary must not exceed 700 words-->\nIn 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Sparta, Mississippi]], to build a factory there. Late one night, police officer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body lying in the street.\n\nChief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for a few hours. At the train station, Wood finds a black man, [[Virgil Tibbs]], and arrests him. Gillespie accuses Tibbs of the murder, and is embarrassed to learn Tibbs is a police officer from [[Philadelphia]]. Gillespie phones Tibbs's chief, who informs Gillespie that Tibbs is a top homicide detective and recommends that he should assist the investigation. The idea does not appeal to either Gillespie or Tibbs, but for reasons of their own they reluctantly agree. Tibbs examines Colbert's body and concludes the murder happened earlier than the doctor had estimated, that the killer was right-handed, and that the victim had been killed elsewhere and then moved to where the body was found.\n\nGillespie arrests another suspect, who protests his innocence. The police are planning to beat him into confessing, but Tibbs reveals he is left-handed and has an alibi backed up by witnesses. Colbert's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the police and impressed by Tibbs. She threatens to halt construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation, and the town's leading citizens are forced to go along with her wish. The two policemen begin to respect each other as they are forced to work together.\n\nTibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a genteel racist and one of the most powerful individuals in town, who publicly opposed the new factory. When Tibbs interrogates Endicott, Endicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of thugs after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues Tibbs and tells him to leave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. \n\nTibbs asks Wood to re-trace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them. Tibbs reveals that Wood has changed the route of his patrol. Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder. He starts to suspect Wood and arrests him, despite Tibbs's protests. Purdy, a hostile local, brings his 16-year-old sister Delores to the police station and files charges against Wood for getting her pregnant. Tibbs insists on being present when Delores is questioned. Purdy is offended that a black man was present at his sister's questioning, and gathers a mob to attack Tibbs. Meanwhile, Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood of the murder charge, because he couldn't have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town. Tibbs adds that he knows why Wood changed his route: at night Delores likes to display her naked body to whoever is outside, and Wood, who watches her while on duty, did not want Tibbs to see a white woman in the nude.\n\nTibbs visits a [[Unsafe abortion#Illegal abortion|backstreet abortionist]], who under pressure reveals that she is about to perform an abortion on Delores. Delores arrives, sees Tibbs, and runs away. Tibbs follows her and comes face to face with her armed boyfriend, Ralph, a cook from a local roadside diner. At that moment Purdy's mob arrives on the scene and holds Tibbs at gunpoint. Tibbs shouts at Purdy to check Delores' purse, that it contains money Ralph gave her for an abortion, which he got when he robbed and killed Colbert. Purdy grabs the purse and looks inside, and realizes Tibbs is right. Purdy confronts Ralph for getting his sister pregnant, and a startled Ralph shoots Purdy dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun, and just then Gillespie arrives on the scene. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he had gone to ask Colbert for a job at the new factory, but ended up attacking him and taking his money. \"That's all. I didn't mean to kill him,\" are the final words of Ralph's taped confession.\n\nThe final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie, having carried his suitcase, respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-break}}\n*[[Sidney Poitier]] as [[Virgil Tibbs]]\n*[[Rod Steiger]] as Chief Bill Gillespie\n*[[Warren Oates]] as Sam Wood\n*[[Lee Grant]] as Mrs. Colbert\n*[[Larry Gates]] as Endicott\n*[[James Patterson (actor)|James Patterson]] as Mr. Purdy\n*[[William Schallert]] as Mayor Schubert\n*[[Beah Richards]] as Mama Caleba\n*[[Peter Whitney]] as Courtney\n{{Col-break|gap=2em}}\n*[[Kermit Murdock]] as Henderson\n*[[Larry D.

However, despite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] and [[Union City, Tennessee|Union City]], Tennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta, [[Chester, Illinois|Chester]] (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and [[Freeburg, Illinois|Freeburg]] (Compton's diner), Illinois.\n\nThe famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook ''Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History)'', Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature.\"<ref>Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History), Vivienne Sanders, Hodder Education, 2015</ref> However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] in his book, ''Pictures at a Revolution''. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.\n\nThe film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [[Haskell Wexler]] recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with better photographic results.<ref>Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''.

Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way.\"\n\nA particularly famous line in the film comes immediately after Gillespie mocks the name \"Virgil\" by saying \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?\" An annoyed Tibbs replies, \"They call me ''Mister'' Tibbs!\" This reply was later listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of [[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!|the sequel]].\n\nAnother iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him back. In a [[San Francisco]] pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.<ref>Harris, pp. 288\u201390.</ref> That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, ''[[Superspade|Super-spade]] Versus the Rednecks''.<ref>Harris, p. 336.</ref> During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.<ref>Harris, pp. 335\u20136</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThen-freshman critic [[Roger Ebert]] in 1967 gave ''In the Heat of the Night'' a positive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130707145722/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-10-best-lists-1967-present Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967 to Present.] [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' via the [[Internet Archive]].

Five Oscars include Best Picture&nbsp;...\"\n\n''Mick Martin's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide'' (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\"\n\nBritish references, likewise, show high regard for the film, with [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] in his 1984 ''The Good Film and Video Guide'' giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that \"[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair, but it has enormous tension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates.\"\n\nAnother British film critic with a highly personal ''Film Guide'', [[Leslie Halliwell]], gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway.\" The ''Guide'' continued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, ''Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide 2007'', John Walker, who took over as the ''Guide's'' author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is \"[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting personalities.\"\n\n==Home media==\n''In the Heat of the Night'' was first released on [[DVD]] in 2001. In 2010, the film was digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on [[MGM HD]].\n\nIn 2014, MGM released the film on [[Blu-ray]]. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray from [[The Criterion Collection]] in January 2019.\n\n==Preservation==\nThe [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''In the Heat of the Night'' in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=in+the+heat+of+the+night&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n|-\n|rowspan=7| [[Academy Awards]]<ref name=\"Oscars1968\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1968 |title=The 40th Academy Awards (1968) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-08-25|work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n| [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]\n| [[Walter Mirisch]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n| [[Norman Jewison]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]\n| [[Stirling Silliphant]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n| [[Rod Steiger]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]\n| [[Hal Ashby]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]\n| [[James Richard]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]\n| [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]]s\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[BAFTA Awards]]\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n|\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Foreign Actor]]\n| Rod Steiger\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Sidney Poitier]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| United Nations Award\n| Norman Jewison\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7| [[Golden Globe Awards]]\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]]\n|\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n| Norman Jewison\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]]\n| Rod Steiger\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Sidney Poitier\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]\n| [[Quentin Dean]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Lee Grant]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|rowspan=2| Stirling Silliphant\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Edgar Award]]\n| [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay winners|Best Motion Picture Screenplay]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[New York Film Critics Circle]]\n| [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n| Walter Mirisch\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n| Norman Jewison\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n| Rod Steiger\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Directors Guild of America]]\n| [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Outstanding Directing]]\n| Norman Jewison\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Writers Guild of America]]\n| Best Written American Drama\n| Stirling Silliphant\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Grammy Awards]]\n| [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Quincy Jones]]\n| {{nom}}\n|}\n\n'''[[American Film Institute]] recognition'''\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]]: #75\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]: [[Virgil Tibbs]] #19 Hero\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Virgil Tibbs: \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\": #16\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers]]: # 21\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1967]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0061811}}\n* {{TCMDb title|17602}}\n* {{AllMovie title|24638}}\n* {{AFI film|23257}}\n* {{Mojo title|intheheatofthenight}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|in_the_heat_of_the_night}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6173-in-the-heat-of-the-night-the-double-bind ''In the Heat of the Night: The Double Bind''] an essay by K.

The film tells the story of John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an [[enlarged heart]] and finds out he is unable to receive a [[Organ transplantation|transplant]] because [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] insurance will not cover it, before he decides to hold up the hospital and force them to do it.\n\nThe film co-stars [[Robert Duvall]], [[Kimberly Elise]], [[Anne Heche]], [[James Woods]], and [[Ray Liotta]]. The film was shot in [[Toronto]],<ref name=\"torontoist\">{{cite web|title=Reel Toronto: John Q|url=http://torontoist.com/2009/07/reel_toronto_john_q.php|work=online news|publisher=Torontoist}}</ref> [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Canmore, Alberta]], although the story takes place in [[Chicago]]. Shooting took place for 60 days from August 8 to November 3, 2000. The film was released on February 15, 2002.\n\n== Plot ==\nJohn Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, a hospital administrator,  that Michael has an enlarged heart and will need a [[Organ transplant|transplant]]. Because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his [[health insurance]] has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, leaving them to raise $250,000 to get their son's name on the donor list. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off.\n\nMeanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for. One of them, Miriam, is pregnant, and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy. A young hostage, Julie, has a broken arm, and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it. Due to  holes in their story, John and another hostage, Lester, conclude  the two are lying and that Mitch beat up Julie. After a while, John agrees to release some hostages to have his son's name added to the list an hour afterward. He releases Steve, Miriam, and a hostage named Rosa with her baby.\n\nThe Chicago Chief of Police, Gus Monroe, gives a [[SWAT]] unit permission to insert a sniper into the building via an air shaft. John is shot but ends up receiving only a minor wound, which is treated right away. After taking the shot, the sniper's leg falls through the ceiling tiles. Outraged, John pulls him out of the air shaft and beats him up. Using the bound SWAT policeman as a human shield, he steps outside to the sight of dozens of policemen pointing weapons at him and a large, supportive crowd. John demands that his son be brought to the emergency room. The police agree to his demand in exchange for the SWAT sniper.\n\nOnce his son arrives, John reveals to the hostages his intention to commit suicide so his heart can be used to save his son. He persuades Dr. Turner to perform the operation, and two of his hostages bear witness to a will stating his last request. John says his last good-byes to Michael and enters the operating room. He loads a single bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger, but the safety is on. As he prepares to end his life a second time, his wife learns about an organ donor who has been flown to the hospital for organ recovery. She runs to the emergency room and stops John from shooting himself, and John allows the hostages to go free. Michael is given the life-saving operation and, after watching the procedure with Denise, John is taken into police custody. At his trial, all of the witnesses speak on his behalf. He is later acquitted of charges of [[attempted murder]] and armed criminal action but is found guilty of kidnapping. It is never revealed what his sentence for the crime will be, but his lawyer is overheard saying that no judge will give him \"more than three to five (years)\" and that she will try and get it reduced to two.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as John Quincy Archibald\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Denise Archibald\n* Daniel E.

Mac is [[Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Charlie Kelly]]'s childhood friend and [[Dennis Reynolds]]'s high school friend and later roommate.\n\n==Character overview==\nMac is a co-owner of Paddy's, the self-proclaimed \"Sheriff of Paddy's,\" and is generally the pub's most active manager. Mac is played by [[Rob McElhenney]].\n\nMac frequently uses his signature line, \"What's up, bitches?\" throughout the series. In many episodes, Mac will enter the bar announcing \"I've got news\" or a variation of the phrase, to set the episode's plot in motion. The others rarely share his enthusiasm, but he usually convinces one of them to follow him, though often reluctantly. Throughout the series, Mac uses a \"puppy-dog look\" when he is ashamed or when he proposes something reprehensibly shameful.\n\n==Name==\nFor the first six seasons, Mac's full name was kept anonymous as a running joke, though in the season four episode \"Mac & Charlie Die,\" Mac's father's name is listed as \"Luther Mac\" on his parole papers and his mother is referred to as Mrs. Mac.  In the episode \"Who Got Dee Pregnant?,\" one of the McPoyle brothers refers to Mac as \"Macwell.\" In the episode \"The Gang Cracks the Liberty Bell\" Mac, or at least Mac's 18th Century counterpart, is called \"McDonald,\" suggesting that this is his surname. Mac's full real name, Ronald McDonald, is revealed in the season seven episode \"The High School Reunion\". Mac hates the name due to its connection with [[Ronald McDonald|the spokesman]] of the popular fast food chain [[McDonald's]] as well as his old nickname, \"Ronnie the Rat,\" which he obtained from ratting on fellow drug dealers in high school. Mac \"ratted\" on drug dealers so he could become the main drug dealer of the school. He prefers to be simply called \"Mac\".\n\n==Description==\nMac comes from a [[wikt:broken home|broken home]]; his father has been [[prison|incarcerated]] for dealing [[methamphetamine|meth]] and his mother is extremely [[Apathy|apathetic]] and unemotional. Mac and his mother also own a dog named Poppins, who despite being extremely old and prone to eating poisonous objects appears to be practically indestructible. He sees himself as a [[karate]] expert and total \"badass\". Mac constantly seeks the acceptance of others, especially his parents, but his over-earnest efforts do not endear him to others. Earlier, under the impression that his father would possibly murder him after being paroled, Mac later receives a warm letter from his father, specifically requesting that Mac stay away from him. This letter is written as Mac's father fears that Mac's destructive tendencies could harm him. Dennis notes that the only reason Mac hung out with the popular kids in high school was because he sold them all [[Marijuana|weed]] and even then was considered an \"asshole.\" Though Dennis reigns supreme as selfish and arrogant, Mac has made his fair share of selfish, inconsiderate decisions and observations.\n\nMac is considered by every member of The Gang to be a \"jerk\" and is nearly always the first to start betraying the others, though he does usually stick with Dennis, who is his best friend and has known him longer than anybody in The Gang other than Charlie. Like Dennis, Mac sees himself as superior to the rest of The Gang and often attempts to prove his supremacy. For instance, in an attempt to impress Charlie and Dennis, he makes a series of \"Project Badass\" videotapes that consist of various idiotic stunts [[Here I Go Again|set to music]]. He had a sexual relationship with a pre-op transgender woman named Carmen, for whom he claimed he was just \"putting in time\" as he waited for Carmen's [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgery]].\n\nMac sincerely believes that he is an adept [[martial artist]] with \"cat-like reflexes\" and usually wears sleeveless shirts to draw attention to his physique and exhibit his [[Tattoo|tribal tattoos]]. Despite his apparent fitness, Mac generally focuses his workout time on developing his, as Dennis called them, \"glamor muscles\" and is largely the weakest member in The Gang, behind everyone but Dennis. Despite his enthusiasm towards karate, he is shown to have no real skills in the sport.\n\n===Religion===\nA [[Catholicism|Catholic]], Mac is the only member of The Gang to profess a [[Religious faith#Faith in world religions|religious faith]]. In \"[[The Gang Exploits a Miracle]],\" Mac fears that the Lord will show his wrath if they continue to exploit a water stain in the bar that appears to depict the Virgin Mary. Throughout the series, Mac refuses to wear a condom during sex because, as he explains to Charlie, he went to Catholic school. Though Mac seems to care more about issues such as abortion, [[activism|community activism]], and [[parenting]] than the rest of The Gang, his views on such subjects are invariably twisted, ignorant, or prejudiced and his actions regarding them are always hypocritical and selfish. For instance, after pretending to be adamantly pro-life in order to attract a female activist, Mac later demands that she get an abortion when he thinks she has become pregnant by him. In another instance, Mac discovers that Carmen has married and had the operation to remove her penis. He then belittles Carmen and her husband by quoting the Bible to them and calling them gay; however, he only reacts so because he expected Carmen to call him after the operation so they could date again. Mac constantly drinks [[Ethanol|alcohol]], like the rest of The Gang, and abuses other substances, such as [[poppers]] and [[inhalants|glue]]. In recent seasons, Mac has sometimes expressed [[Anti-Semitism]], from his rant about [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and \"his Jews\" using Facebook and other social media to take over the world in \"The Anti-Social Network\" and, in \"The Gang Group Dates,\" telling a disgusted Frank and Charlie that he wants to make sure any women he might date are not Jewish.\n\n===Sexuality===\nWhile Mac has sexual exploits with various women, including two models in immediate succession (\"America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest\"), a long-running theme on the show is the ambiguity surrounding Mac's sexuality which culminates in him coming out as gay in season 12. In earlier seasons, this is manifested by his obsession with men's physiques and his reactionary religious views on homosexuality. In the final scene of the season 4 episode \"Mac's Banging the Waitress,\" Charlie says to Dennis, \"Do you still get the feeling he wants to bang us? That's what this is all about,\" after Mac tries to demonstrate how \"badass\" he is by falling from the roof onto a pile of mattresses. In the season 9 episode \"Mac Day,\" Charlie says, \"I know we've never said this as a group, but Mac's gay,\" to which the rest of The Gang readily agrees. In Season 10, when Dennis is listing all of the delusions The Gang has about themselves, he tells Mac that \"you think that you're tough, and that you're straight.\" After a pause, Mac retorts \"I AM tough!\" Further, in episode 6 of season 10, \"The Gang Misses the Boat,\" Mac convinces The Gang that he is sleeping with an attractive woman; however, they later discover that he merely paid her with angel dust to pretend they were together. She tells them that he \"couldn't even get it up\" for her.\n\nIn episode 9 of season 11, Mac, while on a Christian cruise, discovers that two other male passengers are gay and sets out to \"convert\" them. The two, however, \"convert\" Mac within minutes. This supposed realization of his repressed homosexuality results in the end of his belief in God. After The Gang is informed by Mac of his new identity, they tell him they've known since the first day they met him and proceed to move on with their self-involved lives. In the season 11 finale, Mac and the rest of The Gang are trapped inside the ship's brig and Mac tries one last time to pray to God to save all of them from imminent death (as the ship has presumably capsized and the room is filling with water). They are released in the nick of time. Mac later explains to The Gang and an insurance claim agent that God does exist and he, Mac, is indeed straight, because his prayer was answered and no loving God \"would make\" him gay. In episode 6 of season 12, the gang uses Mac's altered workout bike as evidence of his homosexuality during a legal arbitration. Mac is forced to admit his sexuality to win the dispute, but the gang expects him to return to the closet after the process is over. However, when given an opportunity to retract his admission, Mac finally decides to embrace his identity. In season 13 episode 10, Mac finally comes out to his father as gay. Despite his father disapproving of his sexuality, Mac is not ashamed by his own father's distaste for finding out he's gay.\n\nIt is implied throughout the show that Mac has feelings for Dennis, whom he tries to kiss on multiple occasions. Mac's potential feelings for Dennis are addressed by Dennis in season 13 during a sexual harassment seminar, in which Dennis tells Mac that \"it's not going to happen\".\n\n==Weight gain==\nAt the start of season 7, Mac has gained at least {{convert|60|lb|kg|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} of fat, which he saw as a step to developing muscle (\"cultivating mass\" in his words) to go from \"a tiny twink to [a] muscle-bound freak.\" In the episode \"How Mac Got Fat,\" he goes into greater detail about his intentions, explaining that earlier, the Gang had decided to replace themselves with avatars to run Paddy's Pub so they could slack off. Mac's avatar was a bodybuilder. When Dee points out that the avatar doesn't look like him because he has more muscle, Mac starts gaining weight in an attempt to become the same size as the bodybuilder. Eventually the Gang drops the avatar plan and everything goes back to normal, but Mac is stuck with his dangerous weight gain. The rest of The Gang agrees he looks unhealthy\u2014Dennis is personally outraged by the sight of his gut\u2014but Mac is indifferent to their opinions despite developing [[diabetes]] as a result of his new eating habits.\n\nThe weight gain was real. Rob McElhenney has stated in interviews that he wanted to make Mac fat as his own way of fighting the trend of actors on TV shows getting more attractive as a show gains success (he specifically talked about ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and how the nerdy lead characters were better-dressed and had trendier hairstyles as the show became a huge hit for CBS), and that it also made sense that Mac would be aging badly thanks to the reckless, selfish, and stupid lifestyle of which he and the rest of the characters are so proud.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Molloy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS423067654120110810|title=Fat Mac: Rob McElhenney Goes Into Graphic Detail About 'Sunny' Weight Gain|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTo gain the weight for Season 7 in the healthiest way possible, McElhenney worked with a nutritionist recommended by professional baseball player [[Chase Utley]] (who had played himself in the Season 6 episode \"[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 6)#ep68|The Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods]]\").<ref>{{cite news|first=Ellen|last=Gray|date=August 8, 2011|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/dnhollywood/Utley-tip-helped-Sunny-star-pack-on-pounds.html|title=Utley tip helped 'Sunny' star pack on pounds|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}</ref> He ate an average of 5,000 calories a day during the weight gain, and lost the weight by returning to his normal eating and workout routines.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Antisemitism in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional bartenders]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\n[[Category:It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Character from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Mac (''It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'')}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #DEDEE2\n| name        = Ronald \"Mac\" McDonald \n| series      = [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]\n| image       = Mac McDonald (cropped).png\n| image_size  = 220px\n| first       = \"[[The Gang Gets Racist]]\" (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Rob McElhenney]]<br>[[Glenn Howerton]]<br>[[Charlie Day]]\n| portrayer   = Rob McElhenney\n| aliases       = Vic Vinegar, Ronnie the Rat\n| occupation  = Co-owner, bouncer, and sheriff of [[Paddy's Pub]], martial arts \"expert\"\n| family      = Luther McDonald (father)<br>Mrs. McDonald (mother)<br>Country Mac (cousin; deceased)<br>Brett (cousin)<br>Poppins (pet dog)<br>Frank Reynolds (adopted father)\n| relatives   =\n| religion    = [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]\n}}\n\n'''Ronald''' \"'''Mac'''\" '''McDonald''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]''.

In her final years, she made a religious tour of [[Syria Palaestina]] and [[Jerusalem]], during which ancient tradition claims that she discovered the [[True Cross]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]] revere her as a [[saint]]; the [[Lutheran Church]] commemorates her.\n\n== Early life ==\nHelena's birthplace is not known with certainty. The 6th-century historian [[Procopius]] is the earliest authority for the statement that Helena was a native [[Greece|Greek]] of [[Helenopolis, Bithynia|Drepanum]], in the province of [[Bithynia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Her son Constantine renamed the city \"[[Helenopolis, Bithynia|Helenopolis]]\" after her death around 330, which supports the belief that the city was indeed her birthplace.<ref name=\"Harbors, 12\">Harbus, 12.</ref> The Byzantinist [[Cyril Mango]] has, however, argued that Helenopolis was refounded to strengthen the communication network around Constantine's new capital in Constantinople, and was renamed simply to honor Helena, not to necessarily mark her birthplace.<ref>Mango, 143\u201358, cited in Harbus, 13.</ref> There was also a [[Helenopolis (Palestine)|Helenopolis in Palestine]]<ref>G\u00fcnter Stemberger, ''Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century'', 2000, p. 9 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=tu7esOXinfkC&pg=PA9 full text]).</ref> and a [[Helenopolis in Lydia]].<ref>Hunt, 49, cited in Harbus, 12.</ref> These cities, and the province of [[Helenopontus]] in the Pontus, were probably all named after Constantine's mother.<ref name=\"Harbors, 12\" />\n\nThe bishop and historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] states that Helena was about 80 on her return from Palestine.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 3.46.</ref> Since that journey has been dated to 326\u201328, she was probably born around 246 to 248. However, little is known of her early life.<ref name=\"Harbus, 13\">Harbus, 13.</ref> Fourth-century sources, following [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]' ''Breviarium,'' record that she came from a humble background. Bishop [[Ambrose]] of Milan, writing in the late 4th century was the first to call her a ''stabularia'', a term translated as \"stable-maid\" or \"inn-keeper\". He makes this fact a virtue, calling Helena a ''bona stabularia'', a \"good stable-maid\".<ref>Ambrose, ''De obitu Theodosii'' 42; Harbus, 13.</ref> Other sources, especially those written after Constantine's proclamation as emperor, gloss over or ignore her background.<ref name=\"Harbus, 13\" />\n\n== Marriage to Emperor Constantius ==\nIt is unknown where she first met [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]].<ref name=\"Lieu and Montserrat, 49\">Lieu and Montserrat, 49.</ref> The historian [[Timothy Barnes]] has suggested that [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]], while serving under Emperor [[Aurelian]], could have met her while stationed in Asia Minor for the campaign against [[Zenobia]]. It is said that upon meeting they were wearing identical silver bracelets; [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] saw her as his soulmate sent by God. Barnes calls attention to an epitaph at [[Nicomedia]] of one of Aurelian's protectors, which could indicate the emperor's presence in the Bithynian region soon after 270.<ref>''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 2776, cited in Barnes, \"New Empire,\" 36.</ref> The precise legal nature of the relationship between Helena and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] is also unknown. The sources are equivocal on the point, sometimes calling Helena [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]]' \"wife\", and sometimes, following the dismissive propaganda of Constantine's rival [[Maxentius]],<ref>Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:126f.:130.</ref> calling her his \"concubine\".<ref name=\"Lieu and Montserrat, 49\" /> [[Jerome]], perhaps confused by the vague terminology of his own sources, manages to do both.<ref>Hieronymus, ''Chronica'', ''s.a.'' 292, p. 226, 4 and ''s.a.'' 306, p. 228, 23/4, cited in Lieu and Montserrat, 49.</ref>\n\nSome scholars, such as the historian Jan Drijvers, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined in a [[common-law marriage]], a cohabitation recognized in fact but not in law.<ref>Drijvers, ''Helena Augusta'', 17\u201319.</ref> Others, like Timothy Barnes, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined in an official marriage, on the grounds that the sources claiming an official marriage are more reliable.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 36.</ref>\n\nHelena gave birth to the future emperor [[Constantine I]] on 27 February of an uncertain year soon after 270<ref>Barnes, ''CE'', 3, 39\u201342; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Odahl, 15; Pohlsander, \"Constantine I\"; Southern, 169, 341.</ref> (probably around 272).<ref>Barnes, ''CE'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39\u201342; Elliott, \"Constantine's Conversion,\" 425\u20136; Elliott, \"Eusebian Frauds,\" 163; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Jones, 13\u201314; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 59; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14; Rodgers, 238; Wright, 495, 507.</ref> At the time, she was in [[Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]).<ref>Barnes, ''CE'', 3.</ref> In order to obtain a wife more consonant with his rising status, Constantius divorced Helena some time before 289, when he married [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]], Maximian's daughter under his command.<ref>Barnes, ''CE'', 8\u20139.</ref> (The narrative sources date the marriage to 293, but the [[Panegyrici Latini|Latin panegyric]] of 289 refers to the couple as already married).<ref>''Origo'' 1; Victor, ''Caes''. 39.24f; Eutropius, ''Brev''. 9.22.1; ''Epitome'' 39.2; ''Pan''.

Helena never remarried and lived for a time in obscurity, though close to her only son, who had a deep regard and affection for her.\n\n[[File:0 Statue de Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne par Andrea Bolgi - Basilique St-Pierre - Vatican.JPG|thumb|Statue of Saint Helena in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]\n\n== After Constantine's ascension to the throne ==\nConstantine was proclaimed [[Augustus (title)#Division of Empire|Augustus]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 306 by Constantius' troops after the latter had died, and following his elevation his mother was brought back to the public life in 312, returning to the imperial court. She appears in the Eagle Cameo portraying Constantine's family, probably commemorating the birth of Constantine's son Constantine II in the summer of 316.{{efn|The cameo was incorporated in the rich binding of the [[Ada Gospels]]; the year 316 is argued in Stephenson 2010:126f.}} She received the title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' in 325.

Local founding legend attributes to Helena's orders the construction of a church in Egypt to identify the [[Burning Bush]] of Sinai. The chapel at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]\u2014often referred to as the Chapel of Saint Helen\u2014is dated to the year AD 330.\n\n=== The \"True Cross\" and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ===\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|''Helena of Constantinople'' by [[Cima da Conegliano]], 1495 ([[National Gallery of Art]], Washington D.C.)]]\n[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - Saint Helena with the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Helena with the Cross'', [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1525 ([[Cincinnati Art Museum]])]]\n\nJerusalem was still being rebuilt following the destruction caused by [[Titus]] in AD 70. Emperor [[Hadrian]] had built during the 130s a temple to Venus over the supposed site of [[Jesus]]'s tomb near [[Calvary]], and renamed the city [[Aelia Capitolina]]. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or Jupiter.<ref>Stephenson 2010:252.</ref> According to Eusebius, \"[t]here was a temple of Venus on the spot. This the queen (Helena) had destroyed.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine''. From Philip Schaff, ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.iii.iv.viii.html]</ref> According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose at the end of the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in [[Ambrose]], ''On the Death of Theodosius'' (died 395) and at length in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'']], the main body of which does not mention the event.{{efn|Noted in Stephenson 2010:253f, who observes \"None of this is true\" noting Rufinus' source in a lost work of [[Gelasius of Caesarea]].}} Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to be swayed by anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered,{{efn|There are actually several different accounts: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Arch\u00e6ology of the Cross and Crucifix]: \"Following an inspiration from on high, [[Macarius of Jerusalem|Macarius]] caused the three crosses to be carried, one after the other, to the bedside of a worthy woman who was at the point of death. The touch of the other two was of no avail; but on touching that upon which Christ had died the woman got suddenly well again. From a letter of St. Paulinus to Severus inserted in the Breviary of Paris it would appear that St. Helena herself had sought by means of a miracle to discover which was the True Cross and that she caused a man already dead and buried to be carried to the spot, whereupon, by contact with the third cross, he came to life.<br />From the 1955 Roman Catholic Marian Missal: St. Helen, the first Christian Empress, went to Jerusalem to try to find the True Cross. She found it in 320 on September 14. In the eighth century, the feast of the Finding was transferred to May 3rd and on Sept. 14 was celebrated the \"Exaltation of the Cross,\" the commemoration of a victory over the Persians by Heraclius, as a result of which the relic was returned to Jerusalem.<br /> From yet another tradition, related by [[St. Ambrose]] following Rufinus, it would seem that the [[Titulus Crucis|titulus]], or inscription, had remained fastened to the Cross.\"; see also [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.iv.xvii.html Socrates' ''Church History'' at CCEL.org: Book I, Chapter XVII: ''The Emperor\u2019s Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church.'']}} and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the [[True Cross]].\n\nOn the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena.\n\nThe \"Letter From Constantine to Macarius of Jerusalem\", as presented in Eusebius' ''Life of Constantine'', states:<br>\n: \"Such is our Saviour's grace, that no power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his [Christ's] most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration. I have no greater care than how I may best adorn with a splendid structure that sacred spot, which, under Divine direction, I have disencumbered as it were of the heavy weight of foul idol worship [the Roman temple]; a spot which has been accounted holy from the beginning in God\u2019s judgment, but which now appears holier still, since it has brought to light a clear assurance of our Saviour\u2019s passion.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine''. From Philip Schaff, ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.xxx.html]</ref>\n\n[[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]] claim that Helena also found the [[Nail (relic)|nails of the crucifixion]]. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse. According to one tradition, Helena acquired the [[Holy Tunic]] on her trip to Jerusalem and sent it to [[Trier]].\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nSeveral relics purportedly discovered by Helena are now in [[Cyprus]], where she spent some time. Among them are items believed to be part of Jesus Christ's tunic, pieces of the holy cross, and pieces of the rope with which Jesus was tied on the Cross. The rope, considered to be the only relic of its kind, has been held at the [[Stavrovouni Monastery]], which was also said to have been founded by Helena. According to tradition, Helena is responsible for the large population of cats in [[Cyprus]]. Local tradition holds that she imported hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine in the fourth century to rid a monastery of snakes. The monastery is today known as \"St. Nicholas of the Cats\" (Greek {{lang|el|\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0393\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd}}) and is located near [[Limassol]].<ref name=\"stnicholas of the cats RoughGuide\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocypr01dubi |title=The Rough Guide To Cyprus |last=Dubin |first=Marc |publisher=Rough Guide |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocypr01dubi/page/135 135\u2013136] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rome ===\nHelena left Jerusalem and the eastern provinces<!-- Eusebius, VC,3, chapter XLIV --> in 327 to return to Rome, bringing with her large parts of the True Cross and other relics, which were then stored in her palace's private chapel, where they can be still seen today. Her palace was later converted into the [[Basilica]] of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme|the Holy Cross in Jerusalem]]. This has been maintained by [[Cistercian]] monks in the [[monastery]] which has been attached to the church for centuries.\n\n== Death and burial ==\nHelena died around 330, with her son at her side. She was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Helena]], outside [[Rome]] on the [[Via Labicana]]. Her [[sarcophagus]] is on display in the [[Museo Pio-Clementino|Pio-Clementine Vatican Museum]], although the connection is often questioned. Next to her is the sarcophagus of her granddaughter [[Constantina]] (Saint Constance). \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Helena tomb.jpg|[[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina|Helena's sarcophagus]] in the Museo Pio-Clementino, [[Vatican Museums]], Rome\n</gallery>\n\n== Sainthood ==\n[[File:Brosen icon constantine helena.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Bulgaria]]n [[icon]] of Saint Constantine and Saint Helena]]\n\nHelena is considered by the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Eastern and Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as by the [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es, as a [[saint]], famed for her piety{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The holiday is usually celebrated with the lighting of a large bonfire, or ''Demera'', based on the belief that she had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the true cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.<ref name=\"walta\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html |title=Walta Information Center |website=Meskel Being Celebrated Across The Nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319160802/http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html |archive-date=March 19, 2006 |access-date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Satue of Saint Helen.jpg|thumb|Baroque statue of \"Santa Liena\" in the 2011 village festa procession of Birkirkara, [[Malta]]]]\n\n==Relics==\nHer alleged skull is displayed in the [[Cathedral of Trier]], in [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Portions of her relics are found at the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]] in [[Rome]], the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles]] in [[Paris]], and at the [[Abbaye Saint-Pierre d'Hautvillers]]. \n\nThe church of [[Sant'Elena]] in [[Venice]] claims to have the complete body of the saint enshrined under the main altar.

The 6th-century historian [[Procopius]] is the earliest authority for the statement that Helena was a native [[Greece|Greek]] of [[Helenopolis, Bithynia|Drepanum]], in the province of [[Bithynia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Her son Constantine renamed the city \"[[Helenopolis, Bithynia|Helenopolis]]\" after her death around 330, which supports the belief that the city was indeed her birthplace.<ref name=\"Harbors, 12\">Harbus, 12.</ref> The Byzantinist [[Cyril Mango]] has, however, argued that Helenopolis was refounded to strengthen the communication network around Constantine's new capital in Constantinople, and was renamed simply to honor Helena, not to necessarily mark her birthplace.<ref>Mango, 143\u201358, cited in Harbus, 13.</ref> There was also a [[Helenopolis (Palestine)|Helenopolis in Palestine]]<ref>G\u00fcnter Stemberger, ''Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century'', 2000, p. 9 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=tu7esOXinfkC&pg=PA9 full text]).</ref> and a [[Helenopolis in Lydia]].<ref>Hunt, 49, cited in Harbus, 12.</ref> These cities, and the province of [[Helenopontus]] in the Pontus, were probably all named after Constantine's mother.<ref name=\"Harbors, 12\" />\n\nThe bishop and historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] states that Helena was about 80 on her return from Palestine.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 3.46.</ref> Since that journey has been dated to 326\u201328, she was probably born around 246 to 248. However, little is known of her early life.<ref name=\"Harbus, 13\">Harbus, 13.</ref> Fourth-century sources, following [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]' ''Breviarium,'' record that she came from a humble background. Bishop [[Ambrose]] of Milan, writing in the late 4th century was the first to call her a ''stabularia'', a term translated as \"stable-maid\" or \"inn-keeper\". He makes this fact a virtue, calling Helena a ''bona stabularia'', a \"good stable-maid\".<ref>Ambrose, ''De obitu Theodosii'' 42; Harbus, 13.</ref> Other sources, especially those written after Constantine's proclamation as emperor, gloss over or ignore her background.<ref name=\"Harbus, 13\" />\n\n== Marriage to Emperor Constantius ==\nIt is unknown where she first met [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]].<ref name=\"Lieu and Montserrat, 49\">Lieu and Montserrat, 49.</ref> The historian [[Timothy Barnes]] has suggested that [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]], while serving under Emperor [[Aurelian]], could have met her while stationed in Asia Minor for the campaign against [[Zenobia]]. It is said that upon meeting they were wearing identical silver bracelets; [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] saw her as his soulmate sent by God. Barnes calls attention to an epitaph at [[Nicomedia]] of one of Aurelian's protectors, which could indicate the emperor's presence in the Bithynian region soon after 270.<ref>''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 2776, cited in Barnes, \"New Empire,\" 36.</ref> The precise legal nature of the relationship between Helena and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] is also unknown.

Local founding legend attributes to Helena's orders the construction of a church in Egypt to identify the [[Burning Bush]] of Sinai. The chapel at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]\u2014often referred to as the Chapel of Saint Helen\u2014is dated to the year AD 330.\n\n=== The \"True Cross\" and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ===\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|''Helena of Constantinople'' by [[Cima da Conegliano]], 1495 ([[National Gallery of Art]], Washington D.C.)]]\n[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - Saint Helena with the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Helena with the Cross'', [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1525 ([[Cincinnati Art Museum]])]]\n\nJerusalem was still being rebuilt following the destruction caused by [[Titus]] in AD 70. Emperor [[Hadrian]] had built during the 130s a temple to Venus over the supposed site of [[Jesus]]'s tomb near [[Calvary]], and renamed the city [[Aelia Capitolina]]. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or Jupiter.<ref>Stephenson 2010:252.</ref> According to Eusebius, \"[t]here was a temple of Venus on the spot. This the queen (Helena) had destroyed.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine''. From Philip Schaff, ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.iii.iv.viii.html]</ref> According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose at the end of the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in [[Ambrose]], ''On the Death of Theodosius'' (died 395) and at length in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'']], the main body of which does not mention the event.{{efn|Noted in Stephenson 2010:253f, who observes \"None of this is true\" noting Rufinus' source in a lost work of [[Gelasius of Caesarea]].}} Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to be swayed by anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered,{{efn|There are actually several different accounts: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Arch\u00e6ology of the Cross and Crucifix]: \"Following an inspiration from on high, [[Macarius of Jerusalem|Macarius]] caused the three crosses to be carried, one after the other, to the bedside of a worthy woman who was at the point of death. The touch of the other two was of no avail; but on touching that upon which Christ had died the woman got suddenly well again. From a letter of St. Paulinus to Severus inserted in the Breviary of Paris it would appear that St. Helena herself had sought by means of a miracle to discover which was the True Cross and that she caused a man already dead and buried to be carried to the spot, whereupon, by contact with the third cross, he came to life.<br />From the 1955 Roman Catholic Marian Missal: St. Helen, the first Christian Empress, went to Jerusalem to try to find the True Cross. She found it in 320 on September 14. In the eighth century, the feast of the Finding was transferred to May 3rd and on Sept. 14 was celebrated the \"Exaltation of the Cross,\" the commemoration of a victory over the Persians by Heraclius, as a result of which the relic was returned to Jerusalem.<br /> From yet another tradition, related by [[St. Ambrose]] following Rufinus, it would seem that the [[Titulus Crucis|titulus]], or inscription, had remained fastened to the Cross.\"; see also [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.iv.xvii.html Socrates' ''Church History'' at CCEL.org: Book I, Chapter XVII: ''The Emperor\u2019s Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church.'']}} and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the [[True Cross]].\n\nOn the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena.\n\nThe \"Letter From Constantine to Macarius of Jerusalem\", as presented in Eusebius' ''Life of Constantine'', states:<br>\n: \"Such is our Saviour's grace, that no power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his [Christ's] most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration. I have no greater care than how I may best adorn with a splendid structure that sacred spot, which, under Divine direction, I have disencumbered as it were of the heavy weight of foul idol worship [the Roman temple]; a spot which has been accounted holy from the beginning in God\u2019s judgment, but which now appears holier still, since it has brought to light a clear assurance of our Saviour\u2019s passion.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine''. From Philip Schaff, ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.xxx.html]</ref>\n\n[[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]] claim that Helena also found the [[Nail (relic)|nails of the crucifixion]]. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse. According to one tradition, Helena acquired the [[Holy Tunic]] on her trip to Jerusalem and sent it to [[Trier]].\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nSeveral relics purportedly discovered by Helena are now in [[Cyprus]], where she spent some time. Among them are items believed to be part of Jesus Christ's tunic, pieces of the holy cross, and pieces of the rope with which Jesus was tied on the Cross. The rope, considered to be the only relic of its kind, has been held at the [[Stavrovouni Monastery]], which was also said to have been founded by Helena. According to tradition, Helena is responsible for the large population of cats in [[Cyprus]]. Local tradition holds that she imported hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine in the fourth century to rid a monastery of snakes. The monastery is today known as \"St. Nicholas of the Cats\" (Greek {{lang|el|\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0393\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd}}) and is located near [[Limassol]].<ref name=\"stnicholas of the cats RoughGuide\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocypr01dubi |title=The Rough Guide To Cyprus |last=Dubin |first=Marc |publisher=Rough Guide |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocypr01dubi/page/135 135\u2013136] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rome ===\nHelena left Jerusalem and the eastern provinces<!-- Eusebius, VC,3, chapter XLIV --> in 327 to return to Rome, bringing with her large parts of the True Cross and other relics, which were then stored in her palace's private chapel, where they can be still seen today. Her palace was later converted into the [[Basilica]] of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme|the Holy Cross in Jerusalem]]. This has been maintained by [[Cistercian]] monks in the [[monastery]] which has been attached to the church for centuries.\n\n== Death and burial ==\nHelena died around 330, with her son at her side. She was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Helena]], outside [[Rome]] on the [[Via Labicana]]. Her [[sarcophagus]] is on display in the [[Museo Pio-Clementino|Pio-Clementine Vatican Museum]], although the connection is often questioned.

The holiday is usually celebrated with the lighting of a large bonfire, or ''Demera'', based on the belief that she had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the true cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.<ref name=\"walta\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html |title=Walta Information Center |website=Meskel Being Celebrated Across The Nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319160802/http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html |archive-date=March 19, 2006 |access-date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Satue of Saint Helen.jpg|thumb|Baroque statue of \"Santa Liena\" in the 2011 village festa procession of Birkirkara, [[Malta]]]]\n\n==Relics==\nHer alleged skull is displayed in the [[Cathedral of Trier]], in [[Germany]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Harbus, ''Helen of Britain in Medieval Legend'', 2002.}} Geoffrey further states that she was brought up in the manner of a queen, as she had no brothers to inherit the throne of Britain.

It may arise from the similarly named Welsh princess [[Saint Helen of Caernarfon|Saint Elen]] (alleged to have married [[Magnus Maximus]] and to have borne a son named Constantine) or from the misinterpretation of a term used in the fourth chapter of the panegyric on Constantine's marriage with Fausta.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.
