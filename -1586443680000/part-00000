And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming. [horse whinnies] It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep. [crows caw] For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [gasps] What? - Princess... Fiona? - No! [sighs relief] Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? [ Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love] So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on - [screams] - Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on We were once upon a time in love Hyah!

[Donkey sings] - Two can be as bad as one... - Donkey? Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. [chuckles] And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? - Yeah, and feeding the fish! - I don't have any fish. You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your... Look at the time. I guess you'd better be going. Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I'd move in with you. You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey. But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. Say no more. You don't have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. - Donkey! - Yes, roomie? You're bothering me. Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something. He'll be fine. Now, where were we? [giggles] Oh. I think I remember. - Donkey! - [Fiona yelps] I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm going. What do you want me to tell these other guys? [fanfare] [ theme to Hawaii Five-O] Enough, Reggie. [clears throat] \"Dearest Princess Fiona. \"You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away \"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage \"at which time the King \"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your...\" uh...\"Prince Charming. \"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. \"aka Mom and Dad.\" Mom and Dad? - Prince Charming? - Royal ball? Can I come? - We're not going. - [both] What? I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this? [chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too. Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club. Stop it. They're not like that. How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? No! They just want to give you their blessing. Oh, great. Now I need their blessing? If you want to be a part of this family, yes! Who says I want to be part of this family? You did! When you married me! Well, there's some fine print for you! [exasperated sigh] So that's it. You won't come? Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final! Come on! We don't want to hit traffic! [Gingy] Don't worry! We'll take care of everything. [all cheer] - Hey, wait for me. Oof! - [glass breaks] [sighs] [ Chic: Le Freak] Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw! - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] No. - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Fiona] Not yet. - [Donkey] OK, are we there yet? - [Fiona] No. - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] No! - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] Yes. - Really? - No! - Are we there yet? - [Fiona] No! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek] We are not! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek & Fiona] No! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek mimics] - That's not funny. That's really immature. - [Shrek mimics] - This is why nobody likes ogres. - [Shrek mimics] - Your loss! - [Shrek mimics] - I'm gonna just stop talking. - Finally! This is taking forever, Shrek. There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. Far, far... [softly] away! All right, all right, I get it. I'm just so darn bored. Well, find a way to entertain yourself. [sighs] [deep sigh] [clicks tongue] [popping] - [popping] - [exasperated sigh] For five minutes... Could you not be yourself... [shouts]... for five minutes! - [popping] - [shrieks] Are we there yet? - [chuckles] Yes! - Oh, finally! [fanfare] [ Lipps, Inc: Funkytown] Wow!

Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me We are definitely not in the swamp anymore. [whistle] Halt! Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it Hey, everyone, look. Talk about, talk about movin'... Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? You working that hat. [Donkey] Swimming pools! Movie stars! [cheering] [applause] [fanfare] Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. Well, this is it. - This is it. - This is it. This is it. [fanfare] [fanfare and cheering stop] [gasps] [tweeting] [baby wails] Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? I'll park the car. [chuckles] So... you still think this was a good idea? Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us. - [softly] Who on earth are they? - [softly] I think that's our little girl. That's not little! That's a really big problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look... [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let's go before they light the torches. - They're my parents. - Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it. Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be... A disaster! There is no way... - You can do this. - I really... - Really... - don't... want... to... be... Here! Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. Well, um... It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from. [chuckles nervously] [gulps] [belches] - Excuse me. - [Shrek & Fiona laugh] Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona? [both giggle] [Shrek] That's good. I guess not. What do you mean, \"not on the list\"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What do you mean, \"not on the list\"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What's happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. - I had the hardest time finding this place. - No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right. He's with us. - He helped rescue me from the dragon. - That's me: the noble steed. Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy. [slurps] - Um, Shrek? - Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm! No, no. Darling. [chuckles nervously] Oh! So, Fiona, tell us about where you live. Well... Shrek owns his own land. - Don't you, honey? - Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and... [laughing] What? I know you ain't talking about the swamp. An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. - [splutters] - [chokes] It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it? - Indeed. I just started eating. - Harold! - What's that supposed to mean? - Dad. It's great, OK? - For his type, yes. - My type? I got to go to the bathroom. - Dinner is served! - Never mind. I can hold it. Bon appetit! Oh, Mexican food! My favorite. Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in. Don't mind if I do, Lillian. I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't eat your own young! Dad! No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower! - Shrek, please! - I only did that because I love her. Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. You wouldn't understand. You're not her father! It's so nice to have the family together for dinner. - Harold! - Shrek! - Fiona! - Fiona! - Mom! - Harold... Donkey! [glissando] Your fallen tears have called to me So, here comes my sweet remedy I know what every princess needs For her to live life happily... [both gasp] Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You're all grown up. - Who are you? - Oh, sweet pea! I'm your fairy godmother. - I have a fairy godmother? - Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. I'm here to make it all better. With just a... Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You'll land a prince with a ton of cash A high-priced dress made by mice no less Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse Confide in your very own furniture friends We'll help you set a new fashion trend - I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great - The kind of girl a prince would date!

Nip and tuck, here and there To land that prince with the perfect hair Stop! [chuckles] Look... Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this. [gasps and mutterings of disapproval] - Fine. Be that way. - We didn't like you, anyway. - [knocking] - [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona? [dog barks] Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... Fairy Godmother, furniture... [giggles] I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? Shrek is the one who rescued me. - But that can't be right. - Oh, great, more relatives! She's just trying to help. Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. - What? - I don't want to leave. When did you decide this? - Shortly after arriving. - Look, I'm sorry... No, that's all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear. If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away. Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy... [laughs] So I see. Let's go, Kyle. - Very nice, Shrek. - What? I told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried to get along with my father. I don't think I was going to get Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it. Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted? Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? You're unbelievable! You're behaving like a... - Go on! Say it! - Like an ogre! Here's a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not... I am an ogre! - [yelps] - [roars] And guess what, Princess? That's not about to change. I've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. That's real smooth, Shrek. \"I'm an ogre!\" [mimics Shrek roaring] [sniffling] I knew this would happen. [Lillian] You should. You started it. I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona's choice. But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you if you don't. I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don't you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... - they were in bloom... - Our first kiss. It's not the same! I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all wonderful! I'd like to know how it could get any worse! - Hello, Harold. - [gasps] - What happened? - Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! [chuckles] I'll just stretch it out here for a while. You better get in. We need to talk. Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. [yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new? You remember my son, Prince Charming? Is that you? My gosh! It's been years. When did you get back? Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert... I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... Mommy can handle this. He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. It wasn't my fault. He didn't get there in time. Stop the car! [crash] Harold. You force me to do something I really don't want to do. [gasps] Where are we? Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May I take your order? My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... - I'll have the Medieval Meal. - One Medieval Meal and, Harold... - Curly fries? - No, thank you. - Sourdough soft taco, then? - No, really, I'm fine. Your order, Fairy Godmother. This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part. [sighs deeply] Indeed not. So, Fiona and Charming will be together. - Yes. - Believe me, Harold. It's what's best. Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom. What am I supposed to do about it? Use your imagination. [whooshing] [whinnies] Oh... Come on in, Your Majesty. [piano plays, people talk] I like my town With a little drop of poison Nobody knows... [barman belches] [clears throat] Excuse me. Do I know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. - Who's the guy? - Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. [crowd gasp] Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could I find him? [knock on door] Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre. [ Eels: I Need Some Sleep] [snoring] [chimes] Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. [plays tune] Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. [echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming. [knock on door] Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... - I don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, I just... - Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona. [sighs] Shall we say, : by the old oak? [birds twitter] [Shrek] Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. \"Head to the darkest part of the woods...\" \"Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches.\" - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to help. I know! I know. - I'm sorry, all right? - Hey, don't worry about it. I just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy. [purring] [purring] Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? I ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! [hisses] Look! A little cat. - Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - It's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. - [screaming] - Whoa! - Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming! - Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! - Look out, Shrek! Hold still! - Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! - Did I miss? - No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! I'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha! [coughs] [wheezes] [retches] [coughs] - [chuckles] Hairball. - Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Se\u00f1or. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? S\u00ed. [screams] Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like I wouldn't change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... \"Happiness.\" \"A tear drop away.\" Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going \"Pi\u00f1ata!!\" What is a pi\u00f1ata, anyway? No, Donkey! I need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. I know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a \"happy ever after.\" Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! - Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? - Shrek! - Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. - Let's keep him! - Say what? [purrs] Ahh! Listen. He's purring! - Oh, so now it's cute. - Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! [giggles] Shrek! [barks] [barks] Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine. [sighs] Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. - Oh, hello, dear. - What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? I haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can I help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. - Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. Maybe you should do the same. [both whisper] No, really? [both laugh] [Shrek] Shh... Oh... [hooter blasts] Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell! [Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter] [Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh. Hi. I'm here to see the... The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry. She is not in. Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now! [sighs] Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK? That's OK, buddy. We're from the union. The union? We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. Oh! Oh, right. Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed? Uh... a little. We don't even have dental. They don't even have dental. Okay, we'll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. - Know what I'm saying? Huh? - Huh? Huh? Huh? - Stop it. - Of course. Go right in. [voices and grinding machines] [explosion] A drop of desire. [giggles] Naughty! A pinch of passion. [laughs] And just a hint of... lust! [laughs] - [Shrek] Excuse me. - [gasps] Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name are you doing here? Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question as to why that is? Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. \"Lived happily ever after.\" Oh... [laughs] No ogres! Let's see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don't live happily ever after. All right, look, lady! Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry. Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. Just... go. Come on, guys. [whistles tune] TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses. - Well, one of these has got to help. - I was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top? No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Shrek, are you off your nut? Donkey, keep watch. Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch. I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be giggling to myself. - What do you see? - Toad Stool Softener? I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. - Elfa Seltzer? - Uh-uh. - Hex Lax? - No! Try \"handsome.\" Sorry. No handsome. Hey! How about \"Happily Ever After\"?

Just get this place cleaned up! And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate! - Mother! - Charming. Sweetheart. This isn't a good time, pumpkin. Mama's working. Whoa, what happened here? - The ogre, that's what! - What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! Oh, put it away, Junior! You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up with something smarter. Pardon. Um... Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? Oh... I do believe we can make this work to our advantage. \"Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. \"For you and your true love. \"If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. \"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine.\" - You both will be fine? - I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here. It says, \"Beauty Divine.\" How bad can it be? [sneezes] See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. And if you think that I'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. Oh, no, no. I don't think so. If there'll be any animal testing, I'll do it. That's the best friend's job. Now give me that bottle. How do you feel? I don't feel any different. I look any different? You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. - Well, here's to us, Fiona. - Shrek? - You drink that, there's no going back. - I know. - No more wallowing in the mud? - I know. - No more itchy butt crack? - I know! - But you love being an ogre! - I know! But I love Fiona more. Shrek, no! Wait! [gurgling] [farts] Got to be... I think you grabbed the \"Farty Ever After\" potion. Maybe it's a dud. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. [thunder rumbles] Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I feel something coming on. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I'm melting! I'm melting! It's just the rain, Donkey. [chuckles] Oh. Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you. [hisses] lt'll be better in the morning. You'll see... The sun'll come out... Tomorrow [yawns] Bet your bottom... Bet my bottom? I'm coming, Elizabeth! Donkey? Are you all right? - Hey, boss. Let's shave him. - D-Donkey? [groans] [Puss In Boots shrieks] There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? Dad... I've been thinking about what you said. And I'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! That's my girl. It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong. [Lillian] Fiona, please! Let's not be rash, darling. You can't go anywhere right now. [rain patters] [Both] Fiona! Look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Quiet. Look at him. [Shrek groans] Good morning, sleepyhead. [Shrek shouts] [All] Good morning!

I'll be your true love! - I'll be your true love. I'll be true... enough. Look, ladies, I already have a true love. [all] Oh... And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. And let's face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. Inside you're the same old mean, salty... - Easy. ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. And you're still the same annoying donkey. - Yeah. - [sighs] Well... Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. First things first. - We need to get you out of those clothes. - [all gasp] - Ready? - Ready! - [Donkey screams] - Driver, stop! Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again? You poor creature! Is there anything I can do for you? Well, I guess there is one thing. Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers. - Not bad. - Not bad at all. [both laugh] Father? Is everything all right, Father? Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you.

Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. Still don't know what I was looking for And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets Every time I thought I'd got it made It seemed the taste was not so sweet - [screams] - Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange - Shrek? - Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Time may change me But I can't trace time Fiona? Hello, handsome. Shrek! - Princess! - Donkey? Wow! That potion worked on you, too? What potion? Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well... Now, we're sexy! Shrek? [purrs] For you, baby... I could be. - Yeah, you wish. - Donkey, where is Shrek? He went inside looking for you. Shrek? Fiona! Fiona! You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? Shrek? Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened to your voice? The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you. Fiona? - Charming? - Do you think so? [laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve. - Um... Who are you? - Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think? [Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! - Fiona! - Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon. [sighs deeply] Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? I just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She's finally found the prince of her dreams. But look at me. Look what I've done for her. It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and you're an ogre. That's something no amount of potion will ever change. But... I love her. If you really love her... you'll let her go. [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] Shrek? Se\u00f1or. What's going on? Where are you going? You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? People just ain't no good I think that's well understood There you go, boys. Just leave the bottle, Doris. Hey. Why the long face? It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. I hate Mondays. I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. Come on. Is he really that good-looking? Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. - Oh. He sounds dreamy. - You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better. Look, guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of. Everybody wins. Except for you. I don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. Aye. And that's why I have to let her go. Excuse me, is she here? She's, uh... in the back. Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. - FYI, not my fault. - No, of course it's not, dear. I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre? No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? - [both] What? - You can't force someone to fall in love! I beg to differ. I do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. - Umm... no. - What did you say? I can't. I won't do it. Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it? - No. - Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming's hair before the ball. He's hopeless. He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother. [Donkey] Mother? Um...

We'll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages. I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture! I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona. Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left! - Tonight on \"Knights\"... - Now here's a good show! We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup. It's time to teach these madcap mammals their \"devil may mare\" attitudes just won't fly. Why you grabbing me? Police brutality! I have to talk to Princess Fiona! - We warned you! - Ow! Ow! Did someone let the cat out of the bag? You capitalist pig dogs! [shrieks] - Catnip! - That's not mine. Find Princess Fiona! I'm a donkey! Tell her Shrek... I'm her husband, Shrek! Quick! Rewind it! I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow! [knock on door] Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball? I'm not going. The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. There's just one problem. That's not my husband. I mean, look at him. Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You'd be surprised how much I changed for your mother. Change? He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. But it's the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. Otherwise I'm up all night. Thanks. I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You're supposed to say I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent! You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad. Shrek? Donkey? Too late. Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! Oh... [ Theme from Mission Impossible] Fire in ze hole! [explosion, rumbling] Look out below! Quick! Tell a lie! - What should I say? - Anything, but quick! Say something crazy like \"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!\" I am wearing ladies' underwear. - Are you? - I most certainly am not! It looks like you most certainly am are! - I am not! - What kind? - It's a thong! - Oww! They're briefs! - Are not. - Are too! - Are not! - Are too! Here we go. Hang tight. [Donkey] Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow! - Excuse me? - What? Puss! Pardon me, would you mind letting me go? - Sorry, boss. - Quit messing around! We've got to stop that kiss! I thought you was going to let her go. I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona. Boom! That's what I like to hear. Look who's coming around! It's impossible! We'll never get in. The castle's guarded. There's a moat and everything! Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. - What? - Do you still know the Muffin Man? Well, sure! He's down on Drury Lane. Why? Because we're gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour. Gingy! Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill! [evil chuckle] [Gingy] It's alive!

Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek. [applause, cheering] Shrek, what are you doing? I'm just playing the part, Fiona. Is that glitter on your lips? Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste? - Ugh! What is with you? - But, Muffin Cake... [piano plays] C Minor, put it in C Minor. Ladies and gentlemen. [applause, cheering] I'd like to dedicate this song to...

Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds? Since when do you dance? Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises.

Ogres don't live happily ever after. [screams] Woo! Ha! [breathes deeply] [gasping] Oh, Dad! [sobbing] - Is he...? - Yup. [croaking] He croaked. Harold? Dad? I'd hoped you'd never see me like this. - And he gave you a hard time! - Donkey! No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now... she already has it. Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing? Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve. You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all. [ribbits] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever? - What? - Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. You'd do that? - For me? - Yes. I want what any princess wants.

Beginning in January 2012,  participating school districts will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator's official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities.

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Act 511 Tax Report |year=2004}}</ref> When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steb.state.pa.us/aboutusmain.asp |title=State Tax Equalization Board About US |author=State Tax Equalization Board |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000816/http://www.steb.state.pa.us/aboutusmain.asp |archivedate=2012-11-14 }}</ref> In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/reports/performance/special/spesteb021011.pdf |title=A Special Performance Audit of the Pennsylvania State Tax Equalization Boards |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General office - Bureau of Audits |date=February 2011}}</ref>\n*2011-12 - 96.4012 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref> \n*2010-11 - 92.3250 mills <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2010}}</ref>\n*2009-10 - 115.3000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports |year=2010}}</ref>\n*2008-09 - 110.3000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills |year=2009}}</ref>\n*2007-08 - 104.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008}}</ref>\n*2006-07 - 99.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2006}}</ref>\n*2005-06 - 94.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n====Act 1 Adjusted Index====\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Bellwood-Antis School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006-2007 through 2010-2011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006-07 - 5.5%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4%\n*2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012-13 budget year, Bellwood-Antis School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index.

Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.<ref>Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, |June 30, 2012</ref> The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Tonyhallagh was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687.\n\nIn the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] Talbot's lands in Tonyhallagh were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'' and the tenant as ''Gilleesaog O'Rely'', who also appear as proprietor and tenant for several other Templeport townlands. In the same survey Blackforde is also listed as the proprietor of ''Rosstawny''. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Tonyhallagh alias Townehuck''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

There are only minor roads and rural lanes within the townland.\n\nThe townland covers 38 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of ''Killcloggin'' (now the modern townland of [[Killycluggin]]).<ref>National Archives Dublin: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf]</ref> <ref>\n[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Tonyhullagh'' and the subdivision as ''Rosstawny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Tonycullagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Tonycula''.\n\nAnother name for the townland was Rostonimore ({{Irish derived place name|Ros Tonnaigh M\u00f3r, meaning 'The Wood of the Big Pasture'}}) \n\nIn the [[D\u00fachas]] Schools' Collection, a story by Francis Maguire describes local legends about Tonyhallagh at http://www.duchas.ie/en/cbes/5044789/5038323\n\nIn the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''one poll of Tawnihulch containing 50 acres at an annual rent of \u00a30-10s-8d to Cahill McBrien O'Reily, gentleman''. \n\nCathal O'Reilly then sold the land to Walter Talbot of [[Ballyconnell]].  \n\nAn Inquisition held at [[Cavan]] Town on 14 March 1630 found that Walter Talbot died on 26 June 1625 at Ballyconnell and his son James Talbot succeeded to, inter alia, ''one poll in Tonenelwlagh'', aged just 10 years. James Talbot married Helen Calvert, the daughter of [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] of [[Maryland]], USA, in 1635 and had a son Colonel George Talbot who owned an estate in [[Cecil County, Maryland]] which he named Ballyconnell in honour of his native town in Cavan. George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 James Talbot's estate in Tonyhallagh was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687.\n\nIn the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] Talbot's lands in Tonyhallagh were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'' and the tenant as ''Gilleesaog O'Rely'', who also appear as proprietor and tenant for several other Templeport townlands. In the same survey Blackforde is also listed as the proprietor of ''Rosstawny''. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Tonyhallagh alias Townehuck''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727. The Blachford family gravestones in Templeport Church read as follows- ''This monument was erected by MAJOR WILLIAM / BLASHFORD of Lisnover in 1721 to the memory of / his father, JOHN BLASHFORD, late of the same Esqr. but / from Dorchester in Dorsetshire, the place of his / nativity, who in his lifetime chose this for a burying / place, for himself and family, but died in Dublin / was buried in St. Orvins Church but his wife, MARY / RENALD of a Devonsheire family is buried here / as also three sons and two daughters, viz JOHN / AMBROSE AND THOMAS; MARY AND FRANCES / Here likewise lies buried two wives of MAJOR WILLIAM BLASHFORD, son to the said JOHN BLASHFORD viz / MARY MAGHEE of an ancient Family in Lincolnsheire.

The system never progressed beyond the pilot schemes installed on the [[Great Western Main Line]] between [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]], and the [[Chiltern Main Line]] from [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] to [[High Wycombe railway station|High Wycombe]] and [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 1980s, an increase in [[signal passed at danger|trains passing signals at danger]] caused [[British Rail]] (BR) to develop a more comprehensive system than the existing [[Automatic Warning System]] (AWS). In 1988, a three-year program was launched to develop a system available to be implemented by 1992. Unlike the existing AWS system, which only advised the driver, leaving room for human error, Automatic Train Protection (ATP) would be able to take control of the train, ensuring it was driven according to the conditions {{harv|Gourvish|2002|pp=355\u2013356}}.\n\nThe two pilot schemes for the project were [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]], and [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] to [[High Wycombe railway station|High Wycombe]] and [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] {{harv|Nguyen|2012}}. As a pilot scheme, the two systems were slightly different, with the Western scheme using [[Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi|ACEC]] equipment, and Chiltern using [[General Electric Company|GEC General Signal]] {{harv|Gourvish|2002|p=356}}.\n\nThere were plans to expand the system more widely, with BR stating that ATP would be installed on \"a large percentage of its network\" {{harv|Hamer|1995}}.  [[Railtrack]], who took over the management of rail infrastructure in 1994, later committed only to completion of the two pilot schemes, adaptation for new high speed lines, and to search for a cheaper alternative for the rest of the network {{harv|Gourvish|2002|p=358}}.\n\nIt was later decided that [[Train Protection & Warning System|TPWS]] would be rolled out instead of ATP {{harv|Watts|1997}}. This system automatically stops trains that pass red signals or speed restrictions at too high a speed, but does not monitor speed constantly, hence only mitigating SPADs, rather than preventing them {{harv|RSSB|2015|p=10}}.\n\nThe total cost of ATP was estimated to be \u00a3750&nbsp;million, equivalent to \u00a31.131&nbsp;billion in 2020 {{harv|Hamer|1995}}. In 1994 British Rail and Railtrack estimated that this would come to \u00a314&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{inflation|UK-GDP|14|1994}} million today) per life saved, compared to the \u00a34&nbsp;million per life they considered good value for money {{harv|Hamer|1995}}. A [[Health and Safety Commission]] report later estimated a full installation of ATP would cost \u00a311&nbsp;million per life saved, or \u00a35&nbsp;million if only installed at high risk locations, figures Railtrack agreed with {{harv|Hamer|1995}}.\n\n== Function ==\nThe aim of ATP was to prevent trains from both exceeding speed restrictions, and from [[signal passed at danger|passing signals at danger]] {{harv|Nguyen|2012|p=3}}.  The system was beacon based, with information transmitted to the train at fixed beacons. The on board computer takes track and signal information from the beacons, and calculates the maximum speed of the train {{harv|Network Rail|2019|p=24}}. When the maximum permitted speed decreases, such as when approaching a signal at danger, three braking curves are calculated: the indication curve, which is the ideal deceleration to the new limit; the warning curve, {{convert|3|mph}} above the indication curve, which causes a warning to the driver; and the intervention curve, {{convert|6|mph}} above the indication curve. At this point, the train will apply the brakes automatically {{harv|Nguyen|2012|p=6}}.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- *{{cite news |last1=BBC News |title=How the safety systems work |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/941526.stm |accessdate=8 March 2020 |date=28 September 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308131530/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/941526.stm |archivedate=8 March 2020}}\n -->\n*{{cite journal |last1=Burrage |first1=K.W. |title=Automatic Train Protection on British Rail: Present Plans and Future Possibilities |journal=Transportation Research Record |date=1990 |volume=1314 |pages=10\u201314 |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/trr/1991/1314/1314-003.pdf |accessdate=8 March 2020|ref=harv|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Gourvish |first1=Terry |title=British Rail 1974\u201397: From Integration to Privatisation |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-925005-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Hamer |first1=Mick |title=Safety signals set at danger |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719862-100-safety-signals-set-at-danger/ |accessdate=8 March 2020 |work=New Scientist |issue=1986 |date=15 July 1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308132754/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719862-100-safety-signals-set-at-danger/ |archivedate=8 March 2020|ref=harv|url-status=live}}\n*{{Cite Hansard|last1=Watts|first1=John|house=House of Commons |title= Automatic Train Protector System|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1997-03-11/debates/d600834b-773c-43f9-a6ca-04bc7c93f871/AutomaticTrainProtectorSystem|date=11 March 1997|volume=292|column_start=143|column_end=144|ref=harv|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |last1=Network Rail |title=Western Route Train Protection 0 to 12mp \u2013 Railway Safety Regulations 1999 Exemption Application Report |url=https://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/41384/western-route-train-protection-0-12mp-railway-safety-regulations-1999-exemption-application-report.pdf |accessdate=8 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308142221/https://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/41384/western-route-train-protection-0-12mp-railway-safety-regulations-1999-exemption-application-report.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2020 |date=21 June 2019 |url-status=live|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |last1=Nguyen |first1=Hoang Nga |title=The BR ATP System |url=http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csmarkus/ProcessesAndData/Slides/Railway_Seminar_Talk10.pdf |publisher=Department of Computer Science, Swansea University |accessdate=8 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308125814/http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csmarkus/ProcessesAndData/Slides/Railway_Seminar_Talk10.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2020 |date=February 2012 |url-status=live|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |last1=RSSB |title=AWS and TPWS Handbook: RS/522 Issue 3  December 2015 |url=https://catalogues.rssb.co.uk/rgs/rulebooks/RS522%20Iss%203.pdf |accessdate=8 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308153205/https://catalogues.rssb.co.uk/rgs/rulebooks/RS522%20Iss%203.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2020 |date=December 2015 |url-status=live|ref=harv}}\n{{Railway signalling}}\n\n[[Category:Train protection systems]]\n[[Category:British Rail research and development]]\n", "text_old": "{{use british english|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=March 2020}}\n{{short description|Railway cab signalling system}}\n<!--\n****\nThis article uses harvard referencing\nPlease plate citation templates in the references section, with ref=harv\nthen harv templates in text\n****\n-->\n{{hatnote|This page is about British Rail's implementation of ATP; For generic train protection systems see [[Automatic train protection]]}}\n'''Automatic Train Protection''' was a method of beacon based [[cab signalling]] developed by [[British Rail]].

''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J. Forster, I.N. Oka, O.D. Sholes, and R.J. Whitman. (1973).

It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E.

Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues.

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, it was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts was the main philosophical difference that resulted in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio, while the different choices of others yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> As an example, one agricultural scientist wrote: \u201cAn interested reader will ask why considering [sic} only the energy used to produce the cement for the processing factory, why not the energy used for the material used to produce the cement, why not the energy used to produce the material used to produce the cement, why not \u2026?

The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics. ''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J. Forster, I.N. Oka, O.D. Sholes, and R.J. Whitman. (1973). Food production and the energy crisis. ''Science'' '''182''': 443-449.</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.)

Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues. That paper then putatively created the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>[Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, it was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts was the main philosophical difference that resulted in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio, while the different choices of others yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> As an example, one agricultural scientist wrote: \u201cAn interested reader will ask why considering [sic} only the energy used to produce the cement for the processing factory, why not the energy used for the material used to produce the cement, why not the energy used to produce the material used to produce the cement, why not \u2026? Accounting for the energy used to produce inputs used results in an infinite accounting sequence and hence an infinite amount of energy as input being used and, hence an infinite amount of production costs\"<ref>Wesseler.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg Graduate School of Management.'' The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory. Even before the Kellogg gift, the school had been expanding its research-focused faculty: In 1978 alone, the school added six additional \"named\" professorships and two new research professorships.<ref name=\"Cent\"/>\n\nIn 2001, in an effort to improve the school's image, its name was shortened to the ''Kellogg School of Management''.<ref name=\"Cent\">{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111051745/http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|archive-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history (2009 - today) ===\nIn June 2009, Kellogg announced that [[Dipak C.

Later in 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building at the northeast corner of its Evanston campus to serve as Kellogg's new home. The new facility, called the Global Hub, opened in March 2017 adjacent to Lake Michigan and includes classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces, and administrative offices. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/about/global-hub.aspx|title=Global Hub \u2013 Kellogg School of Management \u2013 Northwestern|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://menlocoaching.com/kellogg-global-hub/|title=Assistant Dean Kate Smith on Kellogg's Global Hub|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Kellogg announced that [[Sally Blount]] would replace Sunil Chopra as dean, starting in July.

In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

Students spend their first year in law school where they study the standard curriculum. During the first summer and second-year, students study entirely at Kellogg. The second summer students choose to devote their time to either law or business entirely.

Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.\n\n====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====\nStudents declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum \u2013 a for-credit course with limited enrollment \u2013 students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives.

High heat is the usual method for cooking the filet mignon, either [[grilling]], [[pan frying]], [[broiling]], or [[roasting]].\n\nBacon is often used in cooking filet mignon because of the low levels of fat found in the cut (see [[Bacon grease|barding]]), as fillets have low levels of [[marbled meat|marbling]], or intramuscular fat.
