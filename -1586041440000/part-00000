The album remained in the top five on the ''Billboard'' 200 for 38 weeks, setting a record for the longest run in the top five by an album from a male solo artist. By 1989, it had become the second-best-selling album of all time at the time, behind ''Thriller'', having sold 22 million copies worldwide. It was also the best-selling album worldwide of 1988 and 1989.\n\n''Bad'' was promoted with the film, ''[[Moonwalker]]'' (1988), which included the music videos of songs from the album, including \"[[Speed Demon (song)|Speed Demon]]\", \"[[Leave Me Alone (Michael Jackson song)|Leave Me Alone]]\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"[[Smooth Criminal]]\". The film became the best-selling [[home video]] of all time. At the [[30th Annual Grammy Awards|30th Grammy Awards]], Jackson performed \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"Man in the Mirror\".

It was nominated for six [[Grammy Award]]s, winning [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Recording \u2013 Non Classical]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] (for \"Leave Me Alone\"). At the 1989 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], Jackson received the first [[Billboard Music Award for Spotlight|Spotlight Award]] in recognition for being the first artist to have five number one singles from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''Bad'' was awarded [[Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album|Album of the Year]].

He said its \"studio mastery\", along with Jackson's \"rhythmic and vocal power\", had made for \"the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years\", but lamented its lack of \"genius\" in the vein of \"Beat It\" or \"Billie Jean\" and panned the underlying themes in Jackson's lyrics. \"He's against burglary, speeding, and sex ('Dirty Diana' is as misogynistic as any piece of metal suck-my-cock), in favor of harmonic convergence and changing the world by changing the man in the mirror.

The most notable difference is the lack of horns in all the choruses except for the last two. Horns are also missing from the second and third pre-choruses. The rhythm guitar during the choruses is also turned up along with the hi-hats.\n* \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" \u2013 The full-length remix used for the single with louder vocals and ad libs added to the end replaced the original album mix.\n* \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" omits Michael Jackson's spoken intro.\n* \"Dirty Diana\" is replaced with the single edit of the song.\n* \"Smooth Criminal\" went through two changes on the album. It was remixed to make the kick drum heavier and the bass synth fatter. The quick-sequenced synclavier behind the bass has been rendered mono as well. The first version of this mix left the breathing intact, but was later removed after some time.\n* \"Leave Me Alone\" was not included on the original vinyl nor cassette releases but was included on the CD release and now is included in all releases.\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel as listed in the album's [[liner notes]] are:<ref name=\"linernotes\"/>\n* Lead and backing vocals: [[Michael Jackson]]\n* Background vocals: [[Siedah Garrett]] (tracks 7\u20138), [[The Winans]] (7), and The [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]] Choir (7)\n* Bass guitar: [[Nathan East]] (track 8)\n* [[Hammond organ]]: [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] (track 1)\n* Drums: [[John Robinson (drummer)|John Robinson]] (tracks 1\u20134, 9\u201310), Miko Brando (3), [[Ollie E.

It sold over 2 million copies in its first week in the US, and 500,000 in its first five days in the UK. Nine songs were released as official singles, and one as a promotional single. Seven charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles from one album|record-breaking five number ones]]: \"[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]\", \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]\", \"[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]\", \"[[Man in the Mirror]]\" and \"[[Dirty Diana]]\". The album remained in the top five on the ''Billboard'' 200 for 38 weeks, setting a record for the longest run in the top five by an album from a male solo artist. By 1989, it had become the second-best-selling album of all time at the time, behind ''Thriller'', having sold 22 million copies worldwide. It was also the best-selling album worldwide of 1988 and 1989.\n\n''Bad'' was promoted with the film, ''[[Moonwalker]]'' (1988), which included the music videos of songs from the album, including \"[[Speed Demon (song)|Speed Demon]]\", \"[[Leave Me Alone (Michael Jackson song)|Leave Me Alone]]\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"[[Smooth Criminal]]\". The film became the best-selling [[home video]] of all time. At the [[30th Annual Grammy Awards|30th Grammy Awards]], Jackson performed \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"Man in the Mirror\".

It was nominated for six [[Grammy Award]]s, winning [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Recording \u2013 Non Classical]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] (for \"Leave Me Alone\"). At the 1989 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], Jackson received the first [[Billboard Music Award for Spotlight|Spotlight Award]] in recognition for being the first artist to have five number one singles from one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''Bad'' was awarded [[Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album|Album of the Year]].

Some critics highlighted aspects of the album as being superior to ''Thriller''.

He said its \"studio mastery\", along with Jackson's \"rhythmic and vocal power\", had made for \"the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years\", but lamented its lack of \"genius\" in the vein of \"Beat It\" or \"Billie Jean\" and panned the underlying themes in Jackson's lyrics. \"He's against burglary, speeding, and sex ('Dirty Diana' is as misogynistic as any piece of metal suck-my-cock), in favor of harmonic convergence and changing the world by changing the man in the mirror.

The most notable difference is the lack of horns in all the choruses except for the last two. Horns are also missing from the second and third pre-choruses. The rhythm guitar during the choruses is also turned up along with the hi-hats.\n* \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" \u2013 The full-length remix used for the single with louder vocals and ad libs added to the end replaced the original album mix.\n* \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" omits Michael Jackson's spoken intro.\n* \"Dirty Diana\" is replaced with the single edit of the song.\n* \"Smooth Criminal\" went through two changes on the album. It was remixed to make the kick drum heavier and the bass synth fatter. The quick-sequenced synclavier behind the bass has been rendered mono as well. The first version of this mix left the breathing intact, but was later removed after some time.\n* \"Leave Me Alone\" was not included on the original vinyl nor cassette releases but was included on the CD release and now is included in all releases.\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel as listed in the album's [[liner notes]] are:<ref name=\"linernotes\"/>\n* Lead and backing vocals: [[Michael Jackson]]\n* Background vocals: [[Siedah Garrett]] (tracks 7\u20138), [[The Winans]] (7), and The [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]] Choir (7)\n* Bass guitar: [[Nathan East]] (track 8)\n* [[Hammond organ]]: [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] (track 1)\n* Drums: [[John Robinson (drummer)|John Robinson]] (tracks 1\u20134, 9\u201310), Miko Brando (3), [[Ollie E.

{"title_page": "Quota rule", "text_new": "{{short description|Rule in math and political science}}\nIn [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' describes a desired property of a [[proportional representation|proportional]] [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] or [[electoral system|election]] method. It states that the number of seats that should be allocated to a given party should be between the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of its fractional proportional share (called natural quota).<ref name=\"maa\">Michael J.

MAA Publications. Retrieved October 22, 2018</ref> As an example, if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are allotted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. Many common election methods, such as all [[highest averages method]]s, violate the quota rule.\n\n==Mathematics==\nIf <math>P</math> is the population of the party, <math>T</math> is the total population, and <math>S</math> is the number of available seats, then the natural quota for that party (the number of seats the party would ideally get) is\n:<math> \\frac P T \\cdot S</math>\n\nThe lower quota is then the natural quota rounded down to the nearest [[integer]] while the upper quota is the natural quota rounded up. The quota rule states that the only two allocations that a party can receive should be either the lower or upper quota.<ref name=\"maa\"/> If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule. Another way to state this is to say that a given method only satisfies the quota rule if each party's allocation differs from its natural quota by less than one, where each party's allocation is an integer value.<ref>Alan Stein.

The lower quota for party ''A'' is 1, because 1.8 rounded down equal 1. The upper quota, 1.8 rounded up, is 2. Therefore, the quota rule states that the only two allocations allowed for party ''A'' are 1 or 2 seats on the council. If there is a second party, ''B'', that has 137 members, then the quota rule states that party ''B'' gets <math> \\frac {137} {300} \\cdot 5 \\approx 2.3</math>, rounded up and down equals either 2 or 3 seats. Finally, a party ''C'' with the remaining 57 members of the club has a natural quota of <math> \\frac {57} {300} \\cdot 5 \\approx 0.95</math>, which means its allocated seats should be either 0 or 1. In all cases, the method for actually allocating the seats determines whether an allocation violates the quota rule, which in this case would mean giving party ''A'' any seats other than 1 or 2, giving party ''B'' any other than 2 or 3, or giving party ''C'' any other than 0 or 1 seat.\n\n===Relation to apportionment paradoxes===\nThe [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski\u2013Young_theorem|Balinski\u2013Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some [[apportionment paradox]].<ref>Beth-Allyn Osikiewicz, Ph.D. [http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf  Impossibilities of Apportionment] Retrieved October 23, 2018.</ref> For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].<ref>Warren D.

It is the first novel in the [[Gormenghast series|''Gormenghast'' series]].\n\n==Plot introduction==\nThe book is set in the huge castle of Gormenghast, a vast landscape of crumbling towers and ivy-filled quadrangles that has for centuries been the hereditary residence of the Groan family and with them a legion of servants. The Groan family is headed by [[Sepulchrave|Lord Sepulchrave]], the seventy-sixth Earl of Groan. He is a melancholy man who feels shackled by his duties as Earl, although he never questions them. His only escape is reading in his library. His wife is the Countess Gertrude. Large and imposing, with dark red hair, she pays no attention to her family or to the rest of Gormenghast. Instead, she spends her time either in her bedroom or in walking selected areas, in the company of a legion of birds and her white cats that alone command her affections. Their daughter is 15-year-old [[Fuchsia Groan]]. Self-absorbed, childish and thoughtless, she is also impulsive, imaginative and at times fiercely affectionate. Sequestered in the south wing of the castle are Sepulchrave's identical twin sisters Cora and Clarice Groan. Both suffered from epileptic fits in their youth, as a result of which their left arms and legs are \"rather starved\". They have the same vague and vacant personalities, lacking intelligence to the point of [[mental impairment]]. Both crave political power and bitterly resent Gertrude, believing that she robbed them of their rightful place in the hierarchy of Gormenghast and of any involvement in its affairs. Also important to the life of the castle is Lord Sepulchrave's personal servant, [[Mr. Flay]] who believes in strictly holding to the rules of Gormenghast.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, two agents of change are introduced into the stagnant society of Gormenghast.\n\nThe first catalyst is the birth of [[Titus Groan (character)|Titus Groan]], the heir to [[Sepulchrave|Lord Sepulchrave]], which interrupts the centuries-old daily rituals which are practiced at all levels of the castle's society, from the kitchens to the Hall of Bright Carvings in Gormenghast's upper reaches.  Though he is the title character and integral to the plot, Titus appears only infrequently as an infant during his first two years of life.\n\nThe second is [[Steerpike]], a ruthlessly ambitious kitchen boy, whose rise drives the plot of ''Titus Groan''. His escape from the kitchen during the castle celebration of Lord Titus' birth introduces change into the stultified Gormenghast society. Steerpike is [[Machiavelli]]an in his rise, but he can also appear charming and sometimes even noble.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel begins as the imperious and ritual-driven servant Mr. Flay seeks to tell someone new of the birth of an [[Titus Groan (character)|heir]] to the House of Groan in a remote part of the sprawling castle of Gormenghast.  A son is born to Lord Sepulchrave, Earl of Groan and monarchical ruler of Gormenghast, and his wife, Countess Gertrude. He is named Titus and entrusted to Nannie Slagg by his indifferent mother. Nannie Slagg is an elderly, somewhat senile woman who serves as the nurse and mother figure for the Groan children. She is often unsure of herself, but relishes the small bit of power that comes with raising the heir to the house of Groan. Her first duty is to go to the dwellings of the Bright Carvers just outside the walls of Gormenghast to choose a wet nurse for Titus. Keda, the widow of a well-respected Carver who has recently lost a child from her late husband, volunteers to take on the role. Keda comes to live in the castle for a time helping to raise Titus. Later, she leaves the castle walls and is impregnated by one of her previous two suitors. The suitors promptly kill each other in a duel for her hand in marriage.\n\nOn the same day as Titus' birth, an ambitious kitchen boy of seventeen by the name of [[Steerpike]] escapes from the kitchens and the grossly fat, sadistic chef, Abiatha Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave's chief servant, [[Mr. Flay]] (Swelter's archenemy), comes upon Steerpike who has become lost in the confines of the castle, and takes him through the castle (large parts of which are uninhabited) to a room outside the quarters of the Earl and the Countess. Here, Steerpike takes the opportunity to spy on the Groan family.\n\n[[Image:Titusnovel.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Mark Robertson's cover illustration for the Mandarin paperback edition]]\nDespite having led him there, the fiercely loyal Flay is angered by Steerpike's eavesdropping and locks him in a small room. Steerpike, however, escapes out of a window, risking his life above a sheer drop. He manages to climb up onto the roofs and towers of Gormenghast, and from there begins his rise to power.\n\nAfter spending twenty-four hours clambering over the enormous castle searching for a means to enter, Steerpike manages to climb in through a window into the secret attic of Lady [[Fuchsia Groan]]. Fuchsia, who has a great affinity to the large area of long-abandoned attic space she has had all to herself, is at first appalled and outraged by his entry. He senses the importance of her naivety and seizes her attention by putting on an elaborate performance. She is the first of the royal characters on whom Steerpike will use his cunning to exploit.\n\nA while later, Steerpike accompanies Fuchsia to the house of Dr. Prunesquallor, and becomes his apprentice for a while. Dr. Alfred Prunesquallor is the castle's resident physician. He is an eccentric individual with a high-pitched laugh and a grandiose wit which he uses on the castle's less intelligent inhabitants. Despite his acid tongue, he is an extremely kind and caring man who also is greatly fond of Fuchsia and Titus. (In a few places in the text, Dr. Prunesquallor is given the first name of Bernard, but this was an error by Peake.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}) He lives with his sister Irma Prunesquallor. Though she is anything but pretty, she is considerably vain. She desperately desires to be admired and loved by men. In this position, Steerpike is able to come into even closer contact with members of the Groan family, in particular Lord Sepulchrave's twin sisters, Cora and Clarice Groan. The sisters are not very bright and are power-hungry and resentful, believing that Countess Gertrude holds the position that they rightfully deserve.\n\n===Burning of the library===\nSteerpike manages to use the twins' ambition for his own ends. He promises them power and influence, and convinces them that they could achieve their goal by burning down Sepulchrave's beloved library. Steerpike prepares meticulously for the act of arson. He arranges for the burning to happen when the entire Groan family and their most important servants are inside the library for a family gathering (Steerpike intentionally failed to tell the twins that they were invited as well, strengthening their feeling of bitterness towards Sepulchrave and Gertrude). He intends to lock the doors to prevent an escape, and then come through the window and save everyone inside from the fire, appearing as a hero and possibly strengthening his position and granting him more power in the castle.\n\nEverything goes according to plan: the entire Groan family (including the Earl and his heir) and most of the retainers are saved. Sourdust, the old Master of Ceremonies, dies of smoke asphyxiation and all the books in the library are destroyed in the flames. This comes as a great blow to Sepulchrave, a rather melancholic man, to whom the library was the only joy in his otherwise monotonous life, dominated by the ritualistic duties he must perform every day, every week, every month and every year at appropriate times.\n\nSteerpike hoped to become Master of Ritual (a very prestigious job in Gormenghast) after Sourdust died, but the title, like so many things in the castle, is hereditary, and so goes to Sourdust's seventy-four-year-old son [[Barquentine (Gormenghast)|Barquentine]], who has lived almost completely forgotten in a remote part of the castle for sixty years. He is lame in his one leg, hideous, and unbelievably dirty. Barquentine is a consummate misanthrope who only cares for the laws and traditions of Gormenghast.\n\nDuring the weeks following the burning, Lord Sepulchrave becomes increasingly insane, starting to believe that he is one of the Death Owls living in the Tower of Flints (the tallest tower in the castle).\n\n===Flay versus Swelter===\nFlay learns that Swelter intends to kill him. Flay had hit him across the face with a chain before Titus\u2019 christening, escalating a mutual loathing into plans for vengeful murder. Flay observes Swelter practising the blow with a large cleaver, and so prepares himself for an attack, acquiring a sword for his protection, in case Swelter should ever attempt to murder him while he is sleeping in front of his master's door.\n\nThings happen differently though: Steerpike, now a full-time retainer of the twins, having quit Doctor Prunesquallor's service, angers Flay by sarcastically imitating Sepulchrave's madness. Flay loses control and hurls one of the countess\u2019 white cats at Steerpike. At that moment, the Countess enters the room, and seeing that one of her beloved cats has been abused, immediately banishes Flay from Gormenghast.\n\nFlay is forced to learn how to survive outside the castle, and he sets up various homes in the nearby forest and on Gormenghast Mountain. Having a strong attachment to the castle, and feeling a need to watch over Steerpike and to protect Titus, Flay returns secretly to Gormenghast during the night. Four nights after Titus\u2019 first birthday, Flay finds Swelter wandering the castle with a meat cleaver. Swelter does not know of Flay's banishment, and expects him to be sleeping where he has always slept up until now. Flay follows him to just outside Sepulchrave's door, where Swelter discovers that Flay is not there, and soon realizes that he has been followed. Flay lures Swelter to the Hall of Spiders (making use of the fact that Sepulchrave \u2014 who is by now quite insane \u2014 is sleepwalking), and there they fight a long duel. Eventually, Flay kills Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave arrives on the scene, and decides that Swelter's body should be taken to the Tower of Flints. After helping Sepulchrave carry the body to the tower, Flay is ordered to stay where he is. The mad Earl babbles about possible reincarnation, bids Flay farewell, and then drags the body into the tower by himself and is attacked and eaten by the starved Death Owls, along with Swelter's remains.\n\nAfter the disappearance of the Earl and the chief cook (the exiled Flay is not able to tell anyone what has happened), Steerpike leads a search for them. Naturally, their remains are not found, but Steerpike is able to gain a good knowledge of all the rooms in the castle.\nFlay lives in the mountains, making two caves and a shed for himself - living in seclusion but adept as a naturalist. He later witnesses Keda's suicide as she throws herself off a ledge. Initially just one of a number of minor background characters Keda's story shows some of the world outside the castle and her choices, journey and resolution are among the most emotive parts of the story.\n\n===The Earling===\nNine days after Sepulchrave's disappearance, Steerpike has a conversation with Barquentine. The Master of Ceremonies tells Steerpike that Titus is now to become Earl of Groan, despite the fact that he is only one year old. He also gives Steerpike the position of his assistant and heir to his post, since Barquentine does not have a child. As the apprentice to the Master of Ceremonies, Steerpike has a good, stable position in the castle, and can now study the inner workings of the castle.\n\nSteerpike fears that Cora and Clarice are too careless and may tell others that he convinced them to burn down Sepulchrave's library. Steerpike dresses as a ghost and convinces the twins they will die if they ever speak of the fire. By this stage, Steerpike has considerable influence in the affairs of Gormenghast, even if he is not yet a recognised figure of authority. He still has to influence people to do his work for him. Despite this, both the Countess and Dr Prunesquallor are disturbed and uneasy about all that has happened, and disturbed about Steerpike's sudden rise. Yet neither is able to connect Steerpike as the cause of the tragic events, as he was their apparent saviour from the fire in the library.\n\nSoon afterwards, the \u201cEarling\u201d takes place, and young Titus is officially made Earl of Gormenghast. In a ridiculously elaborate ceremony on a nearby lake, little Titus holds aloft the sacred symbols of his status \u2013 the stone and ivy branch, and to the horror of observers, promptly drops them both into the lake. The scene is silent except for the shout of Titus and for the shout of Keda's unnamed baby, with a surrogate parent across the lake with the Bright Carvers.\n\n==Other minor characters==\n'''Rottcodd:''' The curator of the Hall of Bright Carvings and the first character introduced in the series. Rottcodd lives the life of a recluse in the castle, rarely speaking to anyone and, when not dusting the statues at exactly seven o'clock, is usually sleeping in his hammock by the windowside. Flay feels the need to tell someone of the birth of Titus, and chooses Rottcodd, who is so cut off from the life of the castle that he is the only person left who has not heard the news. The book also ends with Rottcodd as he looks out the window at the entire population of the castle returning from Titus' Earling. Everyone had been invited except for him, as he had been forgotten.\n\n'''Pentecost:''' Pentecost was one of the Outer Dwellers once, but worked himself up to become the head gardener of the palace.\n\n'''The Poet:''' Known only by his professional name, the Poet holds a relatively important function of ritual in the castle. He is described as having a wedge-shaped head and a voice \"as strange and deep as a lugubrious ocean\". He is said to be the only person who can hold Lord Sepulchrave's interest in conversation. Steerpike comes across him on his journey across the rooftops, reciting a poem to himself out of his window. Upon realising that he has been overheard, the Poet wildly over-reacts, and tries to block up his window.\n\n'''Rantel and Braigon:''' Keda's lovers, whose rivalry eventually leads to their death in a nighttime duel.\n\n'''Bright Carvers:''' or '''Mud Dwellers''' Hereditary population of the extensive Mud Village situated up against and outside the walls of Gormenghast Castle, who are famed for their skill in woodcarving.\n\n'''Springers, Spurter''' and '''Wrattle:''' Kitchen boys. Three of Swelter's helper's in the preparation of the Ceremonial Breakfast for Titus.\n\n'''Wrenpatch''' and '''Flycrake:''' Kitchen boys. Swelter relishes the prospect of punishing them for arguing with each other, violating Swelter's strict orders for silence.\n\n'''Grey Scrubbers:''' Hereditary cleaners of the Great Kitchen.\n\n'''Old Man:''' Hermit, only known as \"Old Man\". He cares for Keda as she recovers from the rigours of her travels in the wilds.\n\n'''Smelly Old Woman:''' The Ladies Clarice and Cora's only servant. Used by Steerpike as an example of just how low the status of the Ladies Clarice and Cora has fallen as he draws them into his power.\n\n'''Pellet:''' Servant in the Prunesquallors' household. He is replaced by Steerpike at the instigation of Irma Prunesquallor.\n\n'''Shrattle:''' Armourer. Holds the only key to Groan armoury.\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1984, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast two 90-minute plays based on ''Titus Groan'' and ''[[Gormenghast (novel)|Gormenghast]]'', adapted by [[Brian Sibley]] and starring [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as [[Steerpike]] and [[Freddie Jones]] as the Artist (narrator).

At that moment, the Countess enters the room, and seeing that one of her beloved cats has been abused, immediately banishes Flay from Gormenghast.\n\nFlay is forced to learn how to survive outside the castle, and he sets up various homes in the nearby forest and on Gormenghast Mountain. Having a strong attachment to the castle, and feeling a need to watch over Steerpike and to protect Titus, Flay returns secretly to Gormenghast during the night. Four nights after Titus\u2019 first birthday, Flay finds Swelter wandering the castle with a meat cleaver. Swelter does not know of Flay's banishment, and expects him to be sleeping where he has always slept up until now. Flay follows him to just outside Sepulchrave's door, where Swelter discovers that Flay is not there, and soon realizes that he has been followed. Flay lures Swelter to the Hall of Spiders (making use of the fact that Sepulchrave \u2014 who is by now quite insane \u2014 is sleepwalking), and there they fight a long duel. Eventually, Flay kills Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave arrives on the scene, and decides that Swelter's body should be taken to the Tower of Flints. After helping Sepulchrave carry the body to the tower, Flay is ordered to stay where he is. The mad Earl babbles about possible reincarnation, bids Flay farewell, and then drags the body into the tower by himself and is attacked and eaten by the starved Death Owls, along with Swelter's remains.\n\nAfter the disappearance of the Earl and the chief cook (the exiled Flay is not able to tell anyone what has happened), Steerpike leads a search for them. Naturally, their remains are not found, but Steerpike is able to gain a good knowledge of all the rooms in the castle.\nFlay lives in the mountains, making two caves and a shed for himself - living in seclusion but adept as a naturalist. He later witnesses Keda's suicide as she throws herself off a ledge. Initially just one of a number of minor background characters Keda's story shows some of the world outside the castle and her choices, journey and resolution are among the most emotive parts of the story.\n\n===The Earling===\nNine days after Sepulchrave's disappearance, Steerpike has a conversation with Barquentine. The Master of Ceremonies tells Steerpike that Titus is now to become Earl of Groan, despite the fact that he is only one year old. He also gives Steerpike the position of his assistant and heir to his post, since Barquentine does not have a child. As the apprentice to the Master of Ceremonies, Steerpike has a good, stable position in the castle, and can now study the inner workings of the castle.\n\nSteerpike fears that Cora and Clarice are too careless and may tell others that he convinced them to burn down Sepulchrave's library. Steerpike dresses as a ghost and convinces the twins they will die if they ever speak of the fire. By this stage, Steerpike has considerable influence in the affairs of Gormenghast, even if he is not yet a recognised figure of authority. He still has to influence people to do his work for him. Despite this, both the Countess and Dr Prunesquallor are disturbed and uneasy about all that has happened, and disturbed about Steerpike's sudden rise. Yet neither is able to connect Steerpike as the cause of the tragic events, as he was their apparent saviour from the fire in the library.\n\nSoon afterwards, the \u201cEarling\u201d takes place, and young Titus is officially made Earl of Gormenghast. In a ridiculously elaborate ceremony on a nearby lake, little Titus holds aloft the sacred symbols of his status \u2013 the stone and ivy branch, and to the horror of observers, promptly drops them both into the lake. The scene is silent except for the shout of Titus and for the shout of Keda's unnamed baby, with a surrogate parent across the lake with the Bright Carvers.\n\n==Other minor characters==\n'''Rottcodd:''' The curator of the Hall of Bright Carvings and the first character introduced in the series. Rottcodd lives the life of a recluse in the castle, rarely speaking to anyone and, when not dusting the statues at exactly seven o'clock, is usually sleeping in his hammock by the windowside. Flay feels the need to tell someone of the birth of Titus, and chooses Rottcodd, who is so cut off from the life of the castle that he is the only person left who has not heard the news. The book also ends with Rottcodd as he looks out the window at the entire population of the castle returning from Titus' Earling. Everyone had been invited except for him, as he had been forgotten.\n\n'''Pentecost:''' Pentecost was one of the Outer Dwellers once, but worked himself up to become the head gardener of the palace.\n\n'''The Poet:''' Known only by his professional name, the Poet holds a relatively important function of ritual in the castle. He is described as having a wedge-shaped head and a voice \"as strange and deep as a lugubrious ocean\". He is said to be the only person who can hold Lord Sepulchrave's interest in conversation. Steerpike comes across him on his journey across the rooftops, reciting a poem to himself out of his window. Upon realising that he has been overheard, the Poet wildly over-reacts, and tries to block up his window.\n\n'''Rantel and Braigon:''' Keda's lovers, whose rivalry eventually leads to their death in a nighttime duel.\n\n'''Bright Carvers:''' or '''Mud Dwellers''' Hereditary population of the extensive Mud Village situated up against and outside the walls of Gormenghast Castle, who are famed for their skill in woodcarving.\n\n'''Springers, Spurter''' and '''Wrattle:''' Kitchen boys. Three of Swelter's helper's in the preparation of the Ceremonial Breakfast for Titus.\n\n'''Wrenpatch''' and '''Flycrake:''' Kitchen boys. Swelter relishes the prospect of punishing them for arguing with each other, violating Swelter's strict orders for silence.\n\n'''Grey Scrubbers:''' Hereditary cleaners of the Great Kitchen.\n\n'''Old Man:''' Hermit, only known as \"Old Man\". He cares for Keda as she recovers from the rigours of her travels in the wilds.\n\n'''Smelly Old Woman:''' The Ladies Clarice and Cora's only servant. Used by Steerpike as an example of just how low the status of the Ladies Clarice and Cora has fallen as he draws them into his power.\n\n'''Pellet:''' Servant in the Prunesquallors' household. He is replaced by Steerpike at the instigation of Irma Prunesquallor.\n\n'''Shrattle:''' Armourer. Holds the only key to Groan armoury.\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1984, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast two 90-minute plays based on ''Titus Groan'' and ''[[Gormenghast (novel)|Gormenghast]]'', adapted by [[Brian Sibley]] and starring [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as [[Steerpike]] and [[Freddie Jones]] as the Artist (narrator).

Adolphus can also appear as a surname, as in [[John Adolphus]], the English historian.

The name is [[cognate]] to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] name ''[[\u00c6thelwulf]]'' (also Eadulf or [[Eadwulf]]).

Adolphus can also appear as a surname, as in [[John Adolphus]], the English historian. The name is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] derived from the [[Old High German]] ''Athalwolf'', a composition of ''athal'', or ''adal'', meaning \"noble\", and  ''[[wolf]]''. The name is [[cognate]] to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] name ''[[\u00c6thelwulf]]'' (also Eadulf or [[Eadwulf]]). The name can also be derived from the ancient Germanic elements \"Wald\" meaning \"power\", \"brightness\" and wolf.\n{{Infobox given name2 \n| name = Adolf\n| image = Siegel_Adolf_von_Nassau_Posse.JPG\n| caption = King [[Adolf of Germany]]\n| pronunciation = {{IPA-de|\u02c8a\u02d0d\u0254lf}}\n| gender = Male\n| related names = \n| variant forms = Adi (nickname), Addie (nickname), Alf (short), Alfie (nickname), Adolff, Adolph, Adolphe, Adolphus, Adolfo, Dolfy (nickname), Adalwolf, Waldwolf\n| meaning = ''Noble wolf'', ''wolf power'' or ''bright wolf''\n| language = German, French, Italian, Spanish, Welsh, Portuguese\n| seealso =\n}}\n\n==Popularity and usage==\nDuring the 19th and early 20th century, ''Adolf'' was a popular name for baby boys in German-speaking countries and to a lesser extent also in French-speaking countries (spelled there as ''Adolphe'').

Walter Patton (in ''A\u1e25mad Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na'') presents him as a stalwart of orthodoxy, claimed that he did more than any other to strengthen the position of [[orthodoxy]].<ref name=\"WMP1897:2\"/>\n\n===The ''Mihna''===\nScholars do not agree on why caliph al-Ma\u2019mun acted as he did.   Walter Patton for instance, claims that while partisans might have made political capital out of the public adoption of the doctrine, al-Ma\u2019mun\u2019s intention was \u201cprimarily to effect a religious reform.\u201d <ref name=WMP1897:54>[[#WMP1897|Patton, ''Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na'', 1897]]: p.54</ref> Nawas on the other hand, argues that the doctrine of createdness was a \u201cpseudo-issue,\u201d insisting that its promulgation was unlikely an end in itself since the primary sources attached so little significance to its declaration.<ref>Nawas, 1994: 623-624.</ref>\n\nThe test of the mihna was applied neither universally nor arbitrarily. In fact, the letter that Al-Ma\u2019mun sent to his lieutenant in Baghdad instituting the mihna stipulated that the test be administered to [[qadis]] and [[Muhaddith#Muhaddith|traditionists]] (muhaddithin). Both of these groups regard hadith as central to Qur\u2019anic interpretation and to matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. In particular, the rhetorical force of muhaddithin acceptance of the doctrine is then to concede that either or both of the Qur\u2019an and the hadith corpus attest to the doctrine, simultaneously validating the caliph\u2019s theological position and legitimizing his claim to hermeneutical authority with regard to the [[sacred texts]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=October 2017}}\n{{too few opinions|date=August 2017}}\n}}\n\n== The significance of hadith ==\nThat the question of the createdness of the Qur\u2019an is, among other things, a [[hermeneutical]] issue is reflected in the variety of arguments and issues that associate with it \u2013 whether the Qur\u2019an or the traditions assert the Qur\u2019an\u2019s createdness, what \u201ccreated\u201d means, and whether and how this affects the standing of these texts as [[authoritative]] and as a consequence, the status of those who study them. Where the Qur\u2019an is understood as the word of God, and the words and example of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] transmitted through [[hadith]] also attain to divine significance, if the Qur\u2019an cannot be taken to assert its own createdness, for the doctrine of createdness to be true the traditions would have to support it. Indeed, to admit the insufficiency of the hadith corpus to adjudicate what with the institution of the mihna becomes such a visible dispute would necessarily marginalize the authority of traditions.

He was willing to \u201cargue\u201d only on the basis of the Qur\u2019an or the traditions and their \u201cliteral\u201d meaning.<ref name=WMP1897:106>[[#WMP1897|Patton, ''Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na'', 1897]]: p.106</ref> While this distinction itself is difficult to make in practice, its value is in part rhetorical, for the assertion marks his orthodox identity as one who stands by the absolute authority of the sacred texts over-above those who make use of [[Mu'tazila#Reason and revelation|reason]].\nThe role of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] in the mihna ordeal garnered significant attention in the later [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]] of Islam.  Walter Patton (in ''A\u1e25mad Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na'') presents him as a stalwart of orthodoxy, claimed that he did more than any other to strengthen the position of [[orthodoxy]].<ref name=\"WMP1897:2\"/>\n\n===The ''Mihna''===\nScholars do not agree on why caliph al-Ma\u2019mun acted as he did.   Walter Patton for instance, claims that while partisans might have made political capital out of the public adoption of the doctrine, al-Ma\u2019mun\u2019s intention was \u201cprimarily to effect a religious reform.\u201d <ref name=WMP1897:54>[[#WMP1897|Patton, ''Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na'', 1897]]: p.54</ref> Nawas on the other hand, argues that the doctrine of createdness was a \u201cpseudo-issue,\u201d insisting that its promulgation was unlikely an end in itself since the primary sources attached so little significance to its declaration.<ref>Nawas, 1994: 623-624.</ref>\n\nThe test of the mihna was applied neither universally nor arbitrarily. In fact, the letter that Al-Ma\u2019mun sent to his lieutenant in Baghdad instituting the mihna stipulated that the test be administered to [[qadis]] and [[Muhaddith#Muhaddith|traditionists]] (muhaddithin). Both of these groups regard hadith as central to Qur\u2019anic interpretation and to matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. In particular, the rhetorical force of muhaddithin acceptance of the doctrine is then to concede that either or both of the Qur\u2019an and the hadith corpus attest to the doctrine, simultaneously validating the caliph\u2019s theological position and legitimizing his claim to hermeneutical authority with regard to the [[sacred texts]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=October 2017}}\n{{too few opinions|date=August 2017}}\n}}\n\n== The significance of hadith ==\nThat the question of the createdness of the Qur\u2019an is, among other things, a [[hermeneutical]] issue is reflected in the variety of arguments and issues that associate with it \u2013 whether the Qur\u2019an or the traditions assert the Qur\u2019an\u2019s createdness, what \u201ccreated\u201d means, and whether and how this affects the standing of these texts as [[authoritative]] and as a consequence, the status of those who study them. Where the Qur\u2019an is understood as the word of God, and the words and example of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] transmitted through [[hadith]] also attain to divine significance, if the Qur\u2019an cannot be taken to assert its own createdness, for the doctrine of createdness to be true the traditions would have to support it. Indeed, to admit the insufficiency of the hadith corpus to adjudicate what with the institution of the mihna becomes such a visible dispute would necessarily marginalize the authority of traditions. Thus it is not by accident that al-Ma\u2019mun decides to administer the test on [[Islamic scholar|religious scholars]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical literalism]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[History of Islam]]\n* [[Ibn Kullab]]\n* [[Islam]]\n* [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic Schools and Branches]]\n* [[Qur'anic exegesis|Qur\u2019anic exegesis]]\n* [[Sufficiency of Scripture#Sufficiency|Sufficiency of scripture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{cite book|first=Walter Melville |last=Patton|title=A\u1e25mad Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na: A Biography of the Im\u00e2m including an Account of the Mo\u1e25ammadan Inquisition Called the Mi\u1e25na: 218-234 A.H. |publisher=Leiden: E.J.

Their place was taken by 2010\u201311 [[Montenegrin Second League|Second League]] champions [[FK Bokelj|Bokelj]], who returned to the top league of Montenegro after an absence of three seasons.\n\n10th-placed [[FK Mornar|Mornar]] and 11th-placed [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] had to compete in two-legged relegation play-offs. Sutjeska kept their place in the First League by beating Second League runners-up [[FK Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje|Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje]] 1\u20130 on aggregate. On the other hand, Mornar were relegated after losing to Second League third-placed team [[FK Berane]] on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]; the two-leg affair ended 1\u20131. Berane thus made their immediate return to the league, while Mornar were relegated after two seasons in the top flight.\n\n{{Location map+|Montenegro|float=right|width=250|caption=Location of teams in
