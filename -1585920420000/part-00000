For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits.

J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an \"intelligence explosion\"; he also stated that the risks were underappreciated:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hilliard |first1=Mark |title=The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |accessdate=15 March 2020 |work=The Irish Times |date=2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.

Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation.

Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage.

For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).</ref> This could prove problematic because it might put an artificial intelligence in direct competition with humans.\n\nCiting [[Steve Omohundro]]'s work on the idea of [[instrumental convergence]] and \"basic AI drives\", Stuart Russell and [[Peter Norvig]] write that \"even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards.\" Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources.<ref name=\"aima\"/> Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, \"we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems\", but it is not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\nIn dissent, evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] argues that \"AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\"; perhaps instead \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\"<ref name=shermer/> Russell and fellow computer scientist [[Yann LeCun]] disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that \"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct{{nbsp}}... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives\", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in{{nbsp}}... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider \"reasonable\", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}</ref>\n\nWhile the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical \"[[is-ought distinction]]\", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any \"rational\" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical \"optimizing machine\" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any \"moral facts\" that would get in the way of goal completion.<ref name=armstrong/>\n\nOne argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus (\"-\") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

The most notable AI researchers to endorse the thesis are [[I. J. Good|I.J. Good]], who advised [[Stanley Kubrick]] on the filming of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and  [[Stuart J. Russell]].

Tests are often ordered after thyroid cancer treatment. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===\nIn the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs), alternatively referred to as TgAb. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals.

Circulating thyroglobulin has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before thyroglobulin levels become undetectable. Thyroglobulin levels may be tested regularly for a few weeks or months following the removal of the thyroid.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/thyroglobulin/|title=Thyroglobulin: MedlinePlus Lab Test Information|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.{{what?|date=April 2016}}  \n\nA subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma.

Thyroglobulin is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. \n\nThyroglobulin levels are tested via a simple blood test. Tests are often ordered after thyroid cancer treatment. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===\nIn the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs), alternatively referred to as TgAb. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals. ATAs are also found in patients with [[Hashimoto's encephalopathy]], a neuroendocrine disorder related to\u2014but not caused by\u2014Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<ref name=\"pmid12601119\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferracci F, Moretto G, Candeago RM, Cimini N, Conte F, Gentile M, Papa N, Carnevale A | title = Antithyroid antibodies in the CSF: Their role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy | journal = Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 712\u20134 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12601119 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000048660.71390.c6 }}</ref>\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nThyroglobulin has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with [[Binding immunoglobulin protein]].<ref name=\"pmid11294872\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Delom F, Mallet B, Carayon P, Lejeune PJ | title = Role of extracellular molecular chaperones in the folding of oxidized proteins.

|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> \nThe medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient.

|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> \nThe medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient.

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea_\u015echeia.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the modern city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress (''Cetatea \u0218cheia'') or the Western Fortress of Suceava (''Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei''). Unlike the Seat Fortress, currently ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruins. The citadel was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century, but was short-lived, because it was dismantled in early 15th century, during the reign of Alexander I of Moldavia. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, like the Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in Moldavia in the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] (''Muzeul Bucovinei''). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]]\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]]\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]]\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress. The scene presents some notable people from the history of Moldavia, made in glass fiber: [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (ruler of Moldavia), Maria Voichi\u021ba (his third wife), [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] (his son and successor to the throne), officials of that time. The scene chosen to be reconstructed is an allotment of land for peasants. The reconstitution is based on medieval documents, frescoes and archaeological researches. Furthermore, the history museum periodically organizes a wide range of cultural events, several of which also involve the local branch of the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istorielocala.ro/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=878:forumul-democrat-al-germanilor-din-bucovina&Itemid=204|author=www.istorielocala.ro|work=Istoria Local\u0103 @ biblioteca ta public\u0103|title=Forumul Democrat al Germanilor din Bucovina (in Romanian)|date= 14 October 2013| accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adz.ro/artikel/artikel/die-geschichte-der-deutschen-in-rumaenien-wurde-noch-nicht-zu-ende-geschrieben/|author=www.adz.ro|work=Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung f\u00fcr Rum\u00e4nien|title=Die Geschichte der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien wurde noch nicht zu Ende geschrieben (in German)|date= 8 January 2014| accessdate= 1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBukovina Village Museum (''Muzeul Satului Bucovinean'') is an open-air museum that highlights the traditional cultural and architectural heritage of [[Bukovina]] region. It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the 1970s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Gura Humorului|Humor]], [[C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]], and [[F\u0103lticeni]].\n\nThe museum includes among others a water mill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]], a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from [[Marginea]] and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in [[Vama, Suceava|Vama]], a village in [[Suceava County]]. The bell tower is also made in wood, and dates from 1787. The church and the bell tower were both relocated in 2001, and currently are part of the museum.\n\n[[File:Hanul Domnesc din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Princely Inn (now Ethnographic Museum)]]\n\nBesides Bukovina Village Museum, another museum that reflects the traditional life in this part of Romania is the ethnographic museum. It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava (''Hanul Domnesc din Suceava''). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum. The Princely Inn is the oldest civic building in Suceava which had not been seriously affected by time and maintained its original architecture.\n\n[[File:Muzeul de Stiintele Naturii din Suceava4.jpg|thumb|right|Natural Sciences Museum]]\n\nThe natural sciences museum was founded in 1976\u20131977, being the newest museum in Suceava. It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811\u20131814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\n\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian (''Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian'') is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from [[Bukovina]], manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\n\n===Historical buildings===\n\n[[File:Casa Aleea Trandafirilor nr. 4 din Suceava1.jpg|thumb|left|Austrian-style house situated in the old city centre.]]\n\n''Colegiul de Art\u0103 Ciprian Porumbescu'' (Ciprian Porumbescu Art College) is a high school which is hosted in a historic building, built in 1859, in the city center of Suceava. The building had several destinations in the past: Suceava Town Hall (until 1904) and ''\u0218coala primar\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103 de fete'' (Primary Romanian school for girls).

It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].

[[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609. [[Vorone\u021b Monastery]] is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Suceava, in the town of [[Gura Humorului]].\n\n====German Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches====\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Biserica Sf.

They were of both Roman Catholic and Evangelical Lutheran faith given the fact that they had a rather diverse geographic origin from which they initially stemmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bukowinafreunde.de/Neuer%20Ordner/faq/Bukovina%20and%20its%20Bukovina%20Germans.pdf|author=www.bukowinafreunde.de|work=Bukowina Freunde|title=Bukovina and its Bukovina Germans by Willi Kosiul|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://master.cedcsv.ro/cedc/infos/informatica/Minoritatile_conlocuitoare_din_judetul_Suceava/Germanii/germanii.html|author=www.mastercedcsv.ro|work=Minorit\u0103\u021bile conlocuitoare din jude\u021bul Suceava|title=Germanii (in Romanian)|accessdate= 31 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, these German-speaking colonists who were settled by the Austrian Empire in the city proper can trace their origins most notably from present-day southern [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Bohemia]], both Catholics and Protestants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Welisch-2002-1.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The History of Bukovina by Dr. Sophie A.

Their cultural and historical legacy is highlighted by a series of well preserved religious buildings that still exist to this today.\n\nThe most representative ecclesiastical landmark established by the local Armenian population is Zamca Monastery (the term Zamca can actually trace its linguistic origin to [[Polish language|Polish]], denoting as such a 'fortified place' and being named this way by [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in 1691), a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calatoresc.ro/descopera-orasul-suceava/|author=Isabela|work=c\u0103l\u0103toresc.ro|title=Descoper\u0103 ora\u0219ul Suceava (in Romanian)|date=2 October 2013|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nZamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentius. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\n\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians. It was founded in 1512\u20131513, and is located on the south-western proximity of the city, on a valley near [[European route E85]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nIn the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly. The most important sights in the town date from its time as a princely capital (i.e. the Middle Ages). There are numerous museums in the city proper including, most notably, the Bucovina History Museum, the Bucovina Village Museum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muzeulbucovinei.ro/muzeul-satului-bucovinean/|author=www.monitorulsv.ro|work=Muzeul Bucovinei|title=Muzeul Satului Bucovinean|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> Bucovina Ethnographic Museum (housed in an inn dating back to the 17th century),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orasulsuceava.ro/unde-iesim/obiective-turistice/muzee/muzeul-etnografic-hanul-domnesc/|work=Ora\u0219ul Suceava|title=Muzeul Etnografic Hanul Domnesc (in Romanian)|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref> or the Natural History Museum.\n\n== Sports ==\n\n=== Football ===\n\n[[File:Stadionul Areni7.jpg|thumb|right|Areni Stadium stand]]\n\n[[ACS Foresta Suceava]] ({{lang-ro|Asocia\u021bia Club Sportiv Foresta Suceava}}), formerly known as Rapid CFR Suceava, is the football team that currently represents the city of Suceava in the third tier of the Romanian football system, more specifically in [[Liga III]].\n\nIn the past, the city has also had other significant football clubs competing in either [[Liga I]] or Liga II (depending on their level of performance) such as [[CSM Suceava]], [[FC Cetatea Suceava]], or [[Foresta F\u0103lticeni|Foresta Suceava]] (the latter one being initially based in the city of [[F\u0103lticeni]] from the same county). The city also used to have another Liga III side called [[Sporting Suceava]], but due to financing reasons the club had subsequently went bankrupt and ceased playing.\n\nAll the major sporting events are hosted on the [[Stadionul Areni|Areni Stadium]], a multi-purpose stadium in Suceava.

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea_\u015echeia.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the modern city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress (''Cetatea \u0218cheia'') or the Western Fortress of Suceava (''Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei''). Unlike the Seat Fortress, currently ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruins. The citadel was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century, but was short-lived, because it was dismantled in early 15th century, during the reign of Alexander I of Moldavia. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, like the Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in Moldavia in the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] (''Muzeul Bucovinei''). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]]\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]]\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]]\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress. The scene presents some notable people from the history of Moldavia, made in glass fiber: [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (ruler of Moldavia), Maria Voichi\u021ba (his third wife), [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] (his son and successor to the throne), officials of that time. The scene chosen to be reconstructed is an allotment of land for peasants. The reconstitution is based on medieval documents, frescoes and archaeological researches. Furthermore, the history museum periodically organizes a wide range of cultural events, several of which also involve the local branch of the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istorielocala.ro/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=878:forumul-democrat-al-germanilor-din-bucovina&Itemid=204|author=www.istorielocala.ro|work=Istoria Local\u0103 @ biblioteca ta public\u0103|title=Forumul Democrat al Germanilor din Bucovina (in Romanian)|date= 14 October 2013| accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adz.ro/artikel/artikel/die-geschichte-der-deutschen-in-rumaenien-wurde-noch-nicht-zu-ende-geschrieben/|author=www.adz.ro|work=Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung f\u00fcr Rum\u00e4nien|title=Die Geschichte der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien wurde noch nicht zu Ende geschrieben (in German)|date= 8 January 2014| accessdate= 1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBukovina Village Museum (''Muzeul Satului Bucovinean'') is an open-air museum that highlights the traditional cultural and architectural heritage of [[Bukovina]] region. It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the 1970s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Gura Humorului|Humor]], [[C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]], and [[F\u0103lticeni]].\n\nThe museum includes among others a water mill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]], a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from [[Marginea]] and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in [[Vama, Suceava|Vama]], a village in [[Suceava County]]. The bell tower is also made in wood, and dates from 1787. The church and the bell tower were both relocated in 2001, and currently are part of the museum.\n\n[[File:Hanul Domnesc din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Princely Inn (now Ethnographic Museum)]]\n\nBesides Bukovina Village Museum, another museum that reflects the traditional life in this part of Romania is the ethnographic museum. It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava (''Hanul Domnesc din Suceava''). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum. The Princely Inn is the oldest civic building in Suceava which had not been seriously affected by time and maintained its original architecture.\n\n[[File:Muzeul de Stiintele Naturii din Suceava4.jpg|thumb|right|Natural Sciences Museum]]\n\nThe natural sciences museum was founded in 1976\u20131977, being the newest museum in Suceava. It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811\u20131814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\n\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian (''Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian'') is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from [[Bukovina]], manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\n\n===Historical buildings===\n\n[[File:Casa Aleea Trandafirilor nr. 4 din Suceava1.jpg|thumb|left|Austrian-style house situated in the old city centre.]]\n\n''Colegiul de Art\u0103 Ciprian Porumbescu'' (Ciprian Porumbescu Art College) is a high school which is hosted in a historic building, built in 1859, in the city center of Suceava. The building had several destinations in the past: Suceava Town Hall (until 1904) and ''\u0218coala primar\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103 de fete'' (Primary Romanian school for girls).

Initially established as a small village in the 15th century under the rulership of [[Alex\u0103ndrel of Moldavia]], it subsequently expanded as a German-speaking colony much later, specifically starting in the late 19th century, seeing an influx of German settlers during the [[Josephine colonization]] ({{lang-de|Josephinische Kolonisation}}) which took place in the time of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Talsky-Josef-Heimat-von-gestern-Regional-distribution-of-Germans-in-Bukovina.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Regional Distribution of the Germans in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Stephani-Claus-1978-Settlement-of-German-Population-Groups-in-Bukovina-E.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Golden Bistritz - The Settlement of German Population Groups in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> [[Suceava North railway station|The north railway station]] (which depicts architectural elements of both [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and [[Neo-romanticism|Neo-romanticist]] styles, also the oldest in the city) is situated in this neighbourhood as well.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n\nNear the fortress, in \u0218ipote-Cetate Park, there is an [[equestrian statue]] of Stephen the Great, designed and made by the local sculptor Iftimie B\u00e2rleanu in 1977. The monument has 23 meters in height, being the tallest equestrian statue in Romania. In the city centre there's also a statue dedicated to [[Petru Mu\u0219at]], Prince of Moldavia between 1375\u20131391.\n\n===Religious buildings===\n\n====Romanian Orthodox churches====\n\nOne of the most important cultural sites in Suceava is [[Saint John the New Monastery]] which includes the monumental Church of [[Saint George]], built between 1514 and 1522. The construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].

[[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609. [[Vorone\u021b Monastery]] is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Suceava, in the town of [[Gura Humorului]].\n\n====German Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches====\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Biserica Sf.

Their cultural and historical legacy is highlighted by a series of well preserved religious buildings that still exist to this today.\n\nThe most representative ecclesiastical landmark established by the local Armenian population is Zamca Monastery (the term Zamca can actually trace its linguistic origin to [[Polish language|Polish]], denoting as such a 'fortified place' and being named this way by [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in 1691), a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calatoresc.ro/descopera-orasul-suceava/|author=Isabela|work=c\u0103l\u0103toresc.ro|title=Descoper\u0103 ora\u0219ul Suceava (in Romanian)|date=2 October 2013|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nZamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentius. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\n\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians. It was founded in 1512\u20131513, and is located on the south-western proximity of the city, on a valley near [[European route E85]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nIn the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly.

The fish has a long tubular body, commonly {{convert|55-80|mm|in}} to {{convert|126|mm|in}}.  The body's upper and lower surfaces are gently and evenly curved with the upper surface partly flattened before the pelvic fins.  Head medium size and noticeably wider than deep and slightly wedge-shaped from the side.  Mouth of medium length with the tip of the upper lip usually level with the middle of the eye then extending down and back towards the belly to a point about even with the middle of the eye.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\nMountain galaxias are very variable in base colour and markings throughout their range, but within individual populations, less so.  Body mostly tan, light brown to brown or olive, occasionally orange-brown.  Base colour extends over head and snout and becomes lighter below the [[lateral line]] and cream or sometimes nearly white on the belly.  The base colour is overlaid with an extremely variable pattern of dark markings such as spots blotches and bands sometimes coming together to form irregular vertical bands.  This pattern may be pale or non existent in some populations and individuals and additionally there may be body shading made up of many tiny grey spots.  Often there is a series of closely spaced oval to almost circular very dark bars along the sides, although these markings may be pale to non-existent in some populations, but when present are always more numerous, thinner, closer together and more variable in shape than in ''[[Galaxias fuscus]]'' as well as generally extending further back along the body to at least as far as the anal fin.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\nFins fleshy based, paired fins less so, with the pectoral fins medium sized and paddle shaped set low on the body.  Pelvic fins are also low and positioned at about the mid point of the body.  Anal fin medium sized with the dorsal fin base about 90 percent that of the anal fin.  Tail fin of medium length with well developed flanges commonly extending as far forward as the anal fin.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Galaxias olidus distribution.jpg|thumb|Distribution map of ''Galaxias olidus'']]\n''G. olidus'' occupies a vast geographical range on both sides of the [[Great Dividing Range]] from southern [[Queensland]], south through eastern [[New South Wales]], across much of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and further west to the [[Adelaide Hills]] in [[South Australia]], thus being found both in the [[Murray-Darling]] basin and in eastern and southern coastal drainages.  How much of their coastal distribution is due to natural [[river capture]] events (although much of it is) and how much may be due to migration is not clear, for many of the species complex members have the ability to \"climb\" natural migration barriers with modified pelvic fin structures.{{r|McDowall2006}}{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\nWithin the Murray-Darling system, the mountain galaxias continues the trend of specialisation into upland and lowland habitats, with this species generally found in upland habitats, and the [[Flathead galaxias (Australia)|flathead galaxias]] found in lowland habitats, though ''G. olidus'' strays down to the upland/lowland transition zone in some rivers particularly in South Australia.  In addition many other members of the species complex have ranges confined to the upper reaches of their respective drainages.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\n==Habitat==\nOccurs in a wide variety of freshwater habitats at both low to high elevations.  Typical reaches vary from slow to moderately flowing, clear to turbid, medium to large rivers {{convert|4-20|m|ft}} in width, as well as moderate to fast flowing small to medium creeks about {{convert|0.5-5|m|ft}} wide.  Additionally, Mountain galaxias is found in some low level wetlands, billabongs and on stream farm dams throughout Victoria and central to northern NSW and some upland lakes and remnant pools in drying watercourses.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\nGenerally, the fish is found in shallow riffle zones or medium depth runs, especially in areas also inhabited by predators, to deeper pools around {{convert|0.3-1.2|m|ft}} in depth.  Mostly found near the stream bed or taking shelter among thick [[macrophytes]], rocks, woody debris or undercut banks.  Occasionally found in mid-stream but usually only in areas without predators.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\nAt high elevations along the Great Dividing Range, ''G.olidus'' occurs in streams that are snow covered for differing amounts of time during winter.  Especially in Victoria and southern New South Wales in areas above the snow line Mountain galaxias inhabits streams that freeze over and are snow covered for two to three months.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\n==Lifecycle/Reproduction==\nRestricted to freshwater with no downstream migration to the sea or brackish water in its lifecycle.  In the upper reaches of some streams may be the only fish present, but at lower elevations is often collected with a wide variety of fish and crustaceans such as freshwater shrimp, prawns and crayfish.  Spawning of ''Galaxias olidus'' occurs at differing times across its range from early May to June in South Australia, May to August in Victoria and the far south of New South Wales and as late as August to October in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\n==Conservation==\nLeast concern.{{r|IUCN}}\n\n==Utility to humans==\nNot generally considered an angling target due to small size, but can provide good sport on ultra-lightweight tackle or fly.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs =\n<ref name=fishbase>\n {{FishBase\n  |genus=Galaxias\n  |species=olidus\n  |year=2014\n  |month=11\n }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=Raadik2014>\n {{cite journal \n  |author=Raadik, T.A. \n  |year=2014 \n  |title=Fifteen from one: a revision of the ''Galaxias olidus'' G\u00fcnther, 1866 complex (Teleostei, Galaxiidae) in south-eastern Australia recognises three previously described taxa and describes 12 new species. \n  |journal=Zootaxa \n  |volume=3898 \n  |issue=1 \n  |pages=1\u2013198 \n  |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2014/f/zt03898p198.pdf \n  |doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3898.1.1\n  |accessdate=26 July 2019\n }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=McDowall2006>\n {{cite journal\n  | author = McDowall R.M. \n  | year = 2006 \n  | title = Crying wolf, crying foul, or crying shame: alien salmonids and a biodiversity crisis in the southern cool-temperate galaxioid fishes? \n  | url = \n  | journal = Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries \n  | volume = 16 \n  | issue = \n  | pages = 233\u2013422 \n  | doi=10.1007/s11160-006-9017-7\n }}\n</ref>\n<!--<ref name=ffg>{{cite web\n  |publisher=Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning\n  |title=Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, Threatened List' November 2019\n  |url=https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/115827/20191114-FFG-Threatened-List.pdf\n  |accessdate=13 December 2019\n }}\n</ref>-->\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxTpd2XVe5I Video of Mountain Galaxias in the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia]\n* [http://www.nativefish.asn.au/home/page/Mountain-Galaxias Native Fish Australia - Mountain Galaxias page]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4848081}}\n\n[[Category:Galaxias]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of Australia]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1866]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the Mountain Galaxias fish species|the species complex|Mountain Galaxias (species complex)}}\n{{Taxobox\n| name = Mountain galaxias\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=IUCN>{{Cite iucn |author=Raadick, T.\n | title=''Galaxias olidus''\n | journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]\n | volume=2019\n | page=e.T122902529A123382141\n | publisher=[[IUCN]] \n | date=2019 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/122902529/123382141 \n | doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2019-3.RLTS.T122902529A123382141.en}}</ref>\n| image = Galaxias olidus.jpg\n| image_caption = ''Galaxias olidus''\n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Chordata]]\n| classis = [[Actinopterygii]]\n| ordo = [[Osmeriformes]]\n| familia = [[Galaxiidae]]\n| subfamilia = [[Galaxiinae]]\n| genus = ''[[Galaxias]]''\n| species = '''''G. olidus'''''\n| binomial = ''Galaxias olidus''\n| binomial_authority = [[Albert G\u00fcnther|G\u00fcnther]], 1866\n| synonyms =\n''Galaxias bongbong'' <small>Macleay, 1881</small><br />\n''Galaxias findlayi'' <small>Macleay, 1882</small><br />\n''Galaxias kayi'' <small>Ramsay & Ogilby, 1886</small><br />\n''Galaxias oconnori'' <small>Ogilby, 1912</small><br />\n''Galaxias schomburgkii'' <small>Peters, 1868</small>\n}}\n'''''Galaxias olidus''''', the '''mountain galaxias''', is a [[species]] of freshwater [[Galaxiidae|galaxiid]] [[fish]] widely found in southeastern [[Australia]].{{r|fishbase}}{{r|Raadik2014}}\n\n==Description==\nAs for other members of the species complex, although ''Galaxias olidus'' exhibits a greater range of characteristics than other members of the group.

In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

He did this to facilitate the import of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, the jetty was in a poor state, with The Straits Times noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1 million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

Its initial name was UDMC Seafood Centre, which was later changed in 2000 to its current name. Popularized for housing several major local seafood restaurants, the seafood centre serves local favourites such as [[chilli crab]], [[black pepper crab]] and [[mee goreng]]. In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the\nnew location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a Straits Times reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre did generally well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the two years prior. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marine Cove]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the import of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, the jetty was in a poor state, with The Straits Times noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1 million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.
