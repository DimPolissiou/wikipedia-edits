This land would be sold in part to its original owner as well as his brother-in-law, as the family moved yet again inside New York to a one acre property in Amenia.

Phillips was recorded in the diary of Dr. Samuel Barstow of GHis work satisfied the local standard, and within two years Phillips was receiving regular portrait commissions from community leaders in this area of western Massachusetts.<ref name=\"Hollander\" />\n\nUnlike Phillips' illustrious predecessors in American art, such as [[Benjamin West]] of Philadelphia and [[John Singleton Copley]] of Boston, Phillips lived and worked on the rural frontier\u2014a difference which is key to understanding his career. Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits (a luxury good that reflects and signals a certain social standing) outside the capitals was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n \nPhillips may actually have learned some of his skills from the portraits by John Vanderlyn he saw hanging in the homes of his wealthy patrons. Some aspects of Phillips' works are reminiscent of Vanderlyn's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall.

New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2012. P. 36.</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery of the Artist and Reconstruction of his Body of Work==\n\nPhillips' modern rediscovery began in 1924, when a group of portraits of women, shown leaning forward in three-quarter view and wearing dark dresses, were displayed in an antique show in [[Kent, Connecticut]]. The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved June 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A. Phillips, and the Kent Limner are one and the same person.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Additional works were identified, showing the artist's transition from the delicate coloration of the Border period to the bold and dramatic works that followed.

Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\".<ref name=\"Black1976\"/> Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, [[Erastus Salisbury Field]], who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nThe Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788\u20131865,\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968.

This land would be sold in part to its original owner as well as his brother-in-law, as the family moved yet again inside New York to a one acre property in Amenia. In the 1850 census, Phillips is recorded for the first time under the profession of portrait painter, now living in North East, New York.

Phillips was recorded in the diary of Dr. Samuel Barstow of GHis work satisfied the local standard, and within two years Phillips was receiving regular portrait commissions from community leaders in this area of western Massachusetts.<ref name=\"Hollander\" />\n\nUnlike Phillips' illustrious predecessors in American art, such as [[Benjamin West]] of Philadelphia and [[John Singleton Copley]] of Boston, Phillips lived and worked on the rural frontier\u2014a difference which is key to understanding his career. Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits (a luxury good that reflects and signals a certain social standing) outside the capitals was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n \nPhillips may actually have learned some of his skills from the portraits by John Vanderlyn he saw hanging in the homes of his wealthy patrons. Some aspects of Phillips' works are reminiscent of Vanderlyn's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Retrieved June 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A.

Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\".<ref name=\"Black1976\"/> Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, [[Erastus Salisbury Field]], who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nThe Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788\u20131865,\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968.

And if they didn't like it, when they looked at their phones they could just click something else; ... we are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button.\"\n\n\"So when you're [busking] on the street, .. to command [your] attention, people would be like: 'again! again!' .. 'more! more!' .. or they would just leave. So if you replace [the lyric]: 'dance for me, dance for me' with 'sing for me, sing for me,' it's pretty literal,\" she said.<ref>https://www.novafm.com.au/show/smallzys-surgery/tones-and-i-explains-how-she-went-busker-festival-performer-within-year/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was produced by Visible Studios, directed by Liam Kelly and Nick Kozakis and released on 24 June 2019.<ref name=\"Dance Monkey video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q|title=Tones and I \u2013 Dance Monkey (Official Video)|via=YouTube|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> The video follows \"Mr. Tones\" ([[Tones and I]]), an elderly man who sneaks out of his home to have a dance party at a golf course with other senior citizens.

And if they didn't like it, when they looked at their phones they could just click something else; ... we are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button.\"\n\n\"So when you're [busking] on the street, .. to command [your] attention, people would be like: 'again! again!' .. 'more! more!' .. or they would just leave. So if you replace [the lyric]: 'dance for me, dance for me' with 'sing for me, sing for me,' it's pretty literal,\" she said.<ref>https://www.novafm.com.au/show/smallzys-surgery/tones-and-i-explains-how-she-went-busker-festival-performer-within-year/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was produced by Visible Studios, directed by Liam Kelly and Nick Kozakis and released on 24 June 2019.<ref name=\"Dance Monkey video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q|title=Tones and I \u2013 Dance Monkey (Official Video)|via=YouTube|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> The video follows \"Mr. Tones\" ([[Tones and I]]), an elderly man who sneaks out of his home to have a dance party at a golf course with other senior citizens.

Individuals may report that what they see lacks vividness and emotional coloring. Emotional response to visual recognition of loved ones may be significantly reduced. Feelings of ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]'' or ''[[jamais vu]]'' are common. Familiar places may look alien, bizarre, and surreal. One may not even be sure whether what one perceives is in fact reality or not.  The world as perceived by the individual may feel as if it were going through a [[dolly zoom]] effect. Such perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste, and smell.\n\nThe degree of familiarity one has with their surroundings is among one's sensory and [[psychological identity]], memory foundation and history when experiencing a place. When persons are in a state of derealization, they block this identifying foundation from recall. This \"blocking effect\" creates a discrepancy of correlation between one's perception of one's surroundings during a derealization episode, and what that same individual would perceive in the absence of a derealization episode.\n\nFrequently, derealization occurs in the context of constant worrying or \"[[intrusive thought]]s\" that one finds hard to switch off.  In such cases it can build unnoticed along with the underlying [[anxiety]] attached to these disturbing thoughts, and be recognized only in the aftermath of a realization of crisis, often a [[panic attack]], subsequently seeming difficult or impossible to ignore. This type of anxiety can be crippling to the affected and may lead to avoidant behavior. Those who experience this phenomenon may feel concern over the cause of their derealization. It is often difficult to accept that such a disturbing symptom is simply a result of anxiety, and the individual may often think that the cause must be something more serious. This can, in turn, cause more anxiety and worsen the derealization. Derealization also has been shown to interfere with the learning process, with cognitive impairments demonstrated in immediate recall and visuospatial deficits.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guralnik|first=Orna|last2=Giesbrecht|first2=Timo|last3=Knutelska|first3=Margaret|last4=Sirroff|first4=Beth|last5=Simeon|first5=Daphne|date=December 2007|title=Cognitive Functioning in Depersonalization Disorder|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=195|issue=12|pages=983\u20138|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e31815c19cd|pmid=18091191|issn=0022-3018}}</ref> This can be best understood as the individual feeling as if they see the events in third person; therefore they cannot properly process information, especially through the visual pathway.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Spiegel | first1 = David | last2 = Carde\u00f1a | first2 = Etzel | title = Disintegrated experience: The dissociative disorders revisited. | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | year = 1991 | pages = 366-378 | issn = 1939-1846 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.100.3.366 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21236606 }}</ref>{{Failed verification |date=February 2020| reason = This reference supports the first clause, but probably not the second clause (starting from therefore).
