Kennedy assassination}}\n[[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963. In the aftermath, several government agencies and panels investigated the circumstances surrounding the assassination, and all concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was the assassin. However, Oswald was murdered by a Mafia associated night club owner [[Jack Ruby]] before he could be tried in a court of law. The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories about how and why Kennedy was assassinated, as well as the possibility of a conspiracy. \nIn 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but that a second gunman besides Oswald probably also fired at Kennedy, and that a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] was probable.<ref name=\"HCSA-S\">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref><ref name=\"HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75\">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65\u201375.</ref> The Committee's conclusion of a conspiracy was based almost entirely on the results of a forensic analysis of a police [[dictabelt]] recording, which was later disputed.{{sfn|Bugliosi 2007|p=377}}\n\n==Origin==\nIn 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in 1981, but this verdict was overturned on appeal. The magazine was found not liable when the case was retried in 1985. In 1985, Hunt was in court again in a libel suit against [[E. Howard Hunt#Later life|''Liberty Lobby'']]. During the trial, defense attorney [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] was successful in creating doubt among the jury as to Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination through depositions from [[David Atlee Phillips]], [[Richard Helms]], [[G.

Kennedy assassination}}\n[[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963. In the aftermath, several government agencies and panels investigated the circumstances surrounding the assassination, and all concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was the assassin. However, Oswald was murdered by a Mafia associated night club owner [[Jack Ruby]] before he could be tried in a court of law. The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories about how and why Kennedy was assassinated, as well as the possibility of a conspiracy. \nIn 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but that a second gunman besides Oswald probably also fired at Kennedy, and that a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] was probable.<ref name=\"HCSA-S\">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref><ref name=\"HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75\">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65\u201375.</ref> The Committee's conclusion of a conspiracy was based almost entirely on the results of a forensic analysis of a police [[dictabelt]] recording, which was later disputed.{{sfn|Bugliosi 2007|p=377}}\n\n==Origin==\nIn 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in 1981, but this verdict was overturned on appeal. The magazine was found not liable when the case was retried in 1985. In 1985, Hunt was in court again in a libel suit against [[E. Howard Hunt#Later life|''Liberty Lobby'']]. During the trial, defense attorney [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] was successful in creating doubt among the jury as to Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination through depositions from [[David Atlee Phillips]], [[Richard Helms]], [[G.

Buchanan claimed that Oswald had tried to infiltrate the International Anti-Communist Brigade.

The 700 series was introduced in 1982 with the luxurious 760, followed two years later by the lower priced 740 which capitalized on the prestige attained by the very similar 760. The 700 series was then gradually replaced, beginning in 1990, by the [[Volvo 900 Series|900 series]]. The 700, designed by [[Jan Wilsgaard]], was originally to have been a replacement for the [[Volvo 200 Series|200 series]], but production of that model continued until the early nineties. The expensive 780, a [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed coup\u00e9 version, entered production in 1986 and departed without a direct successor only four years later.\n\nThe most visible differences between the 700 and the 900 series were the more rounded corners on the body of the latter, and a somewhat better-appointed interior. The 700 series came to an end in late 1992<ref>[http://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-company/heritage/heritage-models/44-740-wagon ]{{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref> when the last 740s were built (although they were considered to be of model year 1993). The range had been augmented and finally supplanted by the [[Volvo 900]] in 1993, with the last of the 900s being sold in 1998.\n\n[[Category:Volvo vehicles|700]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]]\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Volvo 740==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Volvo 740\n| image        = Volvo 700 sedan -- 01-13-2010.jpg\n| aka          =\n| body_style   = {{ubl |4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] |5-door [[station wagon|estate]]}}\n| production   = 1984\u20131992\n| assembly     = {{ubl |Sweden: [[Kalmar]] ([[Volvo Kalmar Assembly|VKA]]) |Belgium: [[Ghent]] |Canada: [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] ([[Volvo Halifax Assembly|VHA]]) |Australia: [[Melbourne]]  ([[Volkswagen Australia|Motor Producers Ltd]] 1985-1988)}}\n| engine       = {{ubl\n  |'''[[Petrol engine|Petrol:]]'''\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B19/B200]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B204]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B19/B200T]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B204FT]]'' 16V [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B23/B230]]'' I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine#B234|B234]]'' 16V I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B23/B230ET/FT]]'' turbo I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel:]]''' \n  | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24 engine|D24]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n  | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24T engine|D24T]]'' [[turbodiesel|td]] I6\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl |4-speed ''Volvo M46'' [[Manual transmission|manual]] |5-speed ''Volvo M47'' manual |4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| length       = {{ubl |{{convert|4800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1982\u20131986) |{{convert|4785|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1987\u20131989) |{{convert|4850|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1990\u20131991) |{{convert|4808|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1992\u20131993)}}\n| width        = {{ubl |{{convert|1750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1982\u20131986) |{{convert|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1987\u20131993)}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{ubl |saloon: {{convert|1410|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} |estate: {{convert|1435|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n| weight       = saloon: <br> {{convert|1315|-|1404|kg|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1990/1990_740/90740_24.htm#113 |title=Volvo 1990 740 Model |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1989 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1992/1992_740/92740_9_1.html#specs |title=1992 Volvo 740 |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1991 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref> <br> estate: <br> {{convert|1371|-|1458|kg|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1986/1986_740/86740_08.htm |title=1986 Volvo 740 GL, GLE, Turbo |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1985 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1988/1988_740/88740_08.htm |title=1988 Volvo 740 |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1987 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIntroduced in early 1984 (in the U.S. and Australia for the 1985 [[model year]]), the 740 arrived nearly two years after the luxurious 760.<ref name = vhistory>{{cite web | url = https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/10665 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160531180323/https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/10665 | archivedate = 2016-05-31 | date = 2003-01-08 | title = 1980-1989 a historical review | id = 10665 | publisher = Volvo Car UK | work = Press Releases }}</ref> It was the lower-end version of the original 760, intended to be a [[mid-size car]] that offered more style, performance, and luxury than the 200 series.

The 740 was available as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (sometimes referred to as the 744) and a five-door [[station wagon]] (also known as the 745). The station wagon premiered simultaneously at the 1985 [[Canadian International AutoShow|Toronto]] and [[Chicago Auto Show|Chicago]] auto shows in early February 1985.

In 1991, both the 740 and the newly introduced 940 received an updated dashboard, similar in appearance to the ones found in the 760. The 740 remained mostly unchanged for the 1992 model year, and sales ended in 1993. Production of the 740 ceased on October 2, 1992, though the engine, transmission, chassis, and other details continued in the [[Volvo 900 Series#940|Volvo 940]] (introduced in September 1990), which was essentially identical to the 740 with the exception of the rear of the sedans. \n\nAside from styling, 1990 also marked a number of mechanical improvements to the 740 series. The B200 and B230 motors received larger {{convert|13|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} connecting rods. The 740 Turbo switched from the [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] T3-series turbocharger to the [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] TD04 series, which offers quicker spool-up and better boost at low engine speeds, albeit at the expense of top-end performance. The electronic fuel injection system was upgraded from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic#LH Jetronic (c.1983-c.1998)|LH-Jetronic]] 2.2 to 2.4 (in 1988 for [[naturally aspirated]] cars, in 1990 for turbocharged cars). The newer fuel system offers onboard diagnostics, which are accessible from the engine compartment and require no special equipment. For 1993, the final model year for the 740, the mechanical engine cooling fan was replaced with an electric fan.\n\n===Versions===\nTrim levels were 740, 740 GL, 740 GLE, 740 SE, 740 GLT and 740 Turbo, worldwide.\n\n[[Continental Europe|Continental]] markets had some exceptions to this rule. The 740 Turbo 16V (most markets received the 2.3 litre eight-valve turbo engine) was sold mainly in Italy, but also in Portugal and Belgium, and used the 2-litre B204FT engine found also in the 780 for these same markets. The 740 Turbo 16V was equipped with the ECC from the 780 as standard.\n\nLate in 1991, Volvo offered a sedan and wagon badged the 740 SE, standing for \"special equipment\". The 740 SE came in three colors; red, black, and white. Mechanically, the 740 SE was the same as a normal 740 Turbo, but with many features, such as a power sunroof and leather seats, as standard equipment. The SE also had a special factory color-keyed body kit, including front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and a spoiler for the sedan. The 740 SE, along with the 740 Turbo sedan, was discontinued for 1992.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Volvo 760==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Volvo 760\n| image = 1987-1989 Volvo 760 GLE sedan (2011-11-18) 01.jpg\n| caption = Volvo 760 GLE (facelift model)\n| production = 1982\u20131990\n| assembly = Sweden: [[Kalmar]] ([[Volvo Kalmar Assembly|VKA]]) <br> Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] <ref>[http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/features/1508/12-orphan-cars-built-in-australia/ James Stanford, 12 orphan cars built in Australia, www.wheelsmag.com.au] Retrieved 11 July 2016</ref> <br> Belgium: [[Ghent]]<br />Canada: [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] ([[Volvo Halifax Assembly|VHA]])\n| body_style = 4-door saloon <br> 5-door estate\n| engine = {{ubl | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine#B23 Turbo|B23ET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines|B230ET]]'' turbo I4 | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines|B230FT/FT+]]'' turbo I4 | 2.8&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines#V6|B28E/F]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.8&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines#V6|B280E/F]]'' V6 | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24TIC engine|D24TIC]]'' [[turbodiesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] }}\n| transmission = 5-speed Volvo M47 manual <br> 4-speed Volvo M46 manual <br> 4-speed [[Volvo AW70 series transmissions|''AW71'']] automatic <br> 4-speed [[Volvo AW70 series transmissions|''AW72L'']] automatic (lockup torque converter) <br> 4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|''ZF4HP22'']] automatic (lockup torque converter)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1982\u20131987: {{convert|4800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>1988-1990: {{convert|4790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1982\u20131987: {{convert|1750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>1988-1990: {{convert|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1410|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|1435|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (estate)\n| weight = {{convert|1360|-|1510|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1985/1985_760_gle_turbo/85760_08.htm |title=1985 Volvo 760 GLE, Turbo |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1984 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe 760 marked a new strategy for Volvo, as they introduced the executive six-cylinder model first with the less prestigious 740 only following a few years later. Jan Wilsgaard, head of Volvo's Design and Styling Team, proposed over 50 new designs for the new car.\n\nIt was introduced to the U.S. in 1982 for the 1983 model year as the 760 GLE saloon, having been launched in Sweden in February 1982 and in Britain from July 1982.<ref name = vhistory/> In February 1985 the 760 Station Wagon (\"765\" in internal parlance) was introduced, going on sale in US and Canada a few months later.<ref name=AGp132/> European markets only received the wagons beginning in the autumn, for the 1986 model year.\n\nThis new design was criticized by the media when released: [[Gordon Murray]] of ''Autocar Magazine'' said, \"to me it's obscene. That goes right against the grain of what everybody else is trying to do. To me it looks like a European version of a North American car. It produces the same amount of power as a 2600 or 3500 &mdash; in this day and age it disgusts me to see something about like that. It's a definite step backwards.\" All that changed however when ''Autocar'' and ''Car & Driver'' got their hands on a turbo intercooled 760; they said it was one of the best handling and fastest accelerating cars they had seen in a while, going from 0-60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in under 8 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[File:1984 Volvo 760 GLE sedan (27858621516).jpg|thumb|left|Volvo 760 GLE saloon pre-facelift (AU)]]\n\nThe Turbodiesel, while presented alongside the V6 model, was not immediately available in all markets, with Volvo focusing on markets where diesels had a high market penetration.

Unlike the lesser 740, the 760 received standard [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] in many models.\n\nFor the 1988 model year, the 760 received numerous updates.

Inside, all 760s received a revised dashboard which was angled towards the driver, 3-position tilt steering, and a new stereo system.

The 780 became available in Europe in 1986 and in United States a year later.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 780 was designed and built by [[Gruppo Bertone|Carrozzeria Bertone]] in Turin, Italy. The hood, trunk, and roof lines were all slightly lower than the standard 700 series profile, and the C-pillar was wider and had a more gradual slope down to the trunk. Headroom was improved over the 262C because of Bertone's 1&nbsp;cm lowering of the roofline. Window frames all had black matte trim, and were accented with chrome. Chrome also highlighted the door handles, bumpers, and side mouldings. Originally, it had been planned to use a smaller, 2,458&nbsp;cc turbocharged, version of the [[PRV engine|PRV]] V6 (as seen in the [[Renault 25]] and [[Renault Alpine GTA/A610|Alpine]]),<ref name=Lindh>{{Cite book | author = Lindh, Bj\u00f6rn-Eric | title = Volvo: The Cars - From the 20s to the 80s | publisher = F\u00f6rlagshuset Norden | location = Malm\u00f6, Sweden | page = 226 | year = 1986 | edition = 2nd English | isbn = 91-86442-14-7 }}</ref> which had been successfully tested in 740s and 760s. In the smaller engine compartment of the 780, however, the engine overheated and the PRV V6 Turbo never appeared in a Volvo.\n\n[[File:Volvo 780 (10075100866).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1989 Volvo 780 V6]]\nIn the first 2 years that the 780 was available worldwide (1986 and 1987) it received the B280F V6 engine and a solid (live) rear axle. In the Italian market, originally only the Volkswagen built [[Volkswagen D24TIC engine|D24TIC]] was to be offered, with {{convert|129|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=Lindh/> but soon the V6 also became available and a {{convert|155|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.0-litre turbo (B200ET) Italian tax special was also added later in 1986. In August 1987, the 780 came equipped with Volvo's independent rear suspension, which used self-leveling Nivomat shocks, to keep ride height correct. An improved climate control unit (ECC) was also fitted.<ref name=\"TV18.87\"/>\n\nThe B280F at this point had roughly {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but the car itself weighed nearly {{convert|3400|lb|abbr=on}}. To address concerns about performance, Volvo introduced the B230FT+; a B230FT with Volvo's Turbo+ boost controller, increasing the engine output to {{convert|175|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. The following model year saw it increase to {{convert|188|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. In Italy, later 780s were available with the B204GT. This was a 16 valve turbo motor producing {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A mere 165 examples of the 780 were built with this engine. In the car's final year, 1991, it was rebadged simply as \"Coup\u00e9\". At this point, the car came only in turbo guise.\n\nVolvo's official production total for the 780 is 8518 cars built between 1986 and 1991. From 1986 to 1995, Volvo offered a small, sporty coup\u00e9, the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Volvo 480]], but a successor to the 780 would only be introduced in 1997 when the [[Volvo C70|C70]] became available.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===Models===\nThe saloon model originally debuted in 1982 in Europe, and was joined by the estate for 1985.\n\nModel availability:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

The 700 series was introduced in 1982 with the luxurious 760, followed two years later by the lower priced 740 which capitalized on the prestige attained by the very similar 760. The 700 series was then gradually replaced, beginning in 1990, by the [[Volvo 900 Series|900 series]]. The 700, designed by [[Jan Wilsgaard]], was originally to have been a replacement for the [[Volvo 200 Series|200 series]], but production of that model continued until the early nineties. The expensive 780, a [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed coup\u00e9 version, entered production in 1986 and departed without a direct successor only four years later.\n\nThe most visible differences between the 700 and the 900 series were the more rounded corners on the body of the latter, and a somewhat better-appointed interior. The 700 series came to an end in late 1992<ref>[http://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-company/heritage/heritage-models/44-740-wagon ]{{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref> when the last 740s were built (although they were considered to be of model year 1993). The range had been augmented and finally supplanted by the [[Volvo 900]] in 1993, with the last of the 900s being sold in 1998.\n\n[[Category:Volvo vehicles|700]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Executive cars]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]]\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Volvo 740==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Volvo 740\n| image        = Volvo 700 sedan -- 01-13-2010.jpg\n| aka          =\n| body_style   = {{ubl |4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] |5-door [[station wagon|estate]]}}\n| production   = 1984\u20131992\n| assembly     = {{ubl |Sweden: [[Kalmar]] ([[Volvo Kalmar Assembly|VKA]]) |Belgium: [[Ghent]] |Canada: [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] ([[Volvo Halifax Assembly|VHA]]) |Australia: [[Melbourne]]  ([[Volkswagen Australia|Motor Producers Ltd]] 1985-1988)}}\n| engine       = {{ubl\n  |'''[[Petrol engine|Petrol:]]'''\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B19/B200]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B204]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B19/B200T]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B204FT]]'' 16V [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B23/B230]]'' I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine#B234|B234]]'' 16V I4\n  | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine|B23/B230ET/FT]]'' turbo I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel:]]''' \n  | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24 engine|D24]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n  | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24T engine|D24T]]'' [[turbodiesel|td]] I6\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl |4-speed ''Volvo M46'' [[Manual transmission|manual]] |5-speed ''Volvo M47'' manual |4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| length       = {{ubl |{{convert|4800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1982\u20131986) |{{convert|4785|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1987\u20131989) |{{convert|4850|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1990\u20131991) |{{convert|4808|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1992\u20131993)}}\n| width        = {{ubl |{{convert|1750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1982\u20131986) |{{convert|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (1987\u20131993)}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{ubl |saloon: {{convert|1410|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} |estate: {{convert|1435|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n| weight       = saloon: <br> {{convert|1315|-|1404|kg|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1990/1990_740/90740_24.htm#113 |title=Volvo 1990 740 Model |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1989 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1992/1992_740/92740_9_1.html#specs |title=1992 Volvo 740 |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1991 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref> <br> estate: <br> {{convert|1371|-|1458|kg|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1986/1986_740/86740_08.htm |title=1986 Volvo 740 GL, GLE, Turbo |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1985 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1988/1988_740/88740_08.htm |title=1988 Volvo 740 |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1987 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIntroduced in early 1984 (in the U.S. and Australia for the 1985 [[model year]]), the 740 arrived nearly two years after the luxurious 760.<ref name = vhistory>{{cite web | url = https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/10665 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160531180323/https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/10665 | archivedate = 2016-05-31 | date = 2003-01-08 | title = 1980-1989 a historical review | id = 10665 | publisher = Volvo Car UK | work = Press Releases }}</ref> It was the lower-end version of the original 760, intended to be a [[mid-size car]] that offered more style, performance, and luxury than the 200 series.

The station wagon premiered simultaneously at the 1985 [[Canadian International AutoShow|Toronto]] and [[Chicago Auto Show|Chicago]] auto shows in early February 1985. The wagon was aimed squarely at the North American markets and only went on sale in Europe several months later, in the fall of 1985.<ref name=AGp132>{{cite magazine | ref = AGgw | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 140 | volume = 6 | page = 132 | title = Nieuwigheden: Voor de N.-Amerikaanse markt | trans-title = News: For the N.

In 1991, both the 740 and the newly introduced 940 received an updated dashboard, similar in appearance to the ones found in the 760. The 740 remained mostly unchanged for the 1992 model year, and sales ended in 1993. Production of the 740 ceased on October 2, 1992, though the engine, transmission, chassis, and other details continued in the [[Volvo 900 Series#940|Volvo 940]] (introduced in September 1990), which was essentially identical to the 740 with the exception of the rear of the sedans. \n\nAside from styling, 1990 also marked a number of mechanical improvements to the 740 series. The B200 and B230 motors received larger {{convert|13|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} connecting rods. The 740 Turbo switched from the [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] T3-series turbocharger to the [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] TD04 series, which offers quicker spool-up and better boost at low engine speeds, albeit at the expense of top-end performance. The electronic fuel injection system was upgraded from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic#LH Jetronic (c.1983-c.1998)|LH-Jetronic]] 2.2 to 2.4 (in 1988 for [[naturally aspirated]] cars, in 1990 for turbocharged cars). The newer fuel system offers onboard diagnostics, which are accessible from the engine compartment and require no special equipment. For 1993, the final model year for the 740, the mechanical engine cooling fan was replaced with an electric fan.\n\n===Versions===\nTrim levels were 740, 740 GL, 740 GLE, 740 SE, 740 GLT and 740 Turbo, worldwide.\n\n[[Continental Europe|Continental]] markets had some exceptions to this rule. The 740 Turbo 16V (most markets received the 2.3 litre eight-valve turbo engine) was sold mainly in Italy, but also in Portugal and Belgium, and used the 2-litre B204FT engine found also in the 780 for these same markets. The 740 Turbo 16V was equipped with the ECC from the 780 as standard.\n\nLate in 1991, Volvo offered a sedan and wagon badged the 740 SE, standing for \"special equipment\". The 740 SE came in three colors; red, black, and white. Mechanically, the 740 SE was the same as a normal 740 Turbo, but with many features, such as a power sunroof and leather seats, as standard equipment. The SE also had a special factory color-keyed body kit, including front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and a spoiler for the sedan. The 740 SE, along with the 740 Turbo sedan, was discontinued for 1992.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Volvo 760==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Volvo 760\n| image = 1987-1989 Volvo 760 GLE sedan (2011-11-18) 01.jpg\n| caption = Volvo 760 GLE (facelift model)\n| production = 1982\u20131990\n| assembly = Sweden: [[Kalmar]] ([[Volvo Kalmar Assembly|VKA]]) <br> Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] <ref>[http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/features/1508/12-orphan-cars-built-in-australia/ James Stanford, 12 orphan cars built in Australia, www.wheelsmag.com.au] Retrieved 11 July 2016</ref> <br> Belgium: [[Ghent]]<br />Canada: [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] ([[Volvo Halifax Assembly|VHA]])\n| body_style = 4-door saloon <br> 5-door estate\n| engine = {{ubl | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[Volvo Redblock Engine#B23 Turbo|B23ET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines|B230ET]]'' turbo I4 | 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines|B230FT/FT+]]'' turbo I4 | 2.8&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines#V6|B28E/F]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] | 2.8&nbsp;L ''[[List of Volvo engines#V6|B280E/F]]'' V6 | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Volkswagen D24TIC engine|D24TIC]]'' [[turbodiesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] }}\n| transmission = 5-speed Volvo M47 manual <br> 4-speed Volvo M46 manual <br> 4-speed [[Volvo AW70 series transmissions|''AW71'']] automatic <br> 4-speed [[Volvo AW70 series transmissions|''AW72L'']] automatic (lockup torque converter) <br> 4-speed [[ZF 4HP22 transmission|''ZF4HP22'']] automatic (lockup torque converter)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1982\u20131987: {{convert|4800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>1988-1990: {{convert|4790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = 1982\u20131987: {{convert|1750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>1988-1990: {{convert|1760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1410|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|1435|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (estate)\n| weight = {{convert|1360|-|1510|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1985/1985_760_gle_turbo/85760_08.htm |title=1985 Volvo 760 GLE, Turbo |website=new.volvocars.com |date=1984 |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe 760 marked a new strategy for Volvo, as they introduced the executive six-cylinder model first with the less prestigious 740 only following a few years later. Jan Wilsgaard, head of Volvo's Design and Styling Team, proposed over 50 new designs for the new car.\n\nIt was introduced to the U.S. in 1982 for the 1983 model year as the 760 GLE saloon, having been launched in Sweden in February 1982 and in Britain from July 1982.<ref name = vhistory/> In February 1985 the 760 Station Wagon (\"765\" in internal parlance) was introduced, going on sale in US and Canada a few months later.<ref name=AGp132/> European markets only received the wagons beginning in the autumn, for the 1986 model year.\n\nThis new design was criticized by the media when released: [[Gordon Murray]] of ''Autocar Magazine'' said, \"to me it's obscene. That goes right against the grain of what everybody else is trying to do. To me it looks like a European version of a North American car. It produces the same amount of power as a 2600 or 3500 &mdash; in this day and age it disgusts me to see something about like that. It's a definite step backwards.\" All that changed however when ''Autocar'' and ''Car & Driver'' got their hands on a turbo intercooled 760; they said it was one of the best handling and fastest accelerating cars they had seen in a while, going from 0-60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in under 8 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[File:1984 Volvo 760 GLE sedan (27858621516).jpg|thumb|left|Volvo 760 GLE saloon pre-facelift (AU)]]\n\nThe Turbodiesel, while presented alongside the V6 model, was not immediately available in all markets, with Volvo focusing on markets where diesels had a high market penetration.

In 1985, an electronic [[Traction control system|traction control]] system was introduced. Unlike the lesser 740, the 760 received standard [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] in many models.\n\nFor the 1988 model year, the 760 received numerous updates. From the outside, the most noticeable of the over 2000 changes were the revised front sheet metal, including an aluminium hood, recessed windscreen wipers, and new aerodynamic headlights. Inside, all 760s received a revised dashboard which was angled towards the driver, 3-position tilt steering, and a new stereo system. The top versions (standard in the US) were equipped with a new electronic climate control (ECC).

The 780 became available in Europe in 1986 and in United States a year later.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 780 was designed and built by [[Gruppo Bertone|Carrozzeria Bertone]] in Turin, Italy. The hood, trunk, and roof lines were all slightly lower than the standard 700 series profile, and the C-pillar was wider and had a more gradual slope down to the trunk. Headroom was improved over the 262C because of Bertone\u2019s 1&nbsp;cm lowering of the roofline. Window frames all had black matte trim, and were accented with chrome.

In the smaller engine compartment of the 780, however, the engine overheated and the PRV V6 Turbo never appeared in a Volvo.\n\n[[File:Volvo 780 (10075100866).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1989 Volvo 780 V6]]\nIn the first 2 years that the 780 was available worldwide (1986 and 1987) it received the B280F V6 engine and a solid (live) rear axle. In the Italian market, originally only the Volkswagen built [[Volkswagen D24TIC engine|D24TIC]] was to be offered, with {{convert|129|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=Lindh/> but soon the V6 also became available and a {{convert|155|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.0-litre turbo (B200ET) Italian tax special was also added later in 1986. In August 1987, the 780 came equipped with Volvo's independent rear suspension, which used self-leveling Nivomat shocks, to keep ride height correct. An improved climate control unit (ECC) was also fitted.<ref name=\"TV18.87\"/>\n\nThe B280F at this point had roughly {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but the car itself weighed nearly {{convert|3400|lb|abbr=on}}. To address concerns about performance, Volvo introduced the B230FT+; a B230FT with Volvo's Turbo+ boost controller, increasing the engine output to {{convert|175|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. The following model year saw it increase to {{convert|188|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. In Italy, later 780s were available with the B204GT. This was a 16 valve turbo motor producing {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A mere 165 examples of the 780 were built with this engine. In the car's final year, 1991, it was rebadged simply as \"Coup\u00e9\". At this point, the car came only in turbo guise.\n\nVolvo's official production total for the 780 is 8518 cars built between 1986 and 1991. From 1986 to 1995, Volvo offered a small, sporty coup\u00e9, the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Volvo 480]], but a successor to the 780 would only be introduced in 1997 when the [[Volvo C70|C70]] became available.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===Models===\nThe saloon model originally debuted in 1982 in Europe, and was joined by the estate for 1985.\n\nModel availability:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

Conversion was apparently used as an excuse to escape slavery by Muslims who would then continue to practise Islam; crusader lords often refused to allow them to convert, and [[Pope Gregory IX]], contrary to both the laws of Jerusalem and the canon laws that he himself was partially responsible for compiling, allowed for Muslim slaves to remain enslaved even if they had converted.\n\n==Slavery in Iberia==\n\n===Slavery in Al-Andalus===\n{{main article|Arab slave trade}}\nAn early economic pillar of the Islamic empire in Iberia ([[Al-Andalus]]) during the eighth century was the slave trade. Forming relations between the Umayyads, Kh\u0101rijites and \u2018Abb\u0101sids, the flow of trafficked people from the main routes of the Sahara towards [[Al-Andalus]] <ref>Gaiser, A.

The archaeological evidence of human trafficking and proliferation of early trade in this case follows numismatics and materiality of text <ref>Gaiser, A.

This monetary structure of consistent gold influx proved to be a tenet in the development of Islamic commerce <ref>Gutierrez, J. and Valor, M.

In this regard, the slave trade outperformed and was the most commercially successful venture for maximizing capital <ref>Gaiser, A.

This major change in the form of numismatics serves as a paradigm shift from the previous Visigothic economic arrangement. Additionally, it demonstrates profound change from one regional entity to another, the direct transfer of people and pure coinage from one religiously similar semi-autonomous province to another. \n\nThe medieval [[Iberian Peninsula]] was the scene of episodic [[warfare]] among Muslims and Christians (although sometimes Muslims and Christians were allies). Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from [[Al-Andalus]] to ravage the Christian Iberian kingdoms, bringing back booty and people. For example, in a raid on [[Lisbon]] in 1189 the [[Almohad]] caliph [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] took 3,000 female and child captives, and his governor of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] took 3,000 Christian slaves in a subsequent attack upon [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]] in 1191; an offensive by [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] in 1182 brought him over two-thousand Muslim slaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm|title=Ransoming Captives, Chapter One|website=libro.uca.edu|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery in Christian Iberia===\nContrary to suppositions of historians such as [[Marc Bloch]], slavery thrived as an institution in medieval Christian Iberia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Slavery existed in the region under the Romans, and continued to do so under the [[Visigoths]].  From the fifth to the early 8th century, large portions of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by [[Visigothic Kingdom|Christian Visigothic Kingdoms]], whose rulers worked to codify human bondage. In the 7th century, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] issued the [[Visigothic Code]] (Liber Iudiciorum), to which subsequent Visigothic kings added new legislation.  Although the Visigothic Kingdom collapsed in the early 8th century, portions of the Visigothic Code were still observed in parts of Spain in the following centuries.  The Code, with its pronounced and frequent attention to the legal status of slaves, reveals the continuation of slavery as an institution in post-Roman Spain.\n\nThe Code regulated the social conditions, behavior, and punishments of slaves in early medieval Spain.  The marriage of slaves and free or freed people was prohibited.  Book III, title II, iii (\"Where a Freeborn Woman Marries the Slave of Another or a Freeborn Man the Female Slave of Another\") stipulates that if a free woman marries another person's slave, the couple is to be separated and given 100 lashes.  Furthermore, if the woman refuses to leave the slave, then she becomes the property of the slave's master.  Likewise, any children born to the couple would follow the father's condition and be slaves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=S.P.|title=The Visigothic Code|url=http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/vg3-2.pdf|website=The Library of Iberian Resources Online|location=Book III, Title II, Section III}}</ref>\n\nUnlike [[Roman law]], in which only slaves were liable to corporal punishment,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamen|first=Deborah|date=2010|title=A Corpus of Inscriptions: representing slave marks in Antiquity.|journal=University of Michigan Press|volume=55|pages=95\u2013110|jstor=41419689}}</ref> under Visigothic law, people of any social status were subject to corporal punishment.  However, the physical punishment, typically beatings, administered to slaves was consistently harsher than that administered to freed or free people. Slaves could also be compelled to give testimony under torture.  For example, slaves could be tortured to reveal the adultery of their masters, and it was illegal to free a slave for fear of what he or she might reveal under torture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=S.P.|title=The Visigothic Code|url=http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/vg3-4.pdf|website=The Library of Iberian References Online|location=Book III, Title IV, Section VI}}</ref> Slaves' greater liability to physical punishment and judicial torture suggests their inferior social status in the eyes of Visigothic lawmakers.\n\nSlavery remained persistent in Christian Iberia after the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad invasions]] in the 8th century, and the Visigothic law codes continued to control slave ownership.  However, as William Phillips notes, medieval Iberia should not be thought of as a slave society, but rather as a society that owned slaves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=William|title=Slavery in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia|date=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=10}}</ref>   Slaves accounted for a relatively small percentage of the population, and did not make up a significant portion of the labor pool. Furthermore, while the existence of slavery continued from the earlier period, the use of slaves in post-Visigothic Christian Iberia differed from early periods.  Ian Wood has suggests that, under the Visigoths, the majority of the slave population lived and worked on rural estates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Ian|chapter=Social Relations in the Visigothic Kingdom from the Fifth to the Seventh Century|title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|date=1999|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|page=195}}</ref>  \n\nAfter the Muslim invasions, slave owners (especially in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]]) moved away from using slaves as field laborers or in work gangs, and did not press slaves into military service.<ref name=\"Phillips 19\">Phillips p.19</ref> Slaves tended to be owned singly rather than in large groups.

Slaves in Le\u00f3n and Castile were more likely to be employed as field laborers, supplanting free labor to support an aristocratic estate society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barton|first1=Simon|title=The Aristocracy of Twelfth-Century Leon and Castile|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=83}}</ref>  These trends in slave populations and use changed in the wake of the Black Death in 1348, which significantly increased the demand for slaves across the whole of the peninsula.<ref>Phillips p.21</ref>\n\nChristians were not the only slaveholders in Christian Iberia. Both Jews and Muslims living under Christian rule owned slaves, though more commonly in Aragon and Valencia than in Castile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Norman|title=Jews, Visigoths & Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict|date=1994|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|pages=160\u2013161}}</ref><ref>Phillips pp.20\u201321</ref> After the conquest of Valencia in 1245, the Kingdom of Aragon prohibited the possession of Christian slaves by Jews, though they were still permitted to hold Muslim or pagan slaves.<ref>Roth pp.156, 160</ref> The main role of Iberian Jews in the slave trade came as facilitators: Jews acted as slave brokers and agents of transfer between the Christian and Muslim kingdoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThis role caused some degree of fear among Christian populations.

Slaveholders in the Christian kingdoms gradually moved away from owning Christians, in accordance with Church proscriptions. In the middle of the medieval period most slaves in Christian Iberia were Muslim, either captured in battle with the Islamic states from the southern part of the peninsula, or taken from the eastern Mediterranean and imported into Iberia by merchants from cities such as [[Genoa]].<ref>Phillips p.61</ref>  \n\nThe Christian kingdoms of Iberia frequently traded their Muslim captives back across the border for payments of money or kind.  Indeed, historian James Broadman writes that this type of redemption offered the best chance for captives and slaves to regain their freedom.<ref>Broadman p.6</ref> The sale of Muslim captives, either back to the Islamic southern states or to third-party slave brokers, supplied one of the means by which Aragon and Castile financed the [[Reconquista]]. Battles and sieges provided large numbers of captives; after the siege of [[Almeria]] in 1147, sources report that [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]] sent almost 10,000 of the city's Muslim women and children to Genoa to be sold into slavery as partial repayment of Genoese assistance in the campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Jonathan|title=The Second Crusade: Extending the Frontiers of Christendom|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=260}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Callaghan|first1=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|date=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=140}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the Reconquista, however, this source of slaves became increasingly exhausted. Muslim rulers were increasingly unable to pay ransoms, and the Christian capture of large centers of population in the south made wholesale enslavement of Muslim populations impractical.<ref>Phillips pp.60\u201361</ref>  The loss of an Iberian Muslim source of slaves further encouraged Christians to look to other sources of manpower. Beginning with the first Portuguese slave raid in sub-Saharan Africa in 1411, the focus of slave importation began to shift from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic World, and the racial composition of slaves in Christian Iberia began to include an increasing number of black Africans.<ref>Blumenthal p.20</ref><ref>Saunders pp.5\u20137</ref>  \n\nBetween 1489 and 1497 almost 2,100 black slaves were shipped from Portugal to Valencia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lawrance|first1=Jeremey|authorlink1=Black Africans in Renaissance Spanish Literature|editor1-last=Earle|editor1-first=T.F.|editor2-last=Lowe|editor2-first=K.J.P.|title=Black Africans in Renaissance Europe|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=70|chapter=Black Africans in Renaissance Spanish Literature}}</ref><ref>Saunders p.29</ref> By the end of the 15th century, Spain held the largest population of black Africans in Europe, with a small, but growing community of black ex-slaves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lawrance p.70}}</ref>  In the mid 16th century Spain imported up to 2,000 black African slaves annually through Portugal, and by 1565 most of [[Seville|Seville's]] 6,327 slaves (out of a total population of 85,538) were black Africans.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>Saunders p.29</ref>\n\n==Slavery in Moldavia and Wallachia==\n{{main article|Slavery in Romania}}\nSlavery ({{lang-ro|robie, from Slavic rob, slave}}) existed on the territory of present-day [[Romania]] from before the founding of the principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] in the 13th&ndash;14th centuries, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. Particularly in Moldavia there were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Tatars|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nThe exact origins of slavery in the [[Danubian Principalities]] are not known. There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or as slaves. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] until their social organization was destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'.\n\nHistorian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the [[Mongols]] as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.<ref>Viorel Achim, The Roma in Romanian History, [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}</ref>\n\nWhile it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities, but the arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.<ref>\u015etefan \u015etef\u0103nescu, ''Istoria medie a Rom\u00e2niei'', Vol. I, Editura Universit\u0103\u0163ii din Bucure\u015fti, Bucharest, 1991 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\n==Slavery in the Medieval Near East==\n\nThe ancient and medieval [[Near East]] includes modern day Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, with strong connections to the rest of the north African coastline. All of these areas were ruled by either the Byzantines or the Persians at the beginning of late antiquity. Pre-existing Byzantine (i.e. Roman) and Persian institutions of slavery may have influenced the development of institutions of slavery in Islamic law and jurisprudence.\n<ref>Crone, Patricia. Roman, Provincial, and Islamic Law: The Origins of the Islamic Patronate. Cambridge University Press, 1987.</ref> Likewise, some scholars have argued for the influence of Rabbinic tradition on the development of Islamic legal thought.\n<ref>Wegner, J. R. \"Islamic and Talmudic Jurisprudence: The Four Roots of Islamic Law and their Talmudic Counterparts,\" The American Journal of Legal History, 26, 1 (1982): p. 25-71.</ref> \n\nWhatever the relationship between these different legal traditions, many similarities exist between the practice of Islamic slavery in the early Middle Ages and the practices of early medieval Byzantines and western Europeans. The status of freed slaves under Islamic rule, who continued to owe services to their former masters, bears a strong similarity to ancient Roman and Greek institutions. However, the practice of slavery in the early medieval Near East also grew out of slavery practices in currency among pre-Islamic Arabs.<ref>Lewis, Bernard, Race and Slavery In the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry. Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 4.</ref>\n\nLike the Old and New Testaments and Greek and Roman law codes, the Quran takes the institution of slavery for granted, though it urges kindness toward slaves and eventual manumission, especially for slaves who convert to Islam.<ref>Lewis, 1990, p. 5.</ref> \nIn early Middle Ages, many slaves in Islamic society served as such for only a short period of time\u2014perhaps an average of seven years.<ref>Wright, John, ''The Trans-Saharan Slave Trade''.

Because of Quranic sanction of concubinage,<ref>IV:3, XXIII:6; XXXIII:50-52; LXX:30</ref> early Islamic traders, in contrast to Byzantine and early modern slave traders, imported large numbers of female slaves.<ref>Ali, Kecia.

Slaves were employed in many activities, including agriculture, industry, the military, and domestic labor. Women were prioritized over men, and usually served in the domestic sphere as menials, concubines, or wives.<ref name=\"Lewis, Race and Slavery, p. 14\">Lewis, ''Race and Slavery'', p. 14</ref>\nDomestic and commercial slaves were mostly better off than their agricultural counterparts, either becoming family members or business partners rather than condemned to a grueling life in a chain gang.

References to this latter type of slavery are rare, however.<ref name=\"Lewis, Race and Slavery, p. 14\"/> Eunuchs were the most prized and sought-after type of slave.\n\nThe most fortunate slaves found employment in politics or the military.

A kholop's master had unlimited power over his life:  he could kill him, sell him, or use him as payment upon a [[debt]]. The master, however, was responsible before the law for his kholop's actions. A person could become a kholop as a result of capture, selling himself or herself, being sold for debts or committed [[crime]]s, or marriage to a kholop. Until the late 10th century, the kholops represented a majority among the servants who worked lordly lands.\n\nBy the 16th century, slavery in [[Russia]] consisted mostly of those who sold themselves into slavery owing to poverty.<ref name=\"Richard Hellie 1984\">[[Richard Hellie]], ''Slavery in Russia, 1450\u20131725'' (1984)</ref>  They worked predominantly as household servants, among the richest families, and indeed generally produced less than they consumed.<ref>Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The [[Domostroy|Domostroi]]:  Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p15 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}</ref>  Laws forbade the freeing of slaves in times of famine, to avoid feeding them, and slaves generally remained with the family a long time; the ''[[Domostroy]]'', an advice book, speaks of the need to choose slaves of good character and to provide for them properly.<ref>Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The Domostroi:  Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p33 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}</ref>   Slavery remained a major institution in [[Russia]] until 1723, when [[Peter the Great]] converted the household slaves into house [[serfs]]. Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] earlier in 1679.<ref name=\"Richard Hellie 1984\"/>\n\nIn 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan [[Tokhtamysh]] sacked [[Moscow]], burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves.  For years the [[Khanate of Kazan|Khanates of Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] routinely made raids on Russian principalities for\nslaves and to plunder towns.

According to the Norwegian [[Gulating]] code (in about 1160), domestic slaves could not, unlike foreign slaves, be sold out of the country. This and other laws defined slaves as their master's property at the same level as cattle. It also described a procedure for giving a slave their freedom. A freed slave did not have full legal status; for example, the punishment for killing a former slave was low. A former slave's son also had a low status, but higher than that of his parents. The Norwegian law code from 1274, ''[[Landslov]]'' (Land's law), does not mention slaves, but former slaves. Thus it seems like slavery was abolished in Norway by this time. In Sweden, slavery was abolished in 1343.\n\n==Slavery in the British Isles==\n{{main article|Slavery in the British Isles}}\nBritish [[medieval Wales|Wales]] and Gaelic [[medieval Ireland (disambiguation)|Ireland]] and [[medieval Scotland|Scotland]] were among the last areas of Christian Europe to give up their institution of slavery. Under Gaelic custom, prisoners of war were routinely taken as slaves. During the period that slavery was disappearing across most of western Europe, it was reaching its height in the British Isles: the Viking invasions and the subsequent warring between Scandinavians and the natives, the number of captives taken as slaves drastically increased. The Irish church was vehemently opposed to slavery and blamed the 1169 [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] on divine punishment for the practice, along with local acceptance of [[polygyny]] and [[divorce]].\n\n==Serfdom versus slavery==\nIn considering how serfdom evolved from slavery, historians who study the divide between slavery and serfdom encounter several issues of [[historiography]] and methodology.  Some historians believe that slavery transitioned into serfdom (a view that has only been around for the last 200 years), though there is disagreement among them regarding how rapid this transition was.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=70\u201371}}</ref>   Pierre Bonnassie, a medieval historian, thought that the chattel slavery of the ancient world ceased to exist in the Europe of the 10th century and was followed by [[Feudalism|feudal]] serfdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=68}}</ref>   Jean-Pierre Devroey thinks that the shift from slavery to serfdom was gradual as well in some parts of the continent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Devroey|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Men and Women in Early Medieval Serfdom: the Ninth-Century North Frankish Evidence|journal=Past and Present|volume=166|date=2007|page=17|doi=10.1093/past/166.1.3}}</ref>   Other areas, though, did not have what he calls \"western-style serfdom\" after the end of slavery, such as the rural areas of the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Iceland]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|last1=Devroey|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Men and Women in Early Medieval Serfdom: The Ninth-Century North Frankish Evidence|journal=Past and Present|date=2000|volume=166|page=28|doi=10.1093/past/166.1.3}}</ref>   Complicating this issue is that regions in Europe often had both serfs and slaves simultaneously. In northwestern Europe, a transition from slavery to serfdom happened by the 12th century. The Catholic Church promoted the transformation by giving the example. Enslavement of fellow Catholics was prohibited in 992 and manumission was declared to be a pious act. However it remained legal to enslave people of other religions and dogmas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZW9DjTAox6EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|first=W.

Dominique Barth\u00e9lemy, among others, has questioned the very premises for neatly distinguishing serfdom from slavery, arguing that a binary classification masks the many shades of servitude.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=71}}</ref>  Of particular interest to historians is the role of serfdom and slavery within the state, and the implications that held for both serf and slave.  Some think that slavery was the exclusion of people from the public sphere and its institutions, whereas serfdom was a complex form of dependency that usually lacked a codified basis in the legal system.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=68\u201369}}</ref>  Wendy Davies argues that serfs, like slaves, also became excluded from the public judicial system and that judicial matters were attended to in the private courts of their respective lords.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Wendy|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=236\u2013238|chapter=On Servile Status in the Early Middle Ages}}</ref>\n\nDespite the scholarly disagreement, it is possible to piece together a general picture of slavery and serfdom.  Slaves typically owned no property, and were in fact the property of their masters.  Slaves worked full-time for their masters and operated under a negative [[Incentives|incentive structure]]; in other words, failure to work resulted in physical punishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=31\u201332|chapter=Slavery, Serfdom, and Other Forms of Coerced Labour: Similarities and Differences}}</ref>   Serfs held plots of land, which was essentially a form of \"payment\" that the lord offered in exchange for the serf's service.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=3|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>   Serfs worked part-time for the masters and part-time for themselves and had opportunities to accumulate personal wealth that often did not exist for the slave.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|pages=31\u201332|chapter=Slavery, Serfdom, and Other Forms of Coerced Labour: Similarities and Differences}}</ref>\n\nSlaves were generally imported from foreign countries or continents, brought to Europe via the [[slave trade]].  Serfs were typically indigenous Europeans and were not subject to the same involuntary movements as slaves.  Serfs worked in family units, whereas the concept of family was generally murkier for slaves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=2|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>  At any given moment, a slave's family could be torn apart via trade, and masters often used this threat to coerce compliant behavior from the slave.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=24\u201326|chapter=Slavery, serfdom and other forms of coerced labour: similarities and differences}}</ref>\n\nThe end of serfdom is also debated, with Georges Duby pointing to the early 12th century as a rough end point for \"serfdom in the strict sense of the term\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=79}}</ref>   Other historians dispute this assertion, citing discussions and the mention of serfdom as an institution during later dates (such as in 13th century [[England]], or in Central Europe, where the rise of serfdom coincided with its decline in Western Europe).  There are several approaches to get a time span for the transition, and [[lexicography]] is one such method.  There is supposedly a clear shift in diction when referencing those who were either slaves or serfs at approximately 1000, though there is not a consensus on how significant this shift is, or if it even exists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=69}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[numismatists]] shed light on the decline of serfdom.  There is a widespread theory that the introduction of currency hastened the decline of serfdom because it was preferable to pay for labor rather than depend on feudal obligations.  Some historians argue that landlords began selling serfs their land \u2013 and hence, their freedom \u2013 during periods of [[economic inflation]] across Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=12|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>   Other historians argue that the end of slavery came from the royalty, who gave serfs freedom through edicts and legislation in an attempt to broaden their tax base.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=38|chapter=Slavery, serfdom and other forms of coerced labour: similarities and differences}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of serfdom in some parts of medieval Europe raises several questions.  Devroey thinks it is because slavery was not born out of economic structures in these areas, but was rather a societal practice.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>  Heinrich Fichtenau points out that in Central Europe, there was not a labor market strong enough for slavery to become a necessity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fichtenau|first1=Heinrich|title=Living in the 10th century: Mentalities and Social Orders|date=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=372}}</ref>\n\n==Justifications for slavery==\nIn late Rome, the official attitude toward slavery was ambivalent. According to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's legal code]], slavery was defined as \"an institution according to the law of nations whereby one person falls under the [[property rights]] of another, contrary to nature\".<ref>David Graeber, ''Debt: The First 5000 Years'' (Brooklyn, New York: Melville House, 2011), ch. 7.</ref>\n\nJustifications for slavery throughout the medieval period were dominated by the perception of religious difference. Slaves were often outsiders taken in war. As such, Hebrew and Islamic thinking both conceived of the slave as an \"enemy within\".<ref>[[Orlando Patterson]], ''Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1982), pp. 40-41.</ref> In the Christian tradition, [[paganism|pagans]] and [[heretics]] were similarly considered enemies of the faith who could be justly enslaved. In theory, slaves who converted could embark on the path to freedom, but practices were inconsistent: masters were not obliged to [[manumission|manumit]] them and the practice of baptising slaves was often discouraged.<ref>Timothy Rayborn, ''The Violent Pilgrimage: Christians, Muslims and Holy Conflicts, 850\u20131150'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2013, p. 93.</ref> The enslavement of co-religionists was discouraged, if not forbidden, for Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. Consequently, northern European pagans and black Africans were a target for all three religious groups. Ethnic and religious difference were conflated in the justification of slavery.<ref name=\"Rayborn, p.93\">Rayborn, ''The Violent Pilgrimage'', p.93.</ref>\n\nA major Christian justification for the use of slavery, especially against those with dark skin, was the [[Curse of Ham]]. The Curse of Ham refers to a biblical parable ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209:20-27 Gen. 9:20\u201327]) in which [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], the son of [[Noah]], sins by seeing his father inebriated and naked, although scholars differ on the exact nature of Ham's transgression. Noah then curses Ham's offspring, [[Canaan]], with being a \"servant of servants unto his brethren\". Although race or skin color is not mentioned, many Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars began to interpret the passage as a curse of both slavery and black skin, in an attempt to justify the enslavement of people of color, specifically those of African descent.<ref>David M. Goldenberg, ''The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005).</ref> In the medieval period, however, it was also used by some Christians as a justification for serfdom. Muslim sources in the 7th century allude to the Curse of Ham gaining relevance as a justifying myth for the Islamic world's longstanding enslavement of Africans.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between the notion of human liberty founded in [[natural law]] and the recognition of slavery by [[canon law]] was resolved by a legal \"compromise\": enslavement was allowable given a just cause, which could then be defined by papal authority.<ref>Walter Ullmann, ''Medieval Papalism'' (Routledge, 1949), p. 57.</ref> The state of slavery was thought to be closely tied to [[original sin]].<ref>David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 92\u201394.</ref> Towards the middle of the 15th century, the [[Catholic Church and slavery|Catholic Church]], in particular the Papacy, took an active role in offering justifications for the enslavement of Saracens, pagans, Africans, and other \"infidels\". In 1452, a [[papal bull]] entitled [[Dum Diversas]] authorized [[Afonso V of Portugal|King Afonso V of Portugal]] to enslave any \"Saracens\" or \"pagans\" he encountered. The Pope, [[Pope Nicholas V]], recognized King Alfonso's military action as legitimate in the form of the papal bull, and declared the\n\n<blockquote>full and free power, through the Apostolic authority by this edict, to invade, conquer, fight, and subjugate the Saracens and pagans, and other infidels and other enemies of Christ, and ... to reduce their persons into perpetual servitude ...<ref>Pope Nicholas V, \"Dum diversas\" (1452), in ''Bullarium patronatus Portugalliae regum in ecclesiis Africae, Asiae atque Oceaniae'' (1868) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA22&dq=%22in%20perpetuam%20servitutem%22 p.&nbsp;22.]</ref><ref>Pope Nicholas V (1452), \"Dum Diversas (English Translation)\", ''Unam Sanctam Catholicam'', February 5, 2011. http://unamsanctamcatholicam.blogspot.com/2011/02/dum-diversas-english-translation.html.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a follow-up bull, released in 1455 and entitled [[Romanus Pontifex]], Pope Nicholas V reiterated his support for the enslavement of infidels in the context of Portugal's monopoly on North African trade routes.<ref>Frances Gardiner Davenport, ''European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648'' (Washington, D.C.), pp. 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nHistorians such as Timothy Rayborn have contended that religious justifications served to mask the economic necessities underlying the institution of slavery.<ref name=\"Rayborn, p.93\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arab slave trade]]\n* [[Christianity and slavery]]\n* [[Catholic Church and slavery]]\n* [[History of slavery]]\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Slavery in ancient Greece]]\n* [[Slavery in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Slavery in antiquity]]\n* [[The Bible and slavery]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Campbell, Gwyn ''et al.'' eds.

Conversion was apparently used as an excuse to escape slavery by Muslims who would then continue to practise Islam; crusader lords often refused to allow them to convert, and [[Pope Gregory IX]], contrary to both the laws of Jerusalem and the canon laws that he himself was partially responsible for compiling, allowed for Muslim slaves to remain enslaved even if they had converted.\n\n==Slavery in Iberia==\n\n===Slavery in Al-Andalus===\n{{main article|Arab slave trade}}\nAn early economic pillar of the Islamic empire in Iberia ([[Al-Andalus]]) during the eighth century was the slave trade. Forming relations between the Umayyads, Kh\u0101rijites and \u2018Abb\u0101sids, the flow of trafficked people from the main routes of the Sahara towards [[Al-Andalus]] <ref>Gaiser, A. (2014) \u201cSlaves and Silver across the Strait of Gibraltar: Politics and Trade between Umayyad Iberia and Kh\u0101rijite North Africa\u201d in Liang, Y.G. et al. (eds.)

The archaeological evidence of human trafficking and proliferation of early trade in this case follows numismatics and materiality of text <ref>Gaiser, A.

This monetary structure of consistent gold influx proved to be a tenet in the development of Islamic commerce <ref>Gutierrez, J. and Valor, M.

In this regard, the slave trade outperformed and was the most commercially successful venture for maximizing capital <ref>Gaiser, A. (2014) \u201cSlaves and Silver across the Strait of Gibraltar: Politics and Trade between Umayyad Iberia and Kh\u0101rijite North Africa\u201d in Liang, Y.G. et al. (eds.) Spanning the Strait: Studies in Unity in the Western Mediterranean, Leiden: Brill, pp. 45. </ref>. This major change in the form of numismatics serves as a paradigm shift from the previous Visigothic economic arrangement. Additionally, it demonstrates profound change from one regional entity to another, the direct transfer of people and pure coinage from one religiously similar semi-autonomous province to another. \n\nThe medieval [[Iberian Peninsula]] was the scene of episodic [[warfare]] among Muslims and Christians (although sometimes Muslims and Christians were allies). Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from [[Al-Andalus]] to ravage the Christian Iberian kingdoms, bringing back booty and people. For example, in a raid on [[Lisbon]] in 1189 the [[Almohad]] caliph [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] took 3,000 female and child captives, and his governor of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] took 3,000 Christian slaves in a subsequent attack upon [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]] in 1191; an offensive by [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] in 1182 brought him over two-thousand Muslim slaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm|title=Ransoming Captives, Chapter One|website=libro.uca.edu|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery in Christian Iberia===\nContrary to suppositions of historians such as [[Marc Bloch]], slavery thrived as an institution in medieval Christian Iberia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Slavery existed in the region under the Romans, and continued to do so under the [[Visigoths]].  From the fifth to the early 8th century, large portions of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by [[Visigothic Kingdom|Christian Visigothic Kingdoms]], whose rulers worked to codify human bondage. In the 7th century, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] issued the [[Visigothic Code]] (Liber Iudiciorum), to which subsequent Visigothic kings added new legislation.  Although the Visigothic Kingdom collapsed in the early 8th century, portions of the Visigothic Code were still observed in parts of Spain in the following centuries.  The Code, with its pronounced and frequent attention to the legal status of slaves, reveals the continuation of slavery as an institution in post-Roman Spain.\n\nThe Code regulated the social conditions, behavior, and punishments of slaves in early medieval Spain.  The marriage of slaves and free or freed people was prohibited.  Book III, title II, iii (\"Where a Freeborn Woman Marries the Slave of Another or a Freeborn Man the Female Slave of Another\") stipulates that if a free woman marries another person's slave, the couple is to be separated and given 100 lashes.  Furthermore, if the woman refuses to leave the slave, then she becomes the property of the slave's master.  Likewise, any children born to the couple would follow the father's condition and be slaves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=S.P.|title=The Visigothic Code|url=http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/vg3-2.pdf|website=The Library of Iberian Resources Online|location=Book III, Title II, Section III}}</ref>\n\nUnlike [[Roman law]], in which only slaves were liable to corporal punishment,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamen|first=Deborah|date=2010|title=A Corpus of Inscriptions: representing slave marks in Antiquity.|journal=University of Michigan Press|volume=55|pages=95\u2013110|jstor=41419689}}</ref> under Visigothic law, people of any social status were subject to corporal punishment.  However, the physical punishment, typically beatings, administered to slaves was consistently harsher than that administered to freed or free people. Slaves could also be compelled to give testimony under torture.  For example, slaves could be tortured to reveal the adultery of their masters, and it was illegal to free a slave for fear of what he or she might reveal under torture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=S.P.|title=The Visigothic Code|url=http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/vg3-4.pdf|website=The Library of Iberian References Online|location=Book III, Title IV, Section VI}}</ref> Slaves' greater liability to physical punishment and judicial torture suggests their inferior social status in the eyes of Visigothic lawmakers.\n\nSlavery remained persistent in Christian Iberia after the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad invasions]] in the 8th century, and the Visigothic law codes continued to control slave ownership.  However, as William Phillips notes, medieval Iberia should not be thought of as a slave society, but rather as a society that owned slaves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=William|title=Slavery in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia|date=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=10}}</ref>   Slaves accounted for a relatively small percentage of the population, and did not make up a significant portion of the labor pool. Furthermore, while the existence of slavery continued from the earlier period, the use of slaves in post-Visigothic Christian Iberia differed from early periods.  Ian Wood has suggests that, under the Visigoths, the majority of the slave population lived and worked on rural estates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Ian|chapter=Social Relations in the Visigothic Kingdom from the Fifth to the Seventh Century|title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|date=1999|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|page=195}}</ref>  \n\nAfter the Muslim invasions, slave owners (especially in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]]) moved away from using slaves as field laborers or in work gangs, and did not press slaves into military service.<ref name=\"Phillips 19\">Phillips p.19</ref> Slaves tended to be owned singly rather than in large groups.

Slaves in Le\u00f3n and Castile were more likely to be employed as field laborers, supplanting free labor to support an aristocratic estate society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barton|first1=Simon|title=The Aristocracy of Twelfth-Century Leon and Castile|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=83}}</ref>  These trends in slave populations and use changed in the wake of the Black Death in 1348, which significantly increased the demand for slaves across the whole of the peninsula.<ref>Phillips p.21</ref>\n\nChristians were not the only slaveholders in Christian Iberia. Both Jews and Muslims living under Christian rule owned slaves, though more commonly in Aragon and Valencia than in Castile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Norman|title=Jews, Visigoths & Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict|date=1994|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|pages=160\u2013161}}</ref><ref>Phillips pp.20\u201321</ref> After the conquest of Valencia in 1245, the Kingdom of Aragon prohibited the possession of Christian slaves by Jews, though they were still permitted to hold Muslim or pagan slaves.<ref>Roth pp.156, 160</ref> The main role of Iberian Jews in the slave trade came as facilitators: Jews acted as slave brokers and agents of transfer between the Christian and Muslim kingdoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThis role caused some degree of fear among Christian populations.

Slaveholders in the Christian kingdoms gradually moved away from owning Christians, in accordance with Church proscriptions. In the middle of the medieval period most slaves in Christian Iberia were Muslim, either captured in battle with the Islamic states from the southern part of the peninsula, or taken from the eastern Mediterranean and imported into Iberia by merchants from cities such as [[Genoa]].<ref>Phillips p.61</ref>  \n\nThe Christian kingdoms of Iberia frequently traded their Muslim captives back across the border for payments of money or kind.  Indeed, historian James Broadman writes that this type of redemption offered the best chance for captives and slaves to regain their freedom.<ref>Broadman p.6</ref> The sale of Muslim captives, either back to the Islamic southern states or to third-party slave brokers, supplied one of the means by which Aragon and Castile financed the [[Reconquista]]. Battles and sieges provided large numbers of captives; after the siege of [[Almeria]] in 1147, sources report that [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]] sent almost 10,000 of the city's Muslim women and children to Genoa to be sold into slavery as partial repayment of Genoese assistance in the campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Jonathan|title=The Second Crusade: Extending the Frontiers of Christendom|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=260}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Callaghan|first1=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|date=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=140}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the Reconquista, however, this source of slaves became increasingly exhausted. Muslim rulers were increasingly unable to pay ransoms, and the Christian capture of large centers of population in the south made wholesale enslavement of Muslim populations impractical.<ref>Phillips pp.60\u201361</ref>  The loss of an Iberian Muslim source of slaves further encouraged Christians to look to other sources of manpower. Beginning with the first Portuguese slave raid in sub-Saharan Africa in 1411, the focus of slave importation began to shift from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic World, and the racial composition of slaves in Christian Iberia began to include an increasing number of black Africans.<ref>Blumenthal p.20</ref><ref>Saunders pp.5\u20137</ref>  \n\nBetween 1489 and 1497 almost 2,100 black slaves were shipped from Portugal to Valencia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lawrance|first1=Jeremey|authorlink1=Black Africans in Renaissance Spanish Literature|editor1-last=Earle|editor1-first=T.F.|editor2-last=Lowe|editor2-first=K.J.P.|title=Black Africans in Renaissance Europe|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=70|chapter=Black Africans in Renaissance Spanish Literature}}</ref><ref>Saunders p.29</ref> By the end of the 15th century, Spain held the largest population of black Africans in Europe, with a small, but growing community of black ex-slaves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lawrance p.70}}</ref>  In the mid 16th century Spain imported up to 2,000 black African slaves annually through Portugal, and by 1565 most of [[Seville|Seville's]] 6,327 slaves (out of a total population of 85,538) were black Africans.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>Saunders p.29</ref>\n\n==Slavery in Moldavia and Wallachia==\n{{main article|Slavery in Romania}}\nSlavery ({{lang-ro|robie, from Slavic rob, slave}}) existed on the territory of present-day [[Romania]] from before the founding of the principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] in the 13th&ndash;14th centuries, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. Particularly in Moldavia there were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Tatars|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nThe exact origins of slavery in the [[Danubian Principalities]] are not known. There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or as slaves. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] until their social organization was destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'.\n\nHistorian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the [[Mongols]] as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.<ref>Viorel Achim, The Roma in Romanian History, [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}</ref>\n\nWhile it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities, but the arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.<ref>\u015etefan \u015etef\u0103nescu, ''Istoria medie a Rom\u00e2niei'', Vol. I, Editura Universit\u0103\u0163ii din Bucure\u015fti, Bucharest, 1991 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\n==Slavery in the Medieval Near East==\n\nThe ancient and medieval [[Near East]] includes modern day Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, with strong connections to the rest of the north African coastline.

A kholop's master had unlimited power over his life:  he could kill him, sell him, or use him as payment upon a [[debt]]. The master, however, was responsible before the law for his kholop's actions. A person could become a kholop as a result of capture, selling himself or herself, being sold for debts or committed [[crime]]s, or marriage to a kholop. Until the late 10th century, the kholops represented a majority among the servants who worked lordly lands.\n\nBy the 16th century, slavery in [[Russia]] consisted mostly of those who sold themselves into slavery owing to poverty.<ref name=\"Richard Hellie 1984\">[[Richard Hellie]], ''Slavery in Russia, 1450\u20131725'' (1984)</ref>  They worked predominantly as household servants, among the richest families, and indeed generally produced less than they consumed.<ref>Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The [[Domostroy|Domostroi]]:  Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p15 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}</ref>  Laws forbade the freeing of slaves in times of famine, to avoid feeding them, and slaves generally remained with the family a long time; the ''[[Domostroy]]'', an advice book, speaks of the need to choose slaves of good character and to provide for them properly.<ref>Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The Domostroi:  Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p33 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}</ref>   Slavery remained a major institution in [[Russia]] until 1723, when [[Peter the Great]] converted the household slaves into house [[serfs]].

According to the Norwegian [[Gulating]] code (in about 1160), domestic slaves could not, unlike foreign slaves, be sold out of the country. This and other laws defined slaves as their master's property at the same level as cattle. It also described a procedure for giving a slave their freedom. A freed slave did not have full legal status; for example, the punishment for killing a former slave was low. A former slave's son also had a low status, but higher than that of his parents. The Norwegian law code from 1274, ''[[Landslov]]'' (Land's law), does not mention slaves, but former slaves. Thus it seems like slavery was abolished in Norway by this time. In Sweden, slavery was abolished in 1343.\n\n==Slavery in the British Isles==\n{{main article|Slavery in the British Isles}}\nBritish [[medieval Wales|Wales]] and Gaelic [[medieval Ireland (disambiguation)|Ireland]] and [[medieval Scotland|Scotland]] were among the last areas of Christian Europe to give up their institution of slavery. Under Gaelic custom, prisoners of war were routinely taken as slaves. During the period that slavery was disappearing across most of western Europe, it was reaching its height in the British Isles: the Viking invasions and the subsequent warring between Scandinavians and the natives, the number of captives taken as slaves drastically increased. The Irish church was vehemently opposed to slavery and blamed the 1169 [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] on divine punishment for the practice, along with local acceptance of [[polygyny]] and [[divorce]].\n\n==Serfdom versus slavery==\nIn considering how serfdom evolved from slavery, historians who study the divide between slavery and serfdom encounter several issues of [[historiography]] and methodology.  Some historians believe that slavery transitioned into serfdom (a view that has only been around for the last 200 years), though there is disagreement among them regarding how rapid this transition was.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=70\u201371}}</ref>   Pierre Bonnassie, a medieval historian, thought that the chattel slavery of the ancient world ceased to exist in the Europe of the 10th century and was followed by [[Feudalism|feudal]] serfdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=68}}</ref>   Jean-Pierre Devroey thinks that the shift from slavery to serfdom was gradual as well in some parts of the continent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Devroey|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Men and Women in Early Medieval Serfdom: the Ninth-Century North Frankish Evidence|journal=Past and Present|volume=166|date=2007|page=17|doi=10.1093/past/166.1.3}}</ref>   Other areas, though, did not have what he calls \"western-style serfdom\" after the end of slavery, such as the rural areas of the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Iceland]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|last1=Devroey|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Men and Women in Early Medieval Serfdom: The Ninth-Century North Frankish Evidence|journal=Past and Present|date=2000|volume=166|page=28|doi=10.1093/past/166.1.3}}</ref>   Complicating this issue is that regions in Europe often had both serfs and slaves simultaneously. In northwestern Europe, a transition from slavery to serfdom happened by the 12th century. The Catholic Church promoted the transformation by giving the example. Enslavement of fellow Catholics was prohibited in 992 and manumission was declared to be a pious act. However it remained legal to enslave people of other religions and dogmas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZW9DjTAox6EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|first=W.

Dominique Barth\u00e9lemy, among others, has questioned the very premises for neatly distinguishing serfdom from slavery, arguing that a binary classification masks the many shades of servitude.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=71}}</ref>  Of particular interest to historians is the role of serfdom and slavery within the state, and the implications that held for both serf and slave.  Some think that slavery was the exclusion of people from the public sphere and its institutions, whereas serfdom was a complex form of dependency that usually lacked a codified basis in the legal system.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=68\u201369}}</ref>  Wendy Davies argues that serfs, like slaves, also became excluded from the public judicial system and that judicial matters were attended to in the private courts of their respective lords.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Wendy|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=236\u2013238|chapter=On Servile Status in the Early Middle Ages}}</ref>\n\nDespite the scholarly disagreement, it is possible to piece together a general picture of slavery and serfdom.  Slaves typically owned no property, and were in fact the property of their masters.  Slaves worked full-time for their masters and operated under a negative [[Incentives|incentive structure]]; in other words, failure to work resulted in physical punishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=31\u201332|chapter=Slavery, Serfdom, and Other Forms of Coerced Labour: Similarities and Differences}}</ref>   Serfs held plots of land, which was essentially a form of \"payment\" that the lord offered in exchange for the serf's service.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=3|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>   Serfs worked part-time for the masters and part-time for themselves and had opportunities to accumulate personal wealth that often did not exist for the slave.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|pages=31\u201332|chapter=Slavery, Serfdom, and Other Forms of Coerced Labour: Similarities and Differences}}</ref>\n\nSlaves were generally imported from foreign countries or continents, brought to Europe via the [[slave trade]].  Serfs were typically indigenous Europeans and were not subject to the same involuntary movements as slaves.  Serfs worked in family units, whereas the concept of family was generally murkier for slaves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=2|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>  At any given moment, a slave's family could be torn apart via trade, and masters often used this threat to coerce compliant behavior from the slave.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|date=1996|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|pages=24\u201326|chapter=Slavery, serfdom and other forms of coerced labour: similarities and differences}}</ref>\n\nThe end of serfdom is also debated, with Georges Duby pointing to the early 12th century as a rough end point for \"serfdom in the strict sense of the term\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=79}}</ref>   Other historians dispute this assertion, citing discussions and the mention of serfdom as an institution during later dates (such as in 13th century [[England]], or in Central Europe, where the rise of serfdom coincided with its decline in Western Europe).  There are several approaches to get a time span for the transition, and [[lexicography]] is one such method.  There is supposedly a clear shift in diction when referencing those who were either slaves or serfs at approximately 1000, though there is not a consensus on how significant this shift is, or if it even exists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barth\u00e9lemy|first1=Dominique|title=The Serf the Knight and the Historian|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|page=69}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[numismatists]] shed light on the decline of serfdom.  There is a widespread theory that the introduction of currency hastened the decline of serfdom because it was preferable to pay for labor rather than depend on feudal obligations.  Some historians argue that landlords began selling serfs their land \u2013 and hence, their freedom \u2013 during periods of [[economic inflation]] across Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Michael|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=12|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>   Other historians argue that the end of slavery came from the royalty, who gave serfs freedom through edicts and legislation in an attempt to broaden their tax base.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engerman|first1=Stanley|title=Serfdom and Slavery: Studies in Legal Bondage|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Limited|location=London|page=38|chapter=Slavery, serfdom and other forms of coerced labour: similarities and differences}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of serfdom in some parts of medieval Europe raises several questions.  Devroey thinks it is because slavery was not born out of economic structures in these areas, but was rather a societal practice.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>  Heinrich Fichtenau points out that in Central Europe, there was not a labor market strong enough for slavery to become a necessity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fichtenau|first1=Heinrich|title=Living in the 10th century: Mentalities and Social Orders|date=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=372}}</ref>\n\n==Justifications for slavery==\nIn late Rome, the official attitude toward slavery was ambivalent. According to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's legal code]], slavery was defined as \"an institution according to the law of nations whereby one person falls under the [[property rights]] of another, contrary to nature\".<ref>David Graeber, ''Debt: The First 5000 Years'' (Brooklyn, New York: Melville House, 2011), ch. 7.</ref>\n\nJustifications for slavery throughout the medieval period were dominated by the perception of religious difference. Slaves were often outsiders taken in war. As such, Hebrew and Islamic thinking both conceived of the slave as an \"enemy within\".<ref>[[Orlando Patterson]], ''Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1982), pp. 40-41.</ref> In the Christian tradition, [[paganism|pagans]] and [[heretics]] were similarly considered enemies of the faith who could be justly enslaved. In theory, slaves who converted could embark on the path to freedom, but practices were inconsistent: masters were not obliged to [[manumission|manumit]] them and the practice of baptising slaves was often discouraged.<ref>Timothy Rayborn, ''The Violent Pilgrimage: Christians, Muslims and Holy Conflicts, 850\u20131150'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2013, p. 93.</ref> The enslavement of co-religionists was discouraged, if not forbidden, for Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. Consequently, northern European pagans and black Africans were a target for all three religious groups. Ethnic and religious difference were conflated in the justification of slavery.<ref name=\"Rayborn, p.93\">Rayborn, ''The Violent Pilgrimage'', p.93.</ref>\n\nA major Christian justification for the use of slavery, especially against those with dark skin, was the [[Curse of Ham]]. The Curse of Ham refers to a biblical parable ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209:20-27 Gen. 9:20\u201327]) in which [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], the son of [[Noah]], sins by seeing his father inebriated and naked, although scholars differ on the exact nature of Ham's transgression. Noah then curses Ham's offspring, [[Canaan]], with being a \"servant of servants unto his brethren\". Although race or skin color is not mentioned, many Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars began to interpret the passage as a curse of both slavery and black skin, in an attempt to justify the enslavement of people of color, specifically those of African descent.<ref>David M. Goldenberg, ''The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005).</ref> In the medieval period, however, it was also used by some Christians as a justification for serfdom. Muslim sources in the 7th century allude to the Curse of Ham gaining relevance as a justifying myth for the Islamic world's longstanding enslavement of Africans.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between the notion of human liberty founded in [[natural law]] and the recognition of slavery by [[canon law]] was resolved by a legal \"compromise\": enslavement was allowable given a just cause, which could then be defined by papal authority.<ref>Walter Ullmann, ''Medieval Papalism'' (Routledge, 1949), p. 57.</ref> The state of slavery was thought to be closely tied to [[original sin]].<ref>David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 92\u201394.</ref> Towards the middle of the 15th century, the [[Catholic Church and slavery|Catholic Church]], in particular the Papacy, took an active role in offering justifications for the enslavement of Saracens, pagans, Africans, and other \"infidels\". In 1452, a [[papal bull]] entitled [[Dum Diversas]] authorized [[Afonso V of Portugal|King Afonso V of Portugal]] to enslave any \"Saracens\" or \"pagans\" he encountered. The Pope, [[Pope Nicholas V]], recognized King Alfonso's military action as legitimate in the form of the papal bull, and declared the\n\n<blockquote>full and free power, through the Apostolic authority by this edict, to invade, conquer, fight, and subjugate the Saracens and pagans, and other infidels and other enemies of Christ, and ... to reduce their persons into perpetual servitude ...<ref>Pope Nicholas V, \"Dum diversas\" (1452), in ''Bullarium patronatus Portugalliae regum in ecclesiis Africae, Asiae atque Oceaniae'' (1868) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA22&dq=%22in%20perpetuam%20servitutem%22 p.&nbsp;22.]</ref><ref>Pope Nicholas V (1452), \"Dum Diversas (English Translation)\", ''Unam Sanctam Catholicam'', February 5, 2011. http://unamsanctamcatholicam.blogspot.com/2011/02/dum-diversas-english-translation.html.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a follow-up bull, released in 1455 and entitled [[Romanus Pontifex]], Pope Nicholas V reiterated his support for the enslavement of infidels in the context of Portugal's monopoly on North African trade routes.<ref>Frances Gardiner Davenport, ''European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648'' (Washington, D.C.), pp. 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nHistorians such as Timothy Rayborn have contended that religious justifications served to mask the economic necessities underlying the institution of slavery.<ref name=\"Rayborn, p.93\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arab slave trade]]\n* [[Christianity and slavery]]\n* [[Catholic Church and slavery]]\n* [[History of slavery]]\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Slavery in ancient Greece]]\n* [[Slavery in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Slavery in antiquity]]\n* [[The Bible and slavery]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Campbell, Gwyn ''et al.'' eds.

In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a [[herbicide]]), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop.

To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, resulting in a proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level ([[crown gall]]). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment ([[plasmid]]). When ''Agrobacterium'' infects a plant, it transfers this [[Ti plasmid|T-DNA]] to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA is removed from the bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for [[dicotyledon]]ous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco.

This randomizes which genes get propagated to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year. Typically, the seed company maintains two [[inbred]] varieties and crosses them into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] strain that is then sold. Related plants like [[sorghum]] and gamma grass are able to perform [[apomixis]], a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact. This trait is apparently controlled by a single dominant gene, but traditional breeding has been unsuccessful in creating asexually-reproducing maize. Genetic engineering offers another route to this goal. Successful modification would allow farmers to replant harvested seeds that retain desirable traits, rather than relying on purchased seed.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 March 2003|periodical=[[Technology Review]]|author=Daniel Charles|title=Corn That Clones Itself|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401826/corn-that-clones-itself/}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\nGenetic modifications to some crops also exist, which make it easier to process the crop, i.e. by growing in a more compact form.<ref>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0361-2 Rapid customization of Solanaceae fruit crops for urban agriculture]</ref> Also, some crops (such as tomatoes) have been genetic modified to contain no seed at all.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127640-gene-editing-opens-doors-to-seedless-fruit-with-no-need-for-bees/ Gene editing opens doors to seedless fruit with no need for bees]</ref>\n\n==Crops==\n{{see also|List of genetically modified crops}}\n\n===Herbicide tolerance===\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n!

Releases were approved for herbicide tolerance (6,772 releases), insect resistance (4,809), product quality such as flavor or nutrition (4,896), agronomic properties like drought resistance (5,190), and virus/fungal resistance (2,616). The institutions with the most authorized field releases include Monsanto with 6,782, Pioneer/DuPont with 1,405, Syngenta with 565, and USDA's Agricultural Research Service with 370.

Insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any (recessive) resistance genes are diluted within the population. Resistance lowers evolutionary fitness in the absence of the stressor, Bt.

By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. [[Palmer amaranth]] is a weed that competes with cotton.

Insecticide use on corn farms declined from 0.21 pound per planted acre in 1995 to 0.02 pound in 2010. This is consistent with the decline in [[European corn borer]] populations as a direct result of Bt corn and cotton. The establishment of minimum refuge requirements helped delay the evolution of Bt resistance. However, resistance appears to be developing to some Bt traits in some areas.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n===Tillage===\nBy leaving at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface from harvest through planting, [[conservation tillage]] reduces soil erosion from wind and water, increases water retention, and reduces [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] as well as water and chemical runoff.

There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.

For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.<ref name=\"HighPlainsJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=Hpj.com |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then invest time, fuel, and equipment in applying them.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, resulting in a proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level ([[crown gall]]). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment ([[plasmid]]). When ''Agrobacterium'' infects a plant, it transfers this [[Ti plasmid|T-DNA]] to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA is removed from the bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene.

This randomizes which genes get propagated to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year. Typically, the seed company maintains two [[inbred]] varieties and crosses them into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] strain that is then sold. Related plants like [[sorghum]] and gamma grass are able to perform [[apomixis]], a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact. This trait is apparently controlled by a single dominant gene, but traditional breeding has been unsuccessful in creating asexually-reproducing maize. Genetic engineering offers another route to this goal. Successful modification would allow farmers to replant harvested seeds that retain desirable traits, rather than relying on purchased seed.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 March 2003|periodical=[[Technology Review]]|author=Daniel Charles|title=Corn That Clones Itself|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401826/corn-that-clones-itself/}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\nGenetic modifications to some crops also exist, which make it easier to process the crop, i.e. by growing in a more compact form.<ref>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0361-2 Rapid customization of Solanaceae fruit crops for urban agriculture]</ref> Also, some crops (such as tomatoes) have been genetic modified to contain no seed at all.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127640-gene-editing-opens-doors-to-seedless-fruit-with-no-need-for-bees/ Gene editing opens doors to seedless fruit with no need for bees]</ref>\n\n==Crops==\n{{see also|List of genetically modified crops}}\n\n===Herbicide tolerance===\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n!

Insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any (recessive) resistance genes are diluted within the population. Resistance lowers evolutionary fitness in the absence of the stressor, Bt. In refuges, non-resistant strains outcompete resistant ones.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tabashnik |display-authors=etal | year = 2003 | title = Insect Resistance to Transgenic Bt Crops: Lessons from the Laboratory and Field | url = http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf | journal = J.

By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. [[Palmer amaranth]] is a weed that competes with cotton.

Insecticide use on corn farms declined from 0.21 pound per planted acre in 1995 to 0.02 pound in 2010. This is consistent with the decline in [[European corn borer]] populations as a direct result of Bt corn and cotton. The establishment of minimum refuge requirements helped delay the evolution of Bt resistance. However, resistance appears to be developing to some Bt traits in some areas.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n===Tillage===\nBy leaving at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface from harvest through planting, [[conservation tillage]] reduces soil erosion from wind and water, increases water retention, and reduces [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] as well as water and chemical runoff.

There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.

For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.<ref name=\"HighPlainsJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=Hpj.com |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then invest time, fuel, and equipment in applying them.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis.<br><br/>Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.<br><br/>The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations.
