The battle took place in the vicinity of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], in the Roman province of [[Thrace|Thracia]] (modern [[Edirne]] in [[East Thrace|European Turkey]]). It ended with an overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\">Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', book 4.</ref>\n\nPart of the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)]], the battle is often considered the start of the process which led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century.\n\nA detailed contemporary account of the lead-up to the battle from the Roman perspective was written by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and forms the culminating point at the end of his history.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 12\u201314.</ref> \n\n==Background==\nIn 376, displaced by the invasions of the [[Huns]], the [[Goths]], led by [[Alavivus]] and Fritigern, asked to be allowed to settle in the Eastern Roman Empire. Hoping that they would become farmers and soldiers, the Eastern Roman emperor [[Valens]] allowed them to establish themselves in the Empire as allies ([[foederati]]). However, once across the [[Danube]] (and in Roman territory), the dishonesty of the provincial commanders [[Lupicinus (Roman)|Lupicinus]] and Maximus led the newcomers to revolt after suffering many hardships. Valens (of the Eastern Empire) then asked [[Gratian]], the western emperor, for reinforcements to fight the Goths. Gratian sent the general [[Frigeridus (general)|Frigeridus]] with reinforcements, as well as the leader of his guards, [[Richomeres]]. For the next two years preceding the battle of Adrianople there were a series of running battles with no clear victories for either side.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 3\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn 378, Valens decided to take control himself. Valens would bring more troops from [[Syria]] and Gratian would bring more troops from [[Gaul]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 7\u201311.</ref>\n\nValens left [[Antioch]] for [[Constantinople]], and arrived on the 30th of May. He appointed [[Sebastianus (Roman general)|Sebastianus]], newly arrived from Italy, to reorganize the Roman armies already in [[Thrace]]. Sebastianus picked 2,000 of his [[legionaries]] and marched towards Adrianople. They ambushed some small Gothic detachments. Fritigern assembled the Gothic forces at [[Nicopolis ad Istrum|Nicopolis]] and [[Stara Zagora|Beroe]] (now [[Stara Zagora]]) to deal with this Roman threat.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\" /><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 11.</ref><ref>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 1, chapter 38.</ref>\n\nGratian had sent much of his army to [[Pannonia]] when the [[Lentienses]] (part of the [[Alamanni]]) attacked across the [[Rhine]]. Gratian recalled his army and defeated the Lentienses near Argentaria (near modern-day [[Colmar]], France.) After this campaign, Gratian, with part of his field army, went east by boat; the rest of his field army went east overland. The former group arrived at [[Sirmium]] in Pannonia and at the Camp of Mars (a fort near the [[Iron Gates]]), 400 kilometers from Adrianople, where some Alans attacked them. Gratian's group withdrew to Pannonia shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\" /><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAfter learning of Sebastian's success against the Goths, and of Gratian's victory over the Alamanni, Valens was more than ready for a victory of his own. He brought his army from [[Melantias]] to Adrianople, where he met with Sebastian's force. On 6 August, reconnaissance informed Valens that about 10,000 Goths were marching towards Adrianople from the north, about 25 kilometers away. Despite the difficult ground, Valens reached Adrianople where the Roman army fortified its camp with ditch and rampart.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 12.</ref>\n\nRichomeres, sent by Gratian, carried a letter asking Valens to wait for the arrival of reinforcements from Gratian before engaging in battle. Valens' officers also recommended that he wait for Gratian, but Valens decided to fight without waiting, ready to claim the ultimate prize.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" />\n\nThe Goths were also watching the Romans, and on 8 August, Fritigern sent an emissary to propose a peace and an alliance in exchange for some Roman territory. Sure that he would be victorious due to his supposed numerical superiority, Valens rejected these proposals.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" /> However, his estimates did not take into consideration a part of the Gothic cavalry that had gone to forage further away.<ref name=\"Roman Empire\">[http://www.roman-empire.net/army/adrianople.html Roman Empire \u2013 Adrianople] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329073239/http://www.roman-empire.net/army/adrianople.html |date=29 March 2007 }} roman-empire.net.

The cavalry was composed of mounted archers (''sagittarii'') and ''[[Scholae Palatinae|Scholae]]'' (the imperial guard). However, these attacked precipitately, while peace negotiations were going on, and precipitately fled. There were also squadrons of Arab cavalry, but they were more suited to skirmishes than to pitched battle. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n[[File:Germaniciani seniores shield pattern.svg|thumb|200px|Shield pattern of the ''Germaniciani seniores'', according to ''[[Notitia dignitatum]]''.]]\n\nAmmianus Marcellinus makes references to the following forces under Valens:\n* Legions of ''Lanciarii'', and ''Mattiarii''.

Some{{who|date=November 2012}} claim that the Mattiarii may have been allied forces.{{dubious|date=November 2012}}{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, ''mattiarii'' may refer to mace-armed infantry (''mattea'' being Latin for mace).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Valens is referred to as seeking protection with the Lanciarii and Mattiarii as the other Roman forces collapsed (apparently a sign of how desperate the battle had become).

As one or both were under the command of [[Bacurius the Iberian]], these may have been allied auxiliary troops from [[Caucasian Iberia]] (part of modern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) rather than Roman.\n\nHe also refers to the following officers:\n* Ricimer ([[Richomeres]]), Frankish ''[[Comes]]'' of Gratian's ''Domestici'' (the corps of bodyguards of the emperor who were stationed in the imperial palace) sent to assist Valens in 376. He offered to act as a hostage to facilitate negotiations when Equitus refused. He survived the battle, indicated due to retreating.\n* [[Sebastianus (Roman general)|Sebastianus]], arrived from Italy previously, and clearly operating as one of Valens' generals. Killed in the battle.\n* Victor, [[magister equitum|master-general of the cavalry]], a [[Sarmatia]]n by birth, who led the officers counselling waiting for Gratian.\n* [[Equitius (soldier)|Equitius]], a relation of Valens, a tribune and high steward of the palace. He refused to act as a hostage, as he had been a prisoner of the Goths in Dibaltum and escaped, and now feared revenge. Killed in the battle.\n* [[Bacurius the Iberian|Bacurius]] (presumably Romanised Bakur), a native and possibly prince of Iberia, in command of the archers and/or ''scutarii'' with Cassio that accompanied Ricimer as hostage, and who attacked without orders.\n* [[Traianus (magister peditum)|Traianus]], apparently in command of Roman forces before Valens assumed command, who was described as an illustrious man whose death in the battle was a great loss.

The only sources are Ammianus, who describes the battle but mentions few units by name, and the eastern [[Notitia Dignitatum]], which lists Roman army units in the late 4th to early 5th century, after [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]. Many units listed in the Balkans were formed after Adrianople; others were transferred from other parts of the Empire, before or after Adrianople; others are listed in two or more sectors. Some units at Adrianople may have been merged or disbanded due to their losses. The Roman forces consisted of heavy infantry, various archers and cavalry.<ref>Simon Macdowall, ''Adrianople Ad 378'', Osprey Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-147-8}}</ref>\n\n==Composition of the Gothic forces==\n{{See also|Gothic and Vandal warfare}}\nThere were probably two main Gothic armies south of the Danube. Fritigern led one army, largely recruited from the Therving exiles, while Alatheus and Saphrax led another army, largely recruited from the Greuthung exiles.\nFritigern brought most if not all of his fighters to the battle, and appears to have led the force the Romans first encountered. Alatheus and Saphrax brought their cavalry into action \"descending like a thunderbolt\" against the Romans. These forces included Alans.\n\nThe Gothic armies were mostly infantry, with some cavalry, which was significant in the battle of Adrianople.\nSome older works{{which|date=February 2019}} attribute the Gothic victory to overwhelming Gothic numbers, to Gothic cavalry, and sometimes to Gothic use of stirrups.<ref>Asimov, Isaac., 1991, \"Asimov's Chronology of the World\", pp. 102\u201305, \"350 to 400 CE\"</ref> \nMore recent scholarly works mostly agree that the armies were similarly sized, that the Gothic infantry was more decisive than their cavalry, and that neither the Romans nor the Goths used stirrups until the 6th century,<ref name=\"Bishop, M.C. 2006, p.123\">Bishop, M.C., and Coulston, J.C.N., 2006, ''Roman Military Equipment: From the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome,'' p. 123.</ref><ref name=\"Bishop, M.C. 2006, p.123\"/> probably brought by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]].<ref>McGeer, Eric, 2008, ''Sowing the Dragon's Teeth: Byzantine Warfare in the Tenth Century,'' p. 211.</ref>\n\nAmmianus records that the Roman scouts estimated 10,000 Gothic troops; but Ammianus dismissed this as an underestimate.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" /> This appears to be due to Alatheus and Saphrax's forces being away when the Roman scouts estimated the Goths' numbers before battle. Several modern historians have estimated the strength of the Gothic armies at 12,000\u201315,000.<ref>Delbr\u00fcck, Hans, (trans. Renfroe, Walter), 1980, ''The Barbarian Invasions'', Lincoln & London, University of Nebraska Press, p. 276.</ref>\n\nAmmianus notes the important role of the Gothic cavalry. [[Charles Oman]], believing that the cavalry were the majority of the Gothic force, interpreted the Battle of Adrianople as the beginning of the dominance of cavalry over infantry for the next thousand years.<ref>Oman, C.W.C., 1953, ''The Art of War in the Middle Ages'', pp. 5\u20136</ref> Some other historians have taken the same view.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Paul|title=100 Decisive Battles|year=1999|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-514366-9|pages=83\u201386}}</ref> Burns and other recent historians argue that the infantry were the vast majority of the Gothic force, and that the battle had little effect on the relationship between infantry and cavalry.<ref>Macdowall, Simon, 2001, ''Adrianople AD 378: The Goths Crush Rome's Legions'', p. 88</ref>\n\n==Location==\nThe battle took place within a few hours' march of the city of [[Adrianopolis]], but its precise location is uncertain.\nThree possible locations of the battle have been discussed in modern historiography:\n*One thesis suggests that the Gothic camp and the battleground were located to the north of [[Adrianopolis]], west of the [[Tundja River|Tonzos river]] but east of [[Hebros]] river ({{coor|41.81|N|26.50|E|}}).<ref>{{cite book|author=John Curran|title=''Cambridge Ancient History''|volume=13|page=100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Zosime|title=''Histoire Nouvelle, text, translation, and commentary by Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud''|publisher=Belle Lettres|volume=2 part 22|page=382|language=fr}}, while Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud cites the notable German historian [[Otto Seeck]].</ref> \n*Another locates the battlefield again north of the city, but east of [[Tundja River|Tonzos river]], near the contemporary Turkish village of Murat\u00e7al\u0131 ({{coor|41.81|N|26.60|E|}}).<ref>{{cite book|author=Simon MacDowall|title=''Adrianople AD 378: The Goths Crush Rome's Legions''|publisher=Osprey|year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=D.S.

The reconnaissance of the preceding days informed him of the location of the Gothic camp north of the city. Valens arrived there around noon after marching for eight miles over difficult terrain.<ref>\n\"Then, having traversed the broken ground which divided the two armies, as the burning day was progressing towards noon, at last, after marching eight miles, our men came in sight of the wagons of the enemy, which had been stated by the scouts to be all arranged in a circle.\"  trans. C. D. Yonge (1911).\n</ref>\n\nThe Roman troops arrived tired and dehydrated, facing the Gothic camp that had been set up on the top of a hill. The Goths, except for their cavalry, defended their wagon circle, inside of which were their families and possessions. Fritigern's objective was to delay the Romans, in order to give enough time for the Gothic cavalry to return. The fields were burnt by the Goths to delay and harass the Romans with smoke, and negotiations began for an exchange of hostages. The negotiations exasperated the Roman soldiers who seemed to hold the stronger position, but they gained precious time for Fritigern.\n\nSome Roman units began the battle without orders to do so, believing they would have an easy victory, and perhaps over-eager to exact revenge on the Goths after two years of unchecked devastation throughout the Balkans. The imperial scholae of shield-archers under the command of the [[Transcaucasian Iberia|Iberian]] prince [[Bacurius the Iberian|Bacurius]] attacked, but lacking support they were easily pushed back. Then the Roman left-wing reached the [[circle the wagons|circle of wagons]], but it was too late. At that moment, the Gothic cavalry, returning from a foraging expedition, arrived to support the infantry. The cavalry surrounded the Roman troops, who were already in disarray after the failure of the first assault. The Romans retreated to the base of the hill where they were unable to maneuver, encumbered by their heavy armor and long shields. The casualties, exhaustion, and psychological pressure led to a [[rout]] of the Roman army. The cavalry continued their attack, and the killing continued until nightfall.\n\nIn the rout, the Emperor himself was abandoned by his guards. Some tried to retrieve him, but the majority of the cavalry fled. Valens' final fate is unknown; he may have died anonymously on the field. His body was never found. An alternative story circulated after the battle that Valens had escaped the field with a bodyguard and some eunuchs, and hid in a peasant's cottage. The enemy attempted to pillage the cottage, apparently unaware Valens was inside. Valens' men shot arrows from the second floor to defend the cottage and in response the Goths set the cottage on fire. The bodyguard leaped out the window and told the Goths who was inside, but it was too late. Valens perished in the flames.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 13.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to the [[historian]] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], the Goths immediately marched to the city of Adrianople and attempted to take it; Ammianus gives a detailed account of their failure. Ammianus refers to a great number of Roman soldiers who had not been let into the city and who fought the besieging Goths below the walls. A third of the Roman army succeeded in retreating, but the losses were uncountable. Many officers, among them the general Sebastian, were killed in the worst Roman defeat since the [[Battle of Edessa]], the high point of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The battle was a significant blow for the late Empire, resulting in the destruction of the core army of the eastern Empire, the deaths of valuable administrators, and the destruction of all of the arms factories on the Danube following the battle. The lack of reserves for the army worsened the recruitment crisis. Despite the losses, the battle of Adrianople did not mark the end of the Roman Empire because the imperial military power was only temporarily crippled.\n\nThe defeat at Adrianople signified that the barbarians, fighting for or against the Romans, had become powerful adversaries. The Goths, though partly tamed by Valens' successor [[Theodosius I]] (who accepted them once more as allies), were never expelled, exterminated, or assimilated; they remained as a distinct entity within its frontiers, for a few years allies, later independent and often hostile.\n\nThe long-term implications of the battle of Adrianople for the art of war have often been overstated, with many 20th-century writers repeating Sir [[Charles Oman]]'s idea<ref>Charles Oman, ''Art of War in the Middle Ages'', Cornell University Press, 1960, {{ISBN|0-8014-9062-6}}</ref> that the battle represented a turning point in military history, with heavy cavalry triumphing over Roman infantry and ushering in the age of the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[knight]]. This idea was overturned by T. S. Burns in 1973.<ref>T. S. Burns, \u2018The Battle of Adrianople, a reconsideration\u2019, Historia, xxii (1973), pp. 336\u201345</ref> Burns shows that the Gothic army's cavalry arm was fairly small, that Valens would actually have had more cavalry and that while the role of Fritigern's cavalry was critical to his victory, the battle was a mainly infantry versus infantry affair. The Medieval knight was not to rise for several centuries after Adrianople. It is also often stated that the defeat at Adrianople led to changes in the composition of the late Roman Army and an increase in the use of cavalry. In fact, this process had been going on in the Roman Army long before 378, with cavalry increasing its role and status in the Army from at least the time of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253 to 260 CE).{{fact}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n* [[Alessandro Barbero]] (2007).

The battle took place in the vicinity of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], in the Roman province of [[Thrace|Thracia]] (modern [[Edirne]] in [[East Thrace|European Turkey]]). It ended with an overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\">Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', book 4.</ref>\n\nPart of the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)]], the battle is often considered the start of the process which led to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century.\n\nA detailed contemporary account of the lead-up to the battle from the Roman perspective was written by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and forms the culminating point at the end of his history.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 12\u201314.</ref> \n\n==Background==\nIn 376, displaced by the invasions of the [[Huns]], the [[Goths]], led by [[Alavivus]] and Fritigern, asked to be allowed to settle in the Eastern Roman Empire. Hoping that they would become farmers and soldiers, the Eastern Roman emperor [[Valens]] allowed them to establish themselves in the Empire as allies ([[foederati]]). However, once across the [[Danube]] (and in Roman territory), the dishonesty of the provincial commanders [[Lupicinus (Roman)|Lupicinus]] and Maximus led the newcomers to revolt after suffering many hardships. Valens (of the Eastern Empire) then asked [[Gratian]], the western emperor, for reinforcements to fight the Goths. Gratian sent the general [[Frigeridus (general)|Frigeridus]] with reinforcements, as well as the leader of his guards, [[Richomeres]]. For the next two years preceding the battle of Adrianople there were a series of running battles with no clear victories for either side.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 3\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn 378, Valens decided to take control himself. Valens would bring more troops from [[Syria]] and Gratian would bring more troops from [[Gaul]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 7\u201311.</ref>\n\nValens left [[Antioch]] for [[Constantinople]], and arrived on the 30th of May. He appointed [[Sebastianus (Roman general)|Sebastianus]], newly arrived from Italy, to reorganize the Roman armies already in [[Thrace]]. Sebastianus picked 2,000 of his [[legionaries]] and marched towards Adrianople. They ambushed some small Gothic detachments. Fritigern assembled the Gothic forces at [[Nicopolis ad Istrum|Nicopolis]] and [[Stara Zagora|Beroe]] (now [[Stara Zagora]]) to deal with this Roman threat.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\" /><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 11.</ref><ref>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 1, chapter 38.</ref>\n\nGratian had sent much of his army to [[Pannonia]] when the [[Lentienses]] (part of the [[Alamanni]]) attacked across the [[Rhine]]. Gratian recalled his army and defeated the Lentienses near Argentaria (near modern-day [[Colmar]], France.) After this campaign, Gratian, with part of his field army, went east by boat; the rest of his field army went east overland. The former group arrived at [[Sirmium]] in Pannonia and at the Camp of Mars (a fort near the [[Iron Gates]]), 400 kilometers from Adrianople, where some Alans attacked them. Gratian's group withdrew to Pannonia shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Historia Nova book 4\" /><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAfter learning of Sebastian's success against the Goths, and of Gratian's victory over the Alamanni, Valens was more than ready for a victory of his own. He brought his army from [[Melantias]] to Adrianople, where he met with Sebastian's force. On 6 August, reconnaissance informed Valens that about 10,000 Goths were marching towards Adrianople from the north, about 25 kilometers away. Despite the difficult ground, Valens reached Adrianople where the Roman army fortified its camp with ditch and rampart.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 12.</ref>\n\nRichomeres, sent by Gratian, carried a letter asking Valens to wait for the arrival of reinforcements from Gratian before engaging in battle. Valens' officers also recommended that he wait for Gratian, but Valens decided to fight without waiting, ready to claim the ultimate prize.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" />\n\nThe Goths were also watching the Romans, and on 8 August, Fritigern sent an emissary to propose a peace and an alliance in exchange for some Roman territory. Sure that he would be victorious due to his supposed numerical superiority, Valens rejected these proposals.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" /> However, his estimates did not take into consideration a part of the Gothic cavalry that had gone to forage further away.<ref name=\"Roman Empire\">[http://www.roman-empire.net/army/adrianople.html Roman Empire \u2013 Adrianople] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329073239/http://www.roman-empire.net/army/adrianople.html |date=29 March 2007 }} roman-empire.net.

The cavalry was composed of mounted archers (''sagittarii'') and ''[[Scholae Palatinae|Scholae]]'' (the imperial guard). However, these attacked precipitately, while peace negotiations were going on, and precipitately fled. There were also squadrons of Arab cavalry, but they were more suited to skirmishes than to pitched battle. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n[[File:Germaniciani seniores shield pattern.svg|thumb|200px|Shield pattern of the ''Germaniciani seniores'', according to ''[[Notitia dignitatum]]''.]]\n\nAmmianus Marcellinus makes references to the following forces under Valens:\n* Legions of ''Lanciarii'', and ''Mattiarii''.

Some{{who|date=November 2012}} claim that the Mattiarii may have been allied forces.{{dubious|date=November 2012}}{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, ''mattiarii'' may refer to mace-armed infantry (''mattea'' being Latin for mace).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Valens is referred to as seeking protection with the Lanciarii and Mattiarii as the other Roman forces collapsed (apparently a sign of how desperate the battle had become).

Killed in the battle.\n* Victor, [[magister equitum|master-general of the cavalry]], a [[Sarmatia]]n by birth, who led the officers counselling waiting for Gratian.\n* [[Equitius (soldier)|Equitius]], a relation of Valens, a tribune and high steward of the palace. He refused to act as a hostage, as he had been a prisoner of the Goths in Dibaltum and escaped, and now feared revenge. Killed in the battle.\n* [[Bacurius the Iberian|Bacurius]] (presumably Romanised Bakur), a native and possibly prince of Iberia, in command of the archers and/or ''scutarii'' with Cassio that accompanied Ricimer as hostage, and who attacked without orders.\n* [[Traianus (magister peditum)|Traianus]], apparently in command of Roman forces before Valens assumed command, who was described as an illustrious man whose death in the battle was a great loss.

The only sources are Ammianus, who describes the battle but mentions few units by name, and the eastern [[Notitia Dignitatum]], which lists Roman army units in the late 4th to early 5th century, after [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]. Many units listed in the Balkans were formed after Adrianople; others were transferred from other parts of the Empire, before or after Adrianople; others are listed in two or more sectors. Some units at Adrianople may have been merged or disbanded due to their losses. The Roman forces consisted of heavy infantry, various archers and cavalry.<ref>Simon Macdowall, ''Adrianople Ad 378'', Osprey Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-147-8}}</ref>\n\n==Composition of the Gothic forces==\n{{See also|Gothic and Vandal warfare}}\nThere were probably two main Gothic armies south of the Danube. Fritigern led one army, largely recruited from the Therving exiles, while Alatheus and Saphrax led another army, largely recruited from the Greuthung exiles.\nFritigern brought most if not all of his fighters to the battle, and appears to have led the force the Romans first encountered. Alatheus and Saphrax brought their cavalry into action \"descending like a thunderbolt\" against the Romans. These forces included Alans.\n\nThe Gothic armies were mostly infantry, with some cavalry, which was significant in the battle of Adrianople.\nSome older works{{which|date=February 2019}} attribute the Gothic victory to overwhelming Gothic numbers, to Gothic cavalry, and sometimes to Gothic use of stirrups.<ref>Asimov, Isaac., 1991, \"Asimov's Chronology of the World\", pp. 102\u201305, \"350 to 400 CE\"</ref> \nMore recent scholarly works mostly agree that the armies were similarly sized, that the Gothic infantry was more decisive than their cavalry, and that neither the Romans nor the Goths used stirrups until the 6th century,<ref name=\"Bishop, M.C. 2006, p.123\">Bishop, M.C., and Coulston, J.C.N., 2006, ''Roman Military Equipment: From the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome,'' p. 123.</ref><ref name=\"Bishop, M.C. 2006, p.123\"/> probably brought by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]].<ref>McGeer, Eric, 2008, ''Sowing the Dragon's Teeth: Byzantine Warfare in the Tenth Century,'' p. 211.</ref>\n\nAmmianus records that the Roman scouts estimated 10,000 Gothic troops; but Ammianus dismissed this as an underestimate.<ref name=\"Marcellinus Chapter 12\" /> This appears to be due to Alatheus and Saphrax's forces being away when the Roman scouts estimated the Goths' numbers before battle. Several modern historians have estimated the strength of the Gothic armies at 12,000\u201315,000.<ref>Delbr\u00fcck, Hans, (trans. Renfroe, Walter), 1980, ''The Barbarian Invasions'', Lincoln & London, University of Nebraska Press, p. 276.</ref>\n\nAmmianus notes the important role of the Gothic cavalry. [[Charles Oman]], believing that the cavalry were the majority of the Gothic force, interpreted the Battle of Adrianople as the beginning of the dominance of cavalry over infantry for the next thousand years.<ref>Oman, C.W.C., 1953, ''The Art of War in the Middle Ages'', pp. 5\u20136</ref> Some other historians have taken the same view.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Paul|title=100 Decisive Battles|year=1999|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-514366-9|pages=83\u201386}}</ref> Burns and other recent historians argue that the infantry were the vast majority of the Gothic force, and that the battle had little effect on the relationship between infantry and cavalry.<ref>Macdowall, Simon, 2001, ''Adrianople AD 378: The Goths Crush Rome's Legions'', p. 88</ref>\n\n==Location==\nThe battle took place within a few hours' march of the city of [[Adrianopolis]], but its precise location is uncertain.\nThree possible locations of the battle have been discussed in modern historiography:\n*One thesis suggests that the Gothic camp and the battleground were located to the north of [[Adrianopolis]], west of the [[Tundja River|Tonzos river]] but east of [[Hebros]] river ({{coor|41.81|N|26.50|E|}}).<ref>{{cite book|author=John Curran|title=''Cambridge Ancient History''|volume=13|page=100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Zosime|title=''Histoire Nouvelle, text, translation, and commentary by Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud''|publisher=Belle Lettres|volume=2 part 22|page=382|language=fr}}, while Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud cites the notable German historian [[Otto Seeck]].</ref> \n*Another locates the battlefield again north of the city, but east of [[Tundja River|Tonzos river]], near the contemporary Turkish village of Murat\u00e7al\u0131 ({{coor|41.81|N|26.60|E|}}).<ref>{{cite book|author=Simon MacDowall|title=''Adrianople AD 378: The Goths Crush Rome's Legions''|publisher=Osprey|year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=D.S.

The reconnaissance of the preceding days informed him of the location of the Gothic camp north of the city. Valens arrived there around noon after marching for eight miles over difficult terrain.<ref>\n\"Then, having traversed the broken ground which divided the two armies, as the burning day was progressing towards noon, at last, after marching eight miles, our men came in sight of the wagons of the enemy, which had been stated by the scouts to be all arranged in a circle.\"  trans. C. D. Yonge (1911).\n</ref>\n\nThe Roman troops arrived tired and dehydrated, facing the Gothic camp that had been set up on the top of a hill. The Goths, except for their cavalry, defended their wagon circle, inside of which were their families and possessions. Fritigern's objective was to delay the Romans, in order to give enough time for the Gothic cavalry to return. The fields were burnt by the Goths to delay and harass the Romans with smoke, and negotiations began for an exchange of hostages. The negotiations exasperated the Roman soldiers who seemed to hold the stronger position, but they gained precious time for Fritigern.\n\nSome Roman units began the battle without orders to do so, believing they would have an easy victory, and perhaps over-eager to exact revenge on the Goths after two years of unchecked devastation throughout the Balkans. The imperial scholae of shield-archers under the command of the [[Transcaucasian Iberia|Iberian]] prince [[Bacurius the Iberian|Bacurius]] attacked, but lacking support they were easily pushed back. Then the Roman left-wing reached the [[circle the wagons|circle of wagons]], but it was too late. At that moment, the Gothic cavalry, returning from a foraging expedition, arrived to support the infantry. The cavalry surrounded the Roman troops, who were already in disarray after the failure of the first assault. The Romans retreated to the base of the hill where they were unable to maneuver, encumbered by their heavy armor and long shields. The casualties, exhaustion, and psychological pressure led to a [[rout]] of the Roman army. The cavalry continued their attack, and the killing continued until nightfall.\n\nIn the rout, the Emperor himself was abandoned by his guards. Some tried to retrieve him, but the majority of the cavalry fled. Valens' final fate is unknown; he may have died anonymously on the field. His body was never found. An alternative story circulated after the battle that Valens had escaped the field with a bodyguard and some eunuchs, and hid in a peasant's cottage. The enemy attempted to pillage the cottage, apparently unaware Valens was inside. Valens' men shot arrows from the second floor to defend the cottage and in response the Goths set the cottage on fire. The bodyguard leaped out the window and told the Goths who was inside, but it was too late. Valens perished in the flames.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapter 13.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to the [[historian]] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], the Goths immediately marched to the city of Adrianople and attempted to take it; Ammianus gives a detailed account of their failure. Ammianus refers to a great number of Roman soldiers who had not been let into the city and who fought the besieging Goths below the walls. A third of the Roman army succeeded in retreating, but the losses were uncountable. Many officers, among them the general Sebastian, were killed in the worst Roman defeat since the [[Battle of Edessa]], the high point of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The battle was a significant blow for the late Empire, resulting in the destruction of the core army of the eastern Empire, the deaths of valuable administrators, and the destruction of all of the arms factories on the Danube following the battle. The lack of reserves for the army worsened the recruitment crisis. Despite the losses, the battle of Adrianople did not mark the end of the Roman Empire because the imperial military power was only temporarily crippled.\n\nThe defeat at Adrianople signified that the barbarians, fighting for or against the Romans, had become powerful adversaries. The Goths, though partly tamed by Valens' successor [[Theodosius I]] (who accepted them once more as allies), were never expelled, exterminated, or assimilated; they remained as a distinct entity within its frontiers, for a few years allies, later independent and often hostile.\n\nThe long-term implications of the battle of Adrianople for the art of war have often been overstated, with many 20th-century writers repeating Sir [[Charles Oman]]'s idea<ref>Charles Oman, ''Art of War in the Middle Ages'', Cornell University Press, 1960, {{ISBN|0-8014-9062-6}}</ref> that the battle represented a turning point in military history, with heavy cavalry triumphing over Roman infantry and ushering in the age of the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[knight]]. This idea was overturned by T. S. Burns in 1973.<ref>T. S. Burns, \u2018The Battle of Adrianople, a reconsideration\u2019, Historia, xxii (1973), pp. 336\u201345</ref> Burns shows that the Gothic army's cavalry arm was fairly small, that Valens would actually have had more cavalry and that while the role of Fritigern's cavalry was critical to his victory, the battle was a mainly infantry versus infantry affair. The Medieval knight was not to rise for several centuries after Adrianople. It is also often stated that the defeat at Adrianople led to changes in the composition of the late Roman Army and an increase in the use of cavalry. In fact, this process had been going on in the Roman Army long before 378, with cavalry increasing its role and status in the Army from at least the time of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253 to 260 CE).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n* [[Alessandro Barbero]] (2007).

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The title refers to the [[Pont Neuf]] bridge in [[Paris]]. The North American title of the film is '''''The Lovers on the Bridge''''',<ref>[http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/loversonthebridge.htm ''The Lovers on the Bridge''], DVDBeaver (illustrates the front covers of the North American Region 1 DVD and the British Region 2 DVD)</ref> and, in a mistranslation of the original title, the Australian title is '''''Lovers on the Ninth Bridge''''' (instead of \"Lovers on the New Bridge\").\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Pont Neuf Paris by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|left|The film is set on the Pont Neuf in Paris]]Set around the [[Pont Neuf]], Paris's oldest bridge, while it was closed for repairs, ''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'' depicts a love story between two young [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] Alex ([[Denis Lavant]]) and Mich\u00e8le ([[Juliette Binoche]]). Alex is a street performer addicted to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[sedative]]s and Mich\u00e8le a painter driven to a life on the streets because of a failed [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] and a disease which is slowly destroying her sight. The film portrays their harsh existence living on the bridge with Hans ([[Klaus Michael Gr\u00fcber]]), an older vagrant. As her vision deteriorates Mich\u00e8le becomes increasingly dependent on Alex. When a possible treatment becomes available, Mich\u00e8le's family use street posters and radio appeals to trace her. Fearing that she will leave him if she receives the treatment, Alex tries to keep Mich\u00e8le from becoming aware of her family's attempts to find her. The streets, skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop for the story in a series of set-pieces set during the French Bicentennial celebrations in 1989.\n\n==Production==\nGuiton's documentary notes that from the outset Leos Carax wanted to make a simple film, originally talking about doing it with a small team, in black and white and via Super 8. His first movie ''[[Boy Meets Girl (1984 film)|Boy Meets Girl]]'' had been a small affair, whereas ''[[Mauvais Sang (film)|Mauvais Sang]]'' had been considerably larger and more costly, albeit more successful at the box office.\n\nFrom the start, basing a movie on a public bridge in the centre of Paris was complicated. The production team wanted to block off the bridge for 3 months. This was immediately deemed impractical, and the creation of a model was proposed and created by the set designer Michel Vandestein. Initially, the intention was to film the daylight scenes on the actual bridge, and the night time scenes on the simplified model. At this point, the budget of between 8 and 9 million francs had to be adjusted by 5 million. A search for locations across Europe ended up back in France \u2014 the town of [[Lansargues]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[H\u00e9rault]] in southern France. Construction began.\n\nAt this time, the mayor of Paris gave the authorization for filming in Paris on the Pont Neuf \u2014 between 28 July and 18 August. While tying his shoe on set, lead actor [[Denis Lavant]] injured the tendon in his thumb so badly that filming could not be completed in the given time. The insurers were called \u2014 Carax was pressured to recast the male lead. However the director insisted that he could not recast or change his approach to the film to allow for Lavant's injury. Immediately, the solution was clear \u2014 the Lansargues model was to be extended for daytime use. At this point only a few minutes of footage had been shot.\n\nThe producers secured a further 9 million to develop the set. This extra budget seemed too low given the extent of work required at the Lansargues site. It soon became obvious that more money would be required before shooting could resume. Without this funding the producers were obliged to accept an insurance payment that would settle outstanding debts but not allow any further work. Production was shut down. A frustrated cast and crew took time off to relax and it was not until the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]] that Dominique Vignier, together with the Swiss millionaire Francis von Buren, agreed to undertake the funding based on the few short rushes filmed a year before.\n\nIn the documentary Von Buren clearly states that he was deceived about the upcoming costs he would be forced to take on.

The title refers to the [[Pont Neuf]] bridge in [[Paris]]. The North American title of the film is '''''The Lovers on the Bridge''''',<ref>[http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/loversonthebridge.htm ''The Lovers on the Bridge''], DVDBeaver (illustrates the front covers of the North American Region 1 DVD and the British Region 2 DVD)</ref> and, in a mistranslation of the original title, the Australian title is '''''Lovers on the Ninth Bridge''''' (instead of \"Lovers on the New Bridge\").\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Pont Neuf Paris by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|left|The film is set on the Pont Neuf in Paris]]Set around the [[Pont Neuf]], Paris's oldest bridge, while it was closed for repairs, ''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'' depicts a love story between two young [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] Alex ([[Denis Lavant]]) and Mich\u00e8le ([[Juliette Binoche]]). Alex is a street performer addicted to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[sedative]]s and Mich\u00e8le a painter driven to a life on the streets because of a failed [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] and a disease which is slowly destroying her sight. The film portrays their harsh existence living on the bridge with Hans ([[Klaus Michael Gr\u00fcber]]), an older vagrant. As her vision deteriorates Mich\u00e8le becomes increasingly dependent on Alex. When a possible treatment becomes available, Mich\u00e8le's family use street posters and radio appeals to trace her. Fearing that she will leave him if she receives the treatment, Alex tries to keep Mich\u00e8le from becoming aware of her family's attempts to find her. The streets, skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop for the story in a series of set-pieces set during the [[French Bicentennial]] celebrations in 1989.\n\n==Production==\nGuiton's documentary notes that from the outset Leos Carax wanted to make a simple film, originally talking about doing it with a small team, in black and white and via Super 8. His first movie ''[[Boy Meets Girl (1984 film)|Boy Meets Girl]]'' had been a small affair, whereas ''[[Mauvais Sang (film)|Mauvais Sang]]'' had been considerably larger and more costly, albeit more successful at the box office.\n\nFrom the start, basing a movie on a public bridge in the centre of Paris was complicated. The production team wanted to block off the bridge for 3 months. This was immediately deemed impractical, and the creation of a model was proposed and created by the set designer [[Michel Vandestein]]. Initially the intention was to film the daylight scenes on the actual bridge, and the night time scenes on the simplified model. At this point the budget of between 8 and 9 million francs had to be adjusted by 5 million. A search for locations across Europe ended up back in France \u2014 the town of [[Lansargues]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[H\u00e9rault]] in southern France. Construction began.\n\nAt this time the mayor of Paris gave the authorisation for filming in Paris on the Pont Neuf \u2014 between 28 July and 18 August. While tying his shoe on set, lead actor [[Denis Lavant]] injured the tendon in his thumb so badly that filming could not be completed in the given time. The insurers were called \u2014 Carax was pressured to recast the male lead. However the director insisted that he could not recast or change his approach to the film to allow for Lavant's injury. Immediately the solution was clear \u2014 the Lansargues model was to be extended for daytime use. At this point only a few minutes of footage had been shot.\n\nThe producers secured a further 9 million to develop the set. This extra budget seemed too low given the extent of work required at the Lansargues site. It soon became obvious that more money would be required before shooting could resume. Without this funding the producers were obliged to accept an insurance payment that would settle outstanding debts but not allow any further work. Production was shut down. A frustrated cast and crew took time off to relax and it was not until the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]] that Dominique Vignier, together with the Swiss millionaire Francis von Buren, agreed to undertake the funding based on the few short rushes filmed a year before.\n\nIn the documentary Von Buren clearly states that he was deceived about the upcoming costs he would be forced to take on. The number of 30 million francs, given for the total cost of construction and to finish the film, was not nearly enough; the final number from this stage would be closer to 70 million francs. He withdrew his funding late in 1989 with an estimated loss of 10 million francs. Yet again, production stopped. From October 1989 to June 1990 the only person at the site in Lansargues was the guard \u2014 and a number of storms followed over that winter causing massive water damage to the uncompleted set.\n\n==Release==\nAt the Cannes festival in 1990 Christian Fechner allocated 70 million francs in order to finish the film.

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others. During these events, western Washington experienced up to {{convert|6|ft}} of snow, sub-zero (\u221218 \u00b0C) temperatures, three months with snow on the ground, and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=3681 |title=Snow and Other Weathers\u2014Seattle and King County |first=Paul |last=Dorpat |date=January 31, 2002 |publisher=HistoryLink.org |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308023623/http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=3681 |archive-date=March 8, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Seattle's lowest officially recorded temperature is {{convert|0|F}} set on January 31, 1950, but low-altitude areas approximately three hours away from Seattle have recorded lows as cold as {{convert|-48|F}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ggweather.com/climate/extremes_us.htm |title=United States Extreme Record Temperatures & Differences |year=2005 |publisher=Golden Gate Weather Services |accessdate=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001055459/http://ggweather.com/climate/extremes_us.htm |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Southern Oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season. During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Ni\u00f1a phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the [[University of Washington]] published ''The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy'', a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |title=Climate Change\u2014Economic Impacts |publisher=Ecy.wa.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040420/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Rain shadow effects====\n\n{{main|Rain shadow}}\n\n[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season\u2014{{convert|1140|in|ft m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html | title = Mt.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with [[grassland]] and [[shrub-steppe]].\n\n====Temperatures====\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]]. The highest recorded temperature in the state was {{convert|118|F}} at [[Ice Harbor Dam]]. Both records were set east of the Cascades. Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long-lasting drizzles in the winter and warm, temperate summers. The Eastern region occasionally experiences extreme climate. Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon.

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]].

The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]].

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

Similarly, Washington voters approved a [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|2008 referendum]] on legalization of [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], and is currently one of only five states, along with [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Vermont]], as well as [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] to have legalized the practice.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Ni\u00f1a phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the [[University of Washington]] published ''The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy'', a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |title=Climate Change\u2014Economic Impacts |publisher=Ecy.wa.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040420/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Rain shadow effects====\n\n{{main|Rain shadow}}\n\n[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season\u2014{{convert|1140|in|ft m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html | title = Mt.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with [[grassland]] and [[shrub-steppe]].\n\n====Temperatures====\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]]. The highest recorded temperature in the state was {{convert|118|F}} at [[Ice Harbor Dam]]. Both records were set east of the Cascades. Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, and long-lasting drizzles in the winter, and warm, temperate summers. The Eastern region occasionally experiences extreme climate. Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon.

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's discriminatory settlement laws.<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]; [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[dieldrin]], and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

Washington has voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee in every election since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n\nDue to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide.

One consequence of this was that the north African tropical forest began to retreat, being replaced first by open [[grasslands]] and eventually by [[desert]] (the modern [[Sahara]]). As their environment changed from continuous forest to patches of forest separated by expanses of grassland, some primates adapted to a partly or fully ground-dwelling life. Here they were exposed to [[predator]]s, such as the [[big cats]], from whom they had previously been safe.\n\nThese environmental pressures caused selection to favor [[Savanna theory|bipedalism]]: walking on hind legs. This gave the Homininae's eyes greater elevation, the ability to see approaching danger further off, and a more efficient means of locomotion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=This is only one explanation}} It also freed the arms from the task of walking and made the hands available for tasks such as gathering food. At some point the bipedal [[primate]]s developed [[handedness]], giving them the ability to pick up sticks, [[bone]]s and stones and use them as [[weapon]]s, or as [[tool]]s for tasks such as killing smaller animals, cracking [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, or cutting up [[carrion|carcasses]]. In other words, these primates developed the use of primitive [[technology]]. Bipedal tool-using primates form the [[Hominina]] subtribe, of which the earliest species, such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'', date to about 7 to 5 million years ago.\n\nFrom about 5 million years ago, the hominin brain began to develop rapidly in both size and differentiation of function.\nThere has been a gradual increase in brain volume as humans progressed along the timeline of evolution (see [[Homininae]]), starting from about 600&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo habilis]]'' up to 1500&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. Thus, in general there's a correlation between brain volume and intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} However, modern ''Homo sapiens'' have a brain volume slightly smaller (1250&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>) than neanderthals, and the Flores hominids (''[[Homo floresiensis]]''), nicknamed hobbits, had a cranial capacity of about 380&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> (considered small for a chimpanzee) about a third of that of ''[[H. erectus]]''. It is proposed that they evolved from ''H. erectus'' as a case of insular dwarfism. With their three times smaller brain the Flores hominids apparently used fire and made tools as sophisticated as those of their ancestor ''H.erectus''. In this case, it seems that for intelligence, the structure of the brain is more important than its volume.\n\n===''Homo''===\n{{Further|Homo}}\nRoughly 2.4 million years ago ''[[Homo habilis]]'' had appeared in [[East Africa]]: the first known [[Homo|human]] species, and the first known to make [[stone tool]]s, yet the disputed findings of signs of tool use from even earlier ages and from the vicinity as multiple [[Australopithecus]] fossils may put this to question its \"greater intelligence when compared to earlier and more primitive [[Australopithecus]] genus\".\n\nThe use of tools conferred a crucial evolutionary advantage, and required a larger and more sophisticated brain to co-ordinate the fine hand movements required for this task.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Kwang Hyun|title=Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=5\u201322|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2016_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XXII_1_Ko.pdf}}</ref> Our knowledge of the complexity of behaviour of Homo habilis is not limited to stone culture, they also had habitual therapic use of [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTnWJGnBwgUC&lpg=PA247&ots=ho9C8czu3n&dq=toothpick%2Cmedicine%2Chomo&hl=fr&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q=toothpick,medicine,homo&f=false toothpicks].<ref>Puech P.-F., Puech S., Cianfarani F., Albertini H.

A larger brain requires a larger [[human skull|skull]], and thus requires the [[female]] to have a wider [[birth canal]] for the newborn's larger skull to pass through. But if the female's birth canal grew too wide, her [[pelvis]] would be so wide that she would lose the ability to run, which was a necessary skill 2 million years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe solution to this was to give birth at an early stage of fetal development, before the skull grew too large to pass through the birth canal. This adaptation enabled the human brain to continue to grow, but it imposed a new [[discipline]]. The need to care for helpless infants for long periods of time forced humans to become less mobile.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Human bands increasingly stayed in one place for long periods, so that females could care for infants, while males hunted food and fought with other bands that competed for food sources.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} As a result, humans became even more dependent on tool-making to compete with other animals and other humans, and relied less on body size and strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAbout 200,000 years ago [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] were colonized by [[Neanderthal|Neanderthal man]], [[Neanderthal extinction|extinct]] by 39,000 years ago following the appearance of modern humans in the region from 40,000\u201345,000 years ago.\n\n===''Homo sapiens''===\n\n[[File:Lion man photo.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Lion-man|The Lion-man]]\", found in the [[Hohlenstein-Stadel| Hohlenstein-Stadel cave]] of Germany's [[Swabian Alb]] and dated to 40,000 years ago, is associated with the [[Aurignacian culture]] and is the oldest known [[anthropomorphic]] animal figurine in the world.]]\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:450 height:125\nPlotArea = left:40 right:25 bottom:20 top:5\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\n id:green value:rgb(0.996,0.945,0.878)\n id:nil value:gray(0.9)\n id:era value:rgb(0.996,0.941,0.8)\n id:age value:rgb(0.996,0.937,0.756)\n id:period1 value:rgb(0.996,0.945,0.839)\n id:period3 value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n\nPeriod   = from:-2000000 till:2013\nTimeAxis  = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:250000 start:-2000000\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:20000 start:-2000000\n\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:5 shift:(0,-5)\n\n bar:&nbsp; from:-2000000 till:end width:35 color:period3\n\n bar:&nbsp; from:-2000000 till:end width:15 color:white\n\n bar:&nbsp; at:-2000000 color:period3 shift:(-20,7) text:[[Homo|Genus]]~[[Homo]]\n\n bar:&nbsp; color:period3\n from:-200000 till:-1800000\n at:-1800000 shift:(0,8) text:[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]\n at:-1800000 text:[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]\n at:-1800000 shift:(0,-24) text:[[Homo georgicus|H. georgicus]]\n\n bar:&nbsp; color:period3\n from:-1400000 till:end \n at:-1400000 shift:(0,-16) text:[[Homo habilis|H. habilis]]\n\n bar:&nbsp; color:period3\n from:2013 till:-200000 \n at:-200000 text:[[Homo sapiens|H. sapiens]]\n\n bar:&nbsp; color:period3\n from:-1200000 shift:(0,4) till:-800000 text:[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]\n\n bar:&#160; color:period3\n from:-29000 till:-230000\n at:-230000 shift:(0,-10) text:[[Homo neanderthalensis|H. neanderthalensis]]\n \n bar:&#160; color:period3 \n from:-230000 till:-600000\n at:-600000 shift:(0,5) width:5 text:[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]\n\n bar:Events color:nil mark:(line,black)\n at:-77000 shift:(0,5) text:[[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba]]\n at:-640000 shift:(0,5) text:[[Yellowstone Caldera|3rd Y.

It is unclear to what extent these early modern humans had developed [[origin of language|language]], [[origin of music|music]], [[evolutionary origin of religions|religion]], etc. They spread throughout [[Africa]] over the following approximately 50,000 years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAccording to proponents of the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], the climate in non-tropical regions of the earth experienced a sudden freezing about 70,000 years ago, because of a huge explosion of the Toba volcano that filled the atmosphere with volcanic ash for several years. This reduced the human population to less than 10,000 breeding pairs in equatorial Africa, from which all modern humans are descended. Being unprepared for the sudden change in climate, the survivors were those intelligent enough to invent new tools and ways of keeping warm and finding new sources of food (for example, adapting to ocean fishing based on prior fishing skills used in lakes and streams that became frozen).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAround 80,000\u2013100,000 years ago, three main lines of ''Homo sapiens'' diverged, bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] (mtDNA) / [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] (Y-DNA) colonizing [[Southern Africa]] (the ancestors of the [[Khoisan]]/[[Capoid]] peoples), bearers of haplogroup [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] (mtDNA) / [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B]] (Y-DNA) settling [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] (the ancestors of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] speaking peoples), while the bearers of haplogroup [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] remained in East Africa.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe \"Great Leap Forward\" leading to full [[behavioral modernity]] sets in only after this separation. Rapidly increasing sophistication in tool-making and behaviour is apparent from about 80,000 years ago, and the [[recent African origin|migration out of Africa]] follows towards the very end of the [[Middle Paleolithic]], some 60,000 years ago. Fully modern behaviour, including [[figurative art]], [[music]], self-ornamentation, [[trade]], [[burial rite]]s etc. is evident by 30,000 years ago. The oldest unequivocal examples of [[prehistoric art]] date to this period, the [[Aurignacian]] and the [[Gravettian]] periods of [[prehistoric Europe]], such as the [[Venus figurines]] and [[cave painting]] ([[Chauvet Cave]]) and the earliest [[prehistoric music|musical instruments]] (the bone pipe of [[Geissenkl\u00f6sterle]], [[Germany]], dated to about 36,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/lithoacoustics/BAR2002/BARpreprint.pdf |author=Cross, I., Zubrow, E. and Cowan, F. |year=2002 |chapter=Musical behaviours and the archaeological record: a preliminary study |editor=J.

It is crucial to keep in mind that evolution operates within a limited framework at a given point in time. In other words, the adaptations that a species can develop are not infinite and are defined by what has already taken place in the evolutionary timeline of a species. Given the immense anatomical and structural complexity of the brain, its evolution (and the congruent evolution of human intelligence), can only be reorganized in a finite number of ways. The majority of said changes occur either in terms of size or in terms of developmental timeframes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Iriki A, Sakura O | title = The neuroscience of primate intellectual evolution: natural selection and passive and intentional niche construction | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Scholars suggest that this could have, in part, been caused by convergent evolution. One common characteristic that is present in species of \"high degree intelligence\" (i.e. dolphins, great apes, and humans - ''Homo sapiens'') is a brain of enlarged size. Along with this, there is a more developed neocortex, a folding of the cerebral cortex, and [[Spindle neuron|von Economo neurons]]. Said neurons are linked to social intelligence and the ability to gauge what another is thinking or feeling and, interestingly, are also present in bottlenose dolphins.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Bearzi M, Stanford CB |date=2007|title=Dolphins and African apes: comparisons of sympatric socio-ecology |journal=Contributions to Zoology|volume=76|issue=4|pages=235\u2013254|doi=10.1163/18759866-07604003 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt5gv9w4jw/qt5gv9w4jw.pdf?t=krnonn}}</ref> The [[cerebral cortex]] is divided into four lobes (frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal) each with specific functions.

The cerebral cortex, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, are populated with neural circuits dedicated to language. There are two main areas of the brain commonly associated with language, namely: [[Wernicke's area]] and [[Broca's area]]. The former is responsible for the understanding of speech and the latter for the production of speech. Homologous regions have been found in other species (i.e. Area 44 and 45 have been studied in chimpanzees) but they are not as strongly related to or involved in linguistic activities as in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schenker NM, Hopkins WD, Spocter MA, Garrison AR, Stimpson CD, Erwin JM, Hof PR, Sherwood CC | title = Broca's area homologue in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): probabilistic mapping, asymmetry, and comparison to humans | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 730\u201342 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19620620 | pmc = 2820707 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhp138 }}</ref>\n\nA big portion of the scholarly literature focus on the evolution, and subsequent influence, of culture.

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the success of groups is dependent on their size at foundation, with groupings of around 150 being particularly successful, potentially reflecting the fact that communities of this size strike a balance between the minimum size of effective functionality and the maximum size for creating a sense of commitment to the community.<ref>{{cite journal|title = The Social Brain: Psychological Underpinnings and Implications for the Structure of Organizations|last = Dunbar|first = R.I.M.|date = 2014|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume = 23|issue = 2|pages = 109\u2013114|doi = 10.1177/0963721413517118}}</ref> According to the social brain hypothesis, when hominids started living in large groups, selection favored greater intelligence.

According to this strand of thought what led to the evolution of advanced intelligence in Homo sapiens was a drastic reduction of the aggressive drive. This change separated us from other species of monkeys and primates, where this aggressivity is still in plain sight, and eventually lead to the development of quintessential human traits such as empathy, social cognition and culture.<ref name=\"Eccles, John C. 1989\">Eccles, John C.

Social Exchange is a vital adaptation that evolved in social species and has become exceptionally specialized in humans. This adaption will develop by natural selection when two parties can make themselves better off than they were before by exchanging things one party values less for things the other party values for more. However, selection will only pressure social exchange when both parties are receiving mutual benefits from their relative situation; if one party cheats the other by receiving a benefit while the other is harmed, then selection will stop. Consequently, the existence of cheaters\u2014those who fail to deliver fair benefits\u2014threatens the evolution of exchange. Using evolutionary game theory, it has been shown that adaptations for social exchange can be favored and stably maintained by natural selection, but only if they include design features that enable them to detect cheaters, and cause them to channel future exchanges to reciprocators and away from cheaters. Thus, humans use social contracts to lay the benefits and losses each party will be receiving (if you accept benefit B from me, then you must satisfy my requirement R). Humans have evolved an advanced cheater detection system, equipped with proprietary problem-solving strategies that evolved to match the recurrent features of their corresponding problem domains. Not only do humans need to determine that the contract was violated, but also if the violation was intentionally done. Therefore, systems are specialized to detect contract violations that imply intentional cheating.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosmides L, Barrett HC, Tooby J | title = Colloquium paper: adaptive specializations, social exchange, and the evolution of human intelligence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 Suppl 2 | pages = 9007\u201314 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20445099 | pmc = 3024027 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914623107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9007C }}</ref>\n\nOne problem with the hypothesis that specific punishment for intentional deception could coevolve with intelligence is the fact that selective punishment of individuals with certain characteristics selects against the characteristics in question. For example, if only individuals capable of remembering what they had agreed to were punished for breaking agreements, evolution would have selected against the ability to remember what one had agreed to.<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future 1886</ref><ref>Allen, Elizabeth, et al.

Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection</ref> Though this becomes a superficial argument after considering the balancing positive selection for the ability to successfully 'make ones case'. Intelligence predicts the number of arguments one can make when taking either side of a debate. Humans who could get away with behaviours that exploited within and without-group cooperation, getting more while giving less, would overcome this.\n\n===Sexual selection===\n{{See also|Sexual selection in humans}}\nThis model, which invokes [[sexual selection]], is proposed by [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] who argues that human intelligence is unnecessarily sophisticated for the needs of [[hunter-gatherers]] to survive. He argues that the manifestations of intelligence such as language, music and art did not evolve because of their utilitarian value to the survival of ancient hominids. Rather, intelligence may have been a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] indicator. Hominids would have been [[mate choice|chosen]] for greater intelligence as an indicator of healthy genes and a [[Fisherian runaway]] [[positive feedback]] loop of sexual selection would have led to the evolution of human intelligence in a relatively short period.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|title-link=The Mating Mind|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nIn many species, only males have impressive [[secondary sexual characteristics]] such as ornaments and show-off behavior, but sexual selection is also thought to be able to act on females as well in at least partially [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous species]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Jones, Ian L. |author2=Hunter, Fiona M. |title=Mutual sexual selection in a monogamous seabird|journal=Nature |volume=362|pages=238\u2013239 |year=1993| doi=10.1038/362238a0|issue=6417|bibcode=1993Natur.362..238J}}</ref> With complete monogamy, there is [[assortative mating]] for sexually selected traits. This means that less attractive individuals will find other less attractive individuals to mate with. If attractive traits are good fitness indicators, this means that sexual selection increases the [[genetic load]] of the offspring of unattractive individuals. Without sexual selection, an unattractive individual might find a superior mate with few deleterious mutations, and have healthy children that are likely to survive. With sexual selection, an unattractive individual is more likely to have access only to an inferior mate who is likely to pass on many deleterious mutations to their joint offspring, who are then less likely to survive.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nSexual selection is often thought to be a likely explanation for other female-specific human traits, for example breasts and buttocks far larger in proportion to total body size than those found in related species of ape.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> It is often assumed that if breasts and buttocks of such large size were necessary for functions such as suckling infants, they would be found in other species.

Page 51.]</ref> are found [[sexually attractive]] by many men is in agreement with sexual selection acting on human females secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nSexual selection for intelligence and judging ability can act on indicators of success, such as highly visible displays of wealth. Growing human brains require more nutrition than brains of related species of ape. It is possible that for females to successfully judge male intelligence, they must be intelligent themselves. This could explain why despite the absence of clear differences in intelligence between males and females on average, there are clear differences between male and female propensities to display their intelligence in ostentatious forms.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nThis absence of difference is now known to exist at the middle of distributions. Average intelligence doesn't differ much between genders, but because female selection is restricted more towards males at the top end of male-male hierarchies or those increasingly above average in physical attractiveness, male trait distributions often have longer tails; that is to say the lowest and highest intelligences (and many more traits) in male populations extend further out into the lowest and highest values of the distribution than for female traits. This is because it paid to be a highly variable male, as average males would have consistently low opportunity, but variable males had a chance of falling on the preferred side of the trait distribution.\n\n====Critique====\nThe sexual selection by the disability principle/fitness display model of the evolution of human intelligence is criticized by certain researchers for issues of timing of the costs relative to reproductive age. While sexually selected ornaments such as peacock feathers and moose antlers develop either during or after puberty, timing their costs to a sexually mature age, human brains expend large amounts of nutrients building [[myelin]] and other brain mechanisms for efficient communication between the neurons early in life. These costs early in life build facilitators that reduce the cost of neuron firing later in life, and as a result the peaks of the brain's costs and the peak of the brain's performance are timed on opposite sides of puberty with the costs peaking at a sexually immature age while performance peaks at a sexually mature age. Critical researchers argue the above shows that the cost of intelligence is a signal which reduces the chance of surviving to reproductive age, and does not signal fitness of sexually mature individuals. Since the disability principle is about selection from disabilities in sexually immature individuals, which increases the offspring's chance of survival to reproductive age, disabilities would be selected against and not for by the above mechanism. These critics argue that human intelligence evolved by natural selection citing that unlike sexual selection, natural selection have produced many traits that cost the most nutrients before puberty including immune systems and accumulation and modification for increased toxicity of poisons in the body as a protective measure against predators.<ref>The Evolution of Intelligence; Robert J.

People infected with parasites may have brain damage and obvious maladaptive behavior in addition to visible signs of disease. Smarter people can more skillfully learn to distinguish safe non-polluted water and food from unsafe kinds and learn to distinguish mosquito infested areas from safe areas. Smarter people can more skillfully find and develop safe food sources and living environments. Given this situation, preference for smarter child-bearing/rearing partners increases the chance that their descendants will inherit the best resistance [[allele]]s, not only for [[immune system]] resistance to disease, but also smarter brains for learning skills in avoiding disease and selecting nutritious food. When people search for mates based on their success, wealth, reputation, disease-free body appearance, or psychological traits such as benevolence or confidence; the effect is to select for superior intelligence that results in superior disease resistance.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Ecological dominance-social competition model===\n\nA predominant model describing the evolution of human intelligence is ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC),<ref name=flinn>{{cite journal| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf| title=Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence| journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|author=Flinn, M.

According to the model, human intelligence was able to evolve to significant levels because of the combination of increasing domination over [[habitat]] and increasing importance of social interactions. As a result, the primary selective pressure for increasing human intelligence shifted from learning to master the [[nature|natural world]] to competition for dominance among members or groups of its own species.\n\nAs advancement, survival and reproduction within an increasing complex social structure favored ever more advanced social skills, [[communication]] of concepts through increasingly complex language patterns ensued. Since competition had shifted bit by bit from controlling \"nature\" to influencing other humans, it became of relevance to outmaneuver other members of the group seeking [[leadership]] or [[acceptance]], by means of more advanced social skills. A more social and communicative person would be more easily selected.\n\n===Intelligence dependent on brain size===\n\nHuman intelligence is developed to an extreme level that is not necessarily adaptive in an evolutionary sense. Firstly, larger-headed babies are more difficult to give [[birth]] to and large brains are costly in terms of [[nutrient]] and [[oxygen]] requirements.<ref name=\"isler\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Isler K, van Schaik CP | title = Metabolic costs of brain size evolution | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 557\u201360 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17148287 | pmc = 1834002 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0538 }}</ref> Thus the direct adaptive benefit of human intelligence is questionable at least in modern societies, while it is difficult to study in prehistoric societies. Since 2005, scientists have been evaluating genomic data on gene variants thought to influence head size, and have found no evidence that those genes are under strong selective pressure in current human populations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ossorio |first=Pilar N. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture |editor1-last=Krimsky |editor1-first=Sheldon |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Kathleen |chapter=Chapter 9: Myth and Mystification: The Science of Race and IQ |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVg4AAAAQBAJ |access-date=31 August 2013 |date=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-52769-9 |lay-url=http://www.cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15696-7/ |laydate=31 August 2013 |page=189 |quote=Since 2005, other researchers have evaluated the same data on MCHPI and ASPM, plus some additional data, and concluded that there is no evidence that these genes have been under natural selection in modern humans. These reanalyses undercut the idea that the particular variants found at high frequency among people of European descent somehow made Europeans better adapted for modern civilization. Additional studies have discovered that the MCHPI and ASPM variants reported in the 2005 papers do not correlate with larger (or smaller) than average head size. The genes were originally described as having to do with head size because some variants of these genes can cause microcephaly (extremely small heads that lack major portions of the brain). However, those microcephaly-causing variants were not included in the studies published in 2005. Finally, several research groups have tried and failed to show any correlation between the variants described in the 2005 papers and IQ reading abilities, or verbal abilities.

The group benefits of intelligence (including language, the ability to communicate between individuals, the ability to teach others, and other cooperative aspects) have apparent utility in increasing the survival potential of a group.\n\nIn addition, the theory of group selection is inherently tied to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Specifically, that \"group-related adaptations must be attributed to the natural selection of alternative groups of individuals and that the natural selection of alternative alleles within populations will be opposed to this development\".<ref>Williams, George C and Dawkins, R. \"Group Selection.\" ''Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton; Oxford, 2019, pp. 92\u2013124.</ref>\n\nBetween-group selection can be used to explain the changes and adaptations that arise within a group of individuals. Group-related adaptations and changes are a byproduct of between-group selection as traits or characteristics that prove to be advantageous in relation to another group will become increasingly popular and disseminated within a group. In the end, increasing its overall chance of surviving a competing group.\n\nHowever, this explanation cannot be applied to humans (and other species, predominantly other mammals) that live in stable, established social groupings. This is because of the social intelligence that functioning within these groups requires from the individual. Humans, while they are not the only ones, possess the cognitive and mental capacity to form systems of personal relationships and ties that extend well beyond those of the nucleus of family. The continuous process of creating, interacting, and adjusting to other individuals is a key component of many species' ecology.\n\nThese concepts can be tied to the social brain hypothesis, mentioned above. This hypothesis posits that human cognitive complexity arose as a result of the higher level of social complexity required from living in enlarged groups. These bigger groups entail a greater amount of social relations and interactions thus leading to an expanded quantity of intelligence in humans.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, this hypothesis has been under academic scrutiny in recent years and has been largely disproven. In fact, the size of a species' brain can be much better predicted by diet instead of measures of sociality as noted by the study conducted by DeCasien et al. They found that ecological factors (such as: folivory/frugivory, environment) explain a primate brain size much better than social factors (such as: group size, mating system).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nutritional status===\n\nDiets deficient in [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[protein]], [[iodine]], [[B vitamins]], [[omega 3 fatty acids]], [[magnesium]] and other nutrients can result in lower intelligence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20041021205759data_trunc_sys.shtml |title= Poor Nutrition Leads to Low IQ| last = Melville | first = Kate | name-list-format = vanc |date= 22 November 2004|work= scienceagogo.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Increase Intelligence| last = Hoffer | first = Abram | name-list-format = vanc |journal= Nutrition Health Review|volume=52| year=1989}}</ref> either in the mother during pregnancy or in the child during development.

Previc emphasizes the contribution of nutritional factors, especially meat and shellfish consumption, to elevations of [[dopaminergic]] activity in the brain, which may have been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence since [[dopamine]] is crucial to working memory, cognitive shifting, abstract, distant concepts, and other hallmarks of advanced intelligence.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Previc FH | date = 2009 | title = The dopaminergic mind in human evolution and history | location = Cambridge, England | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-51699-0 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Behavioral modernity]]\n* [[Brain size]]\n* [[Encephalization quotient]]\n* [[Fisherian runaway]]\n* [[Human evolution]]\n* {{annotated link|Noogenesis}} \n* [[Primate cognition]]\n* [[Race and intelligence]]<!-- just to throw the cat among the pigeons -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Byrne | first = Richard W | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1995 | title = The Thinking Ape: Evolutionary origins of intelligence | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | isbn = 978-0-19-852188-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/thinkingapeevolu0000byrn }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Greenspan | first1 = Stanley I. | last2 = Shanker | first2 = Stuart | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2004 | title = The First Idea: How symbols, language, and intelligence evolved from our early primate ancestors to modern humans | publisher = Da Capo Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-7382-0680-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/firstideahowsymb00gree }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Skoyles J, Sagan D | author-link1 = John Skoyles (scientist) | author-link2 = Dorion Sagan | date = 2002 | title = Up from Dragons: The evolution of human intelligence | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-137825-3 | title-link = Up from Dragons }}\n* {{cite book | last = Tobias | first = Phillip V. | year = 1971 | title = The Brain in Hominid Evolution | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-231-03518-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/braininhominidev00tob_f8p }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Roth G, Dicke U | title = Evolution of the brain and intelligence | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 250\u20137 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866152 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.03.005 }}\n* {{cite book| first1 = Alexander | last1 = Todorov| first2 = Susan | last2 = Fiske | first3 = Deborah A. | last3 = Prentice | name-list-format = vanc |title=Social Neuroscience: Toward Understanding the Underpinnings of the Social Mind |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgSDAAAQBAJ |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-531687-2 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Evolutionary psychology}}\n{{Human Evolution}}\n{{Human intelligence topics}}\n{{Evolution}}\n{{animal cognition}}\n\n[[Category:Human evolution]]\n[[Category:Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The development of intelligence in humans and association with evolution of the brain and the origin of language}}\nThe '''evolution of human intelligence''' is closely tied to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and to the [[origin of language]].

One consequence of this was that the north African tropical forest began to retreat, being replaced first by open [[grasslands]] and eventually by [[desert]] (the modern [[Sahara]]). As their environment changed from continuous forest to patches of forest separated by expanses of grassland, some primates adapted to a partly or fully ground-dwelling life. Here they were exposed to [[predator]]s, such as the [[big cats]], from whom they had previously been safe.\n\nThese environmental pressures caused selection to favor [[Savanna theory|bipedalism]]: walking on hind legs. This gave the Homininae's eyes greater elevation, the ability to see approaching danger further off, and a more efficient means of locomotion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=This is only one explanation}} It also freed the arms from the task of walking and made the hands available for tasks such as gathering food. At some point the bipedal [[primate]]s developed [[handedness]], giving them the ability to pick up sticks, [[bone]]s and stones and use them as [[weapon]]s, or as [[tool]]s for tasks such as killing smaller animals, cracking [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, or cutting up [[carrion|carcasses]]. In other words, these primates developed the use of primitive [[technology]]. Bipedal tool-using primates form the [[Hominina]] subtribe, of which the earliest species, such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'', date to about 7 to 5 million years ago.\n\nFrom about 5 million years ago, the hominin brain began to develop rapidly in both size and differentiation of function.\nThere has been a gradual increase in brain volume as humans progressed along the timeline of evolution (see [[Homininae]]), starting from about 600&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo habilis]]'' up to 1500&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. Thus, in general there's a correlation between brain volume and intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} However, modern ''Homo sapiens'' have a brain volume slightly smaller (1250&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>) than neanderthals, and the Flores hominids (''[[Homo floresiensis]]''), nicknamed hobbits, had a cranial capacity of about 380&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> (considered small for a chimpanzee) about a third of that of ''[[H. erectus]]''. It is proposed that they evolved from ''H. erectus'' as a case of insular dwarfism. With their three times smaller brain the Flores hominids apparently used fire and made tools as sophisticated as those of their ancestor ''H.erectus''. In this case, it seems that for intelligence, the structure of the brain is more important than its volume.\n\n===''Homo''===\n{{Further|Homo}}\nRoughly 2.4 million years ago ''[[Homo habilis]]'' had appeared in [[East Africa]]: the first known [[Homo|human]] species, and the first known to make [[stone tool]]s, yet the disputed findings of signs of tool use from even earlier ages and from the vicinity as multiple [[Australopithecus]] fossils may put this to question its \"greater intelligence when compared to earlier and more primitive [[Australopithecus]] genus\".\n\nThe use of tools conferred a crucial evolutionary advantage, and required a larger and more sophisticated brain to co-ordinate the fine hand movements required for this task.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Kwang Hyun|title=Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=5\u201322|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2016_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XXII_1_Ko.pdf}}</ref> Our knowledge of the complexity of behaviour of Homo habilis is not limited to stone culture, they also had habitual therapic use of [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTnWJGnBwgUC&lpg=PA247&ots=ho9C8czu3n&dq=toothpick%2Cmedicine%2Chomo&hl=fr&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q=toothpick,medicine,homo&f=false toothpicks].<ref>Puech P.-F., Puech S., Cianfarani F., Albertini H.

This reduced the human population to less than 10,000 breeding pairs in equatorial Africa, from which all modern humans are descended. Being unprepared for the sudden change in climate, the survivors were those intelligent enough to invent new tools and ways of keeping warm and finding new sources of food (for example, adapting to ocean fishing based on prior fishing skills used in lakes and streams that became frozen).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAround 80,000\u2013100,000 years ago, three main lines of ''Homo sapiens'' diverged, bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] (mtDNA) / [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] (Y-DNA) colonizing [[Southern Africa]] (the ancestors of the [[Khoisan]]/[[Capoid]] peoples), bearers of haplogroup [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] (mtDNA) / [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B]] (Y-DNA) settling [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] (the ancestors of [[Niger\u2013Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] speaking peoples), while the bearers of haplogroup [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] remained in East Africa.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe \"Great Leap Forward\" leading to full [[behavioral modernity]] sets in only after this separation. Rapidly increasing sophistication in tool-making and behaviour is apparent from about 80,000 years ago, and the [[recent African origin|migration out of Africa]] follows towards the very end of the [[Middle Paleolithic]], some 60,000 years ago. Fully modern behaviour, including [[figurative art]], [[music]], self-ornamentation, [[trade]], [[burial rite]]s etc. is evident by 30,000 years ago. The oldest unequivocal examples of [[prehistoric art]] date to this period, the [[Aurignacian]] and the [[Gravettian]] periods of [[prehistoric Europe]], such as the [[Venus figurines]] and [[cave painting]] ([[Chauvet Cave]]) and the earliest [[prehistoric music|musical instruments]] (the bone pipe of [[Geissenkl\u00f6sterle]], [[Germany]], dated to about 36,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/lithoacoustics/BAR2002/BARpreprint.pdf |author=Cross, I., Zubrow, E. and Cowan, F. |year=2002 |chapter=Musical behaviours and the archaeological record: a preliminary study |editor=J.

It is crucial to keep in mind that evolution operates within a limited framework at a given point in time. In other words, the adaptations that a species can develop are not infinite and are defined by what has already taken place in the evolutionary timeline of a species. Given the immense anatomical and structural complexity of the brain, its evolution (and the congruent evolution of human intelligence), can only be reorganized in a finite number of ways. The majority of said changes occur either in terms of size or in terms of developmental timeframes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Iriki A, Sakura O | title = The neuroscience of primate intellectual evolution: natural selection and passive and intentional niche construction | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Scholars suggest that this could have, in part, been caused by convergent evolution. One common characteristic that is present in species of \"high degree intelligence\" (i.e. dolphins, great apes, and humans - ''Homo sapiens'') is a brain of enlarged size. Along with this, there is a more developed neocortex, a folding of the cerebral cortex, and [[Spindle neuron|von Economo neurons]]. Said neurons are linked to social intelligence and the ability to gauge what another is thinking or feeling and, interestingly, are also present in bottlenose dolphins.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Bearzi M, Stanford CB |date=2007|title=Dolphins and African apes: comparisons of sympatric socio-ecology |journal=Contributions to Zoology|volume=76|issue=4|pages=235\u2013254|doi=10.1163/18759866-07604003 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt5gv9w4jw/qt5gv9w4jw.pdf?t=krnonn}}</ref> The [[cerebral cortex]] is divided into four lobes (frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal) each with specific functions.

The cerebral cortex, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, are populated with neural circuits dedicated to language. There are two main areas of the brain commonly associated with language, namely: [[Wernicke's area]] and [[Broca's area]]. The former is responsible for the understanding of speech and the latter for the production of speech. Homologous regions have been found in other species (i.e. Area 44 and 45 have been studied in chimpanzees) but they are not as strongly related to or involved in linguistic activities as in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schenker NM, Hopkins WD, Spocter MA, Garrison AR, Stimpson CD, Erwin JM, Hof PR, Sherwood CC | title = Broca's area homologue in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): probabilistic mapping, asymmetry, and comparison to humans | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 730\u201342 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19620620 | pmc = 2820707 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhp138 }}</ref>\n\nA big portion of the scholarly literature focus on the evolution, and subsequent influence, of culture.

Selection for cooperation aided our ancestors in surviving harsh ecological conditions and did so by creating a specific type of intelligence. An intelligence that, today, is highly variant from individual to individual.\n\n==Models==\n\n===Social brain hypothesis===\nThe social brain hypothesis was proposed by British anthropologist [[Robin Dunbar]], who argues that human intelligence did not evolve primarily as a means to solve ecological problems, but rather as a means of surviving and reproducing in large and complex social groups.<ref name=\"The Social Brain Hypothesis\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D\u00e1vid-Barrett T, Dunbar RI | title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality | journal = Proceedings.

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the success of groups is dependent on their size at foundation, with groupings of around 150 being particularly successful, potentially reflecting the fact that communities of this size strike a balance between the minimum size of effective functionality and the maximum size for creating a sense of commitment to the community.<ref>{{cite journal|title = The Social Brain: Psychological Underpinnings and Implications for the Structure of Organizations|last = Dunbar|first = R.I.M.|date = 2014|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume = 23|issue = 2|pages = 109\u2013114|doi = 10.1177/0963721413517118}}</ref> According to the social brain hypothesis, when hominids started living in large groups, selection favored greater intelligence.

According to this strand of thought what led to the evolution of advanced intelligence in Homo sapiens was a drastic reduction of the aggressive drive. This change separated us from other species of monkeys and primates, where this aggressivity is still in plain sight, and eventually lead to the development of quintessential human traits such as empathy, social cognition and culture.<ref name=\"Eccles, John C. 1989\">Eccles, John C.

Social Exchange is a vital adaptation that evolved in social species and has become exceptionally specialized in humans. This adaption will develop by natural selection when two parties can make themselves better off than they were before by exchanging things one party values less for things the other party values for more. However, selection will only pressure social exchange when both parties are receiving mutual benefits from their relative situation; if one party cheats the other by receiving a benefit while the other is harmed, then selection will stop. Consequently, the existence of cheaters\u2014those who fail to deliver fair benefits\u2014threatens the evolution of exchange. Using evolutionary game theory, it has been shown that adaptations for social exchange can be favored and stably maintained by natural selection, but only if they include design features that enable them to detect cheaters, and cause them to channel future exchanges to reciprocators and away from cheaters. Thus, humans use social contracts to lay the benefits and losses each party will be receiving (if you accept benefit B from me, then you must satisfy my requirement R). Humans have evolved an advanced cheater detection system, equipped with proprietary problem-solving strategies that evolved to match the recurrent features of their corresponding problem domains. Not only do humans need to determine that the contract was violated, but also if the violation was intentionally done. Therefore, systems are specialized to detect contract violations that imply intentional cheating.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosmides L, Barrett HC, Tooby J | title = Colloquium paper: adaptive specializations, social exchange, and the evolution of human intelligence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 Suppl 2 | pages = 9007\u201314 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20445099 | pmc = 3024027 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914623107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9007C }}</ref>\n\nOne problem with the hypothesis that specific punishment for intentional deception could coevolve with intelligence is the fact that selective punishment of individuals with certain characteristics selects against the characteristics in question. For example, if only individuals capable of remembering what they had agreed to were punished for breaking agreements, evolution would have selected against the ability to remember what one had agreed to.<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future 1886</ref><ref>Allen, Elizabeth, et al.

Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection</ref> Though this becomes a superficial argument after considering the balancing positive selection for the ability to successfully 'make ones case'. Intelligence predicts the number of arguments one can make when taking either side of a debate. Humans who could get away with behaviours that exploited within and without-group cooperation, getting more while giving less, would overcome this.\n\n===Sexual selection===\n{{See also|Sexual selection in human evolution}}\nThis model, which invokes [[sexual selection]], is proposed by [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] who argues that human intelligence is unnecessarily sophisticated for the needs of [[hunter-gatherers]] to survive. He argues that the manifestations of intelligence such as language, music and art did not evolve because of their utilitarian value to the survival of ancient hominids. Rather, intelligence may have been a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] indicator. Hominids would have been [[mate choice|chosen]] for greater intelligence as an indicator of healthy genes and a [[Fisherian runaway]] [[positive feedback]] loop of sexual selection would have led to the evolution of human intelligence in a relatively short period.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|title-link=The Mating Mind|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nIn many species, only males have impressive [[secondary sexual characteristics]] such as ornaments and show-off behavior, but sexual selection is also thought to be able to act on females as well in at least partially [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous species]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Jones, Ian L. |author2=Hunter, Fiona M. |title=Mutual sexual selection in a monogamous seabird|journal=Nature |volume=362|pages=238\u2013239 |year=1993| doi=10.1038/362238a0|issue=6417|bibcode=1993Natur.362..238J}}</ref> With complete monogamy, there is [[assortative mating]] for sexually selected traits. This means that less attractive individuals will find other less attractive individuals to mate with. If attractive traits are good fitness indicators, this means that sexual selection increases the [[genetic load]] of the offspring of unattractive individuals. Without sexual selection, an unattractive individual might find a superior mate with few deleterious mutations, and have healthy children that are likely to survive. With sexual selection, an unattractive individual is more likely to have access only to an inferior mate who is likely to pass on many deleterious mutations to their joint offspring, who are then less likely to survive.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nSexual selection is often thought to be a likely explanation for other female-specific human traits, for example breasts and buttocks far larger in proportion to total body size than those found in related species of ape.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> It is often assumed that if breasts and buttocks of such large size were necessary for functions such as suckling infants, they would be found in other species. That human female breasts (typical mammalian breast tissue is small)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ngtMd5YoWi4C&lpg=PA51&ots=kVn4k4IHDa&dq=great%20ape%20breast%20tissue&pg=PA51#v=onepage&q=great%20ape%20breast%20tissue&f=false \"Heredity and Society\". Author Ian Porter. 1972. Page 51.]</ref> are found [[sexually attractive]] by many men is in agreement with sexual selection acting on human females secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nSexual selection for intelligence and judging ability can act on indicators of success, such as highly visible displays of wealth. Growing human brains require more nutrition than brains of related species of ape. It is possible that for females to successfully judge male intelligence, they must be intelligent themselves. This could explain why despite the absence of clear differences in intelligence between males and females on average, there are clear differences between male and female propensities to display their intelligence in ostentatious forms.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nThis absence of difference is now known to exist at the middle of distributions. Average intelligence doesn't differ much between genders, but because female selection is restricted more towards males at the top end of male-male hierarchies or those increasingly above average in physical attractiveness, male trait distributions often have longer tails; that is to say the lowest and highest intelligences (and many more traits) in male populations extend further out into the lowest and highest values of the distribution than for female traits. This is because it paid to be a highly variable male, as average males would have consistently low opportunity, but variable males had a chance of falling on the preferred side of the trait distribution.\n\n====Critique====\nThe sexual selection by the disability principle/fitness display model of the evolution of human intelligence is criticized by certain researchers for issues of timing of the costs relative to reproductive age. While sexually selected ornaments such as peacock feathers and moose antlers develop either during or after puberty, timing their costs to a sexually mature age, human brains expend large amounts of nutrients building [[myelin]] and other brain mechanisms for efficient communication between the neurons early in life. These costs early in life build facilitators that reduce the cost of neuron firing later in life, and as a result the peaks of the brain's costs and the peak of the brain's performance are timed on opposite sides of puberty with the costs peaking at a sexually immature age while performance peaks at a sexually mature age. Critical researchers argue the above shows that the cost of intelligence is a signal which reduces the chance of surviving to reproductive age, and does not signal fitness of sexually mature individuals. Since the disability principle is about selection from disabilities in sexually immature individuals, which increases the offspring's chance of survival to reproductive age, disabilities would be selected against and not for by the above mechanism. These critics argue that human intelligence evolved by natural selection citing that unlike sexual selection, natural selection have produced many traits that cost the most nutrients before puberty including immune systems and accumulation and modification for increased toxicity of poisons in the body as a protective measure against predators.<ref>The Evolution of Intelligence; Robert J.

People infected with parasites may have brain damage and obvious maladaptive behavior in addition to visible signs of disease. Smarter people can more skillfully learn to distinguish safe non-polluted water and food from unsafe kinds and learn to distinguish mosquito infested areas from safe areas. Smarter people can more skillfully find and develop safe food sources and living environments. Given this situation, preference for smarter child-bearing/rearing partners increases the chance that their descendants will inherit the best resistance [[allele]]s, not only for [[immune system]] resistance to disease, but also smarter brains for learning skills in avoiding disease and selecting nutritious food. When people search for mates based on their success, wealth, reputation, disease-free body appearance, or psychological traits such as benevolence or confidence; the effect is to select for superior intelligence that results in superior disease resistance.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Ecological dominance-social competition model===\n\nA predominant model describing the evolution of human intelligence is ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC),<ref name=flinn>{{cite journal| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf| title=Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence| journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|author=Flinn, M. V.|author2= Geary, D. C.|author3= Ward, C. V. |year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.08.005|volume=26|issue=1|pages=10\u201346}}</ref> explained by Mark V. Flinn, David C. Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]]. According to the model, human intelligence was able to evolve to significant levels because of the combination of increasing domination over [[habitat]] and increasing importance of social interactions. As a result, the primary selective pressure for increasing human intelligence shifted from learning to master the [[nature|natural world]] to competition for dominance among members or groups of its own species.\n\nAs advancement, survival and reproduction within an increasing complex social structure favored ever more advanced social skills, [[communication]] of concepts through increasingly complex language patterns ensued. Since competition had shifted bit by bit from controlling \"nature\" to influencing other humans, it became of relevance to outmaneuver other members of the group seeking [[leadership]] or [[acceptance]], by means of more advanced social skills. A more social and communicative person would be more easily selected.\n\n===Intelligence dependent on brain size===\n\nHuman intelligence is developed to an extreme level that is not necessarily adaptive in an evolutionary sense. Firstly, larger-headed babies are more difficult to give [[birth]] to and large brains are costly in terms of [[nutrient]] and [[oxygen]] requirements.<ref name=\"isler\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Isler K, van Schaik CP | title = Metabolic costs of brain size evolution | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 557\u201360 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17148287 | pmc = 1834002 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0538 }}</ref> Thus the direct adaptive benefit of human intelligence is questionable at least in modern societies, while it is difficult to study in prehistoric societies. Since 2005, scientists have been evaluating genomic data on gene variants thought to influence head size, and have found no evidence that those genes are under strong selective pressure in current human populations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ossorio |first=Pilar N. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture |editor1-last=Krimsky |editor1-first=Sheldon |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Kathleen |chapter=Chapter 9: Myth and Mystification: The Science of Race and IQ |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVg4AAAAQBAJ |access-date=31 August 2013 |date=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-52769-9 |lay-url=http://www.cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15696-7/ |laydate=31 August 2013 |page=189 |quote=Since 2005, other researchers have evaluated the same data on MCHPI and ASPM, plus some additional data, and concluded that there is no evidence that these genes have been under natural selection in modern humans. These reanalyses undercut the idea that the particular variants found at high frequency among people of European descent somehow made Europeans better adapted for modern civilization. Additional studies have discovered that the MCHPI and ASPM variants reported in the 2005 papers do not correlate with larger (or smaller) than average head size. The genes were originally described as having to do with head size because some variants of these genes can cause microcephaly (extremely small heads that lack major portions of the brain). However, those microcephaly-causing variants were not included in the studies published in 2005. Finally, several research groups have tried and failed to show any correlation between the variants described in the 2005 papers and IQ reading abilities, or verbal abilities.

The group benefits of intelligence (including language, the ability to communicate between individuals, the ability to teach others, and other cooperative aspects) have apparent utility in increasing the survival potential of a group.\n\nIn addition, the theory of group selection is inherently tied to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Specifically, that \"group-related adaptations must be attributed to the natural selection of alternative groups of individuals and that the natural selection of alternative alleles within populations will be opposed to this development\".<ref>Williams, George C and Dawkins, R. \"Group Selection.\" ''Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton; Oxford, 2019, pp. 92\u2013124.</ref>\n\nBetween-group selection can be used to explain the changes and adaptations that arise within a group of individuals. Group-related adaptations and changes are a byproduct of between-group selection as traits or characteristics that prove to be advantageous in relation to another group will become increasingly popular and disseminated within a group. In the end, increasing its overall chance of surviving a competing group.\n\nHowever, this explanation cannot be applied to humans (and other species, predominantly other mammals) that live in stable, established social groupings. This is because of the social intelligence that functioning within these groups requires from the individual. Humans, while they are not the only ones, possess the cognitive and mental capacity to form systems of personal relationships and ties that extend well beyond those of the nucleus of family. The continuous process of creating, interacting, and adjusting to other individuals is a key component of many species' ecology.\n\nThese concepts can be tied to the social brain hypothesis, mentioned above. This hypothesis posits that human cognitive complexity arose as a result of the higher level of social complexity required from living in enlarged groups. These bigger groups entail a greater amount of social relations and interactions thus leading to an expanded quantity of intelligence in humans.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, this hypothesis has been under academic scrutiny in recent years and has been largely disproven. In fact, the size of a species' brain can be much better predicted by diet instead of measures of sociality as noted by the study conducted by DeCasien et al. They found that ecological factors (such as: folivory/frugivory, environment) explain a primate brain size much better than social factors (such as: group size, mating system).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nutritional status===\n\nDiets deficient in [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[protein]], [[iodine]], [[B vitamins]], [[omega 3 fatty acids]], [[magnesium]] and other nutrients can result in lower intelligence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20041021205759data_trunc_sys.shtml |title= Poor Nutrition Leads to Low IQ| last = Melville | first = Kate | name-list-format = vanc |date= 22 November 2004|work= scienceagogo.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Increase Intelligence| last = Hoffer | first = Abram | name-list-format = vanc |journal= Nutrition Health Review|volume=52| year=1989}}</ref> either in the mother during pregnancy or in the child during development. While these inputs did not have an effect on the evolution of intelligence they do govern its expression. A higher intelligence could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, whereas a lower intelligence could imply a child, its mother, or both, come from a physical and social environment where nutritional levels are low. Previc emphasizes the contribution of nutritional factors, especially meat and shellfish consumption, to elevations of [[dopaminergic]] activity in the brain, which may have been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence since [[dopamine]] is crucial to working memory, cognitive shifting, abstract, distant concepts, and other hallmarks of advanced intelligence.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Previc FH | date = 2009 | title = The dopaminergic mind in human evolution and history | location = Cambridge, England | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-51699-0 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Behavioral modernity]]\n* [[Brain size]]\n* [[Encephalization quotient]]\n* [[Fisherian runaway]]\n* [[Human evolution]]\n* {{annotated link|Noogenesis}} \n* [[Primate cognition]]\n* [[Race and intelligence]]<!-- just to throw the cat among the pigeons -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Byrne | first = Richard W | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1995 | title = The Thinking Ape: Evolutionary origins of intelligence | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | isbn = 978-0-19-852188-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/thinkingapeevolu0000byrn }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Greenspan | first1 = Stanley I. | last2 = Shanker | first2 = Stuart | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2004 | title = The First Idea: How symbols, language, and intelligence evolved from our early primate ancestors to modern humans | publisher = Da Capo Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-7382-0680-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/firstideahowsymb00gree }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Skoyles J, Sagan D | author-link1 = John Skoyles (scientist) | author-link2 = Dorion Sagan | date = 2002 | title = Up from Dragons: The evolution of human intelligence | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-137825-3 | title-link = Up from Dragons }}\n* {{cite book | last = Tobias | first = Phillip V. | year = 1971 | title = The Brain in Hominid Evolution | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-231-03518-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/braininhominidev00tob_f8p }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Roth G, Dicke U | title = Evolution of the brain and intelligence | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 250\u20137 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866152 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.03.005 }}\n* {{cite book| first1 = Alexander | last1 = Todorov| first2 = Susan | last2 = Fiske | first3 = Deborah A. | last3 = Prentice | name-list-format = vanc |title=Social Neuroscience: Toward Understanding the Underpinnings of the Social Mind |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgSDAAAQBAJ |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-531687-2 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Evolutionary psychology}}\n{{Human Evolution}}\n{{Human intelligence topics}}\n{{Evolution}}\n{{animal cognition}}\n\n[[Category:Human evolution]]\n[[Category:Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines]]\n", "name_user": "CommonKnowledgeCreator", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSexual selection:Redirect link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence"}

The contemporaneous justification for the strikes was Iraq's failure to comply with [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions and its interference with [[United Nations Special Commission]] inspectors.\n\nThe operation was a major flare-up in the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]]. The stated goal of the [[cruise missile]] and bombing attacks was to strike military and security targets in Iraq that contributed to Iraq's ability to produce, store, maintain, and deliver [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The bombing campaign had been anticipated since February 1998 and incurred wide-ranging criticism and support, at home and abroad.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/shows/1998/2/16 Headlines of February 16, 1998] ''Democracy Now!''</ref> [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] initially announced they would deny the U.S. military the use of local bases for the purpose of air strikes against Iraq.<ref name=\"nulear_clinton\">[http://www.democracynow.org/shows/1998/2/17 The Possibility of \"Mini-Nukes\" On Iraq], ''Democracy Now!'', 17 February 1998</ref>\n\n==Background==\nU.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] had been working under a regional security framework of [[dual containment]], which involved punishing Saddam Hussein's regime with military force whenever Iraq challenged the United States or the international community.\n\nAlthough there was no [[Authorization for Use of Military Force (disambiguation)|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] as there was during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] or a [[Declaration of War|declaration of war]], as in [[World War II]], Clinton signed into law H.R. 4655, the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] on 31 October 1998.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998] The Library of Congress.</ref> The new act appropriated funds for Iraqi opposition groups in the hope of removing Saddam Hussein from power and replacing his regime with a democratic government. Despite the act's intention of support of opposition groups, Clinton justified his order for US action under the act.\n\nThe act also stated that:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize or otherwise speak to the use of United States Armed Forces (except as provided in section 4(a)(2)) in carrying out this Act.</blockquote>\n\nSection 4(a)(2) states:\n\n<blockquote>The President is authorized to direct the drawdown of defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, defense services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training for [Iraqi democratic opposition] organizations.</blockquote>\n\nJust prior to Desert Fox, the U.S. nearly led a bombing campaign against Saddam called [[Operation Desert Thunder]]. It was abandoned at the last minute when the Iraqi leader allowed the UN to continue weapons inspections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_thunder.htm|title=Operation Desert Thunder / Desert Viper|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==\"Degrading,\" not eliminating==\n[[File:B-1B prepares for Operation Desert Fox.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A [[B-1B]] is loaded with bombs at [[Ellsworth AFB]] on 17 December 1998.]]\nClinton administration officials said the aim of the mission was to \"degrade\" Iraq's ability to manufacture and use weapons of mass destruction, not to eliminate it.  Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked about the distinction while the operation was going on:<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec98/albright_12-17.html Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)] NewsHour Online Web site (for the ''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' television program on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Web page containing transcript of television interview and titled \"Secretary Albright: 17 December 1998, accessed 25 September 2006</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I don't think we're pretending that we can get everything, so this is \u2013 I think \u2013 we are being very honest about what our ability is.

I think the president explained very clearly to the American people that this is the threat of the 21st century. [\u2026] [W]hat it means is that we know we can't get everything, but degrading is the right word.</blockquote>\n\nThe main targets of the bombing included weapons research and development installations, air defense systems, weapon and supply depots, and the barracks and command headquarters of Saddam's elite [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]]. Also, one of Saddam's lavish presidential palaces came under attack. Iraqi air defense batteries, unable to target the American and British jets, began to blanket the sky with near random bursts of flak fire. The air strikes continued unabated however, and [[cruise missile]] barrages launched by naval vessels added to the bombs dropped by the planes. By the fourth night, most of the specified targets had been damaged or destroyed, the operation was deemed a success and the air strikes ended.\n\n==Military operations==  \n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 981217-N-3962F-002.jpg|thumb|Two [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18C Hornet]] pilots onboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} discussing the results of an air strike conducted on 17 December]]\n{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}\nU.S. Navy aircraft from [[Carrier Air Wing Three]] (CVW 3), flying from {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and Patrol Squadron Four (PATRON FOUR), flew combat missions from the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of ODF.

The U.S. Air Force sent several sorties of F-16s from the [[34th Fighter Squadron]], and [[522nd Fighter Squadron]] into Iraq to fly night missions in support of Operation Desert Fox; they were based at [[Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base]], Kuwait.\n\nOn the second night of Operation Desert Fox, aircrews flying 12 [[B-52]]s took off from the island of [[Diego Garcia]] in the Indian Ocean and launched 74 conventional air-launched cruise missiles (CALCMs).  The missiles found their mark striking multiple Iraqi targets including six of President Saddam Hussein's palaces, several Republican Guard barracks, and the Ministries of Defense and Military Industry.  The following evening, two more B-52 crews launched 16 more CALCMs. Over a two-night period aircrews from the 2nd and 5th Bomb Wings launched a total of 90 CALCMs. The B-1 bomber made its combat debut by striking at Republican Guard targets. Also on 17 Dec, USAF aircraft based in Kuwait participated,  as did British [[Royal Air Force]] Tornado aircraft. The British contribution totaled 15 percent of the sorties flown in Desert Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18632 |title=Factsheets : Operation Desert Fox |publisher=Afhso.af.mil |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 19 December, U.S. and British aircraft had struck 97 targets, and Secretary of Defense William Cohen claimed the operation was a success. Supported by Secretary Cohen, as well as United States Central Command commander General Anthony C. Zinni and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Henry H. Shelton, President Bill Clinton declared \"victory\" in Operation Desert Fox. In total, the 70-hour campaign saw U.S. forces strike 85 percent of their targets, 75 percent of which were considered \"highly effective\" strikes. More than 600 sorties were flown by more than 300 combat and support aircraft, and 600 air dropped munitions were employed, including 90 air-launched cruise missiles and 325 Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAM). Operation Desert Fox inflicted serious damage to Iraq's missile development program, although its effects on any WMD program were not clear. Nevertheless, Operation Desert Fox was the largest strike against Iraq since the early 1990s Persian Gulf War, until the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n97 sites were targeted in the operation with 415 cruise missiles and 600 bombs, including 11 weapons production or storage facilities, 18 security facilities for weapons, 9 military installations, 20 government CCC facilities, 32 surface-to-air missile batteries, 6 airfields, and 1 oil refinery. According to U.S. Defense Department assessments on 20 December 10 of these targets were destroyed, 18 severely damaged, 18 moderately damaged, 18 lightly damaged, and 23 not yet assessed. According to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, the allied action killed (62) or wounded (180) some 242 Iraqi military personnel. American General Harry Shelton told the U.S. Senate on 5 January 1999, however, that the strikes killed or wounded an estimated 1,400 members of Iraq's Republican Guard.<ref>Carrington, Anca. \"Iraq: Issues, Historical Background, Bibliography.\" p. 16.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nIn reaction to the attack, three of five permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]] (Russia, France, and the People's Republic of China) called for lifting of the eight-year oil embargo on Iraq, recasting or disbanding [[United Nations Special Commission|UNSCOM]], and firing its chairman, Australian [[diplomat]] [[Richard Butler (diplomat)|Richard Butler]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Accusations of U.S. interference in the U.N. inspection process===\nIraq stopped cooperating with the U.N. special commission in the first month of 1998, but diplomacy by [[Kofi Annan]] brought fresh agreement and new modalities for the inspection of sensitive sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/23/iraq.deal.update.4am/index.html Annan, Iraq sign weapons-inspection deal] [[CNN]], 23 February 1998</ref> Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] had earlier accused UNSCOM officials of acting as spies for the United States,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/crisis_in_the_gulf/latest_news/250188.stm Iraq applauds spy claims] [[BBC News Online|BBC News]], 7 January 1999</ref> charges later supported by [[Scott Ritter]] and Bill Tierney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12304324&method=full&siteid=50143 |title=Inspector a US spy |accessdate=25 January 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030225093525/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12304324&method=full&siteid=50143 |archivedate=25 February 2003  }} ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', February 2003</ref>\n\nIn a 2005 interview Ritter criticized the Clinton administration's use of a blocked inspection of a Ba'ath party headquarters to justify the bombing.\n\n{{quote|Public perception is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking the work of the inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, \"Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq.\" So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.\n\nIn 1998, the inspection team went to a site. It was the Baath Party headquarters, like going to Republican Party headquarters or Democratic Party headquarters. The Iraqis said, \"You can't come in \u2013 you can come in. Come on in.\" The inspectors said, \"The modalities no longer apply.\" The Iraqis said, \"If you don't agree to the modalities, we can't support letting you in,\" and the Iraqis wouldn't allow the inspections to take place.\n\nBill Clinton said, \"This proves the Iraqis are not cooperating,\" and he ordered the inspectors out. But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors to withdraw from the modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took Iraqis by surprise.

The official rationale for Desert Fox may remain the \"degrading\" of Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction and the \"diminishing\" of the Iraqi threat to its neighbours. But careful study of the target list tells another story.\n\nThirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait.\n\nThe heart of the Desert Fox list (49 of the 100 targets) is the Iraqi regime itself: a half-dozen palace strongholds and their supporting cast of secret police, guard and transport organizations.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/analysis.htm The Difference Was in the Details] [[The Washington Post]], January 17, 1999</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] personnel with whom Arkin spoke, [[United States Central Command|Central Command]] chief [[Anthony Zinni]] insisted that the U.S. only attack biological and chemical sites that \"had been identified with a high degree of certainty.\" And the reason for the low number of targets, said Arkin, was because intelligence specialists \"could not identify actual weapons sites with enough specificity to comply with Zinni's directive.\"\n\nDr. Brian Jones was the top intelligence analyst on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/07_july/11/panorama.shtml Dr Brian Jones \"confused\" by Prime Minister's evidence to Hutton], BBC, 11 July 2004</ref> He told [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 2004 that [[Defence Intelligence Staff]] in [[Whitehall]] did not have a high degree of confidence ''any'' of the facilities identified, targeted and bombed in [[Operation Desert Fox]] were active in producing weapons of mass destruction. Jones' testimony is supported by the former Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence, [[John Morrison (British Intelligence Official)|John Morrison]], who informed the same program that, before the operation had ended, DIS came under pressure to validate a prepared statement to be delivered by then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], declaring military activity an unqualified success. Large-scale damage assessment takes time, responded Morrison, therefore his department declined to sign up to a premature statement. \"After Desert Fox, I actually sent a note round to all the analysts involved congratulating them on standing firm in the face of, in some cases, individual pressure to say things that they knew weren't true\". Later on, after careful assessment and consideration, Defence Intelligence Staff determined that the bombing had not been all that effective.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3850979.stm A failure of intelligence], [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]], 9 July 2004</ref>\n\nWithin days of speaking out on the program, Morrison was informed by former [[Labour Party (UK)|New Labour]] cabinet minister [[Ann Taylor, Baroness Taylor of Bolton|Ann Taylor]] that he was to lose his job as Chief Investigator to the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3960813.stm Axed intelligence expert defiant], [[BBC News Online|BBC News]], 28 October 2004</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3555880.stm What the Papers say - A failure of intelligence] [[BBC News Online|BBC News]], 11 August 2004</ref>\n\nThe [[Iraq Survey Group|Duelfer Report]] concluded in 2004 that Iraq's WMD capability \"was essentially destroyed in 1991\" following the end of sanctions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duelfer|first1=Charles|title=Comprehensive Report of the Special Adviser to the DCI on Iraq's WMD|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-DUELFERREPORT/pdf/GPO-DUELFERREPORT-1.pdf|publisher=Government Publishing Office}}</ref>{{rp|1}}\n\n===Distraction from Clinton impeachment scandal===\nSome critics of the Clinton administration, including Republican members of Congress,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2006/09/25/7679/wag-the-dog/|title=FLASHBACK: Conservative Lawmakers Decried Clinton's Attacks Against Osama As 'Wag the Dog' - ThinkProgress|work=ThinkProgress}}</ref> expressed concern over the timing of Operation Desert Fox.<ref>Hitchens, Christopher. \"No One Left to Lie To\" Verso. 1999</ref> The four-day bombing campaign occurred at the same time the U.S. House of Representatives was conducting the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment hearing of President Clinton]].  Clinton was impeached by the House on 19 December, the last day of the bombing campaign. A few months earlier, similar criticism was levelled during [[Operation Infinite Reach]], wherein missile strikes were ordered against suspected terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan, on 20 August. The missile strikes began three days after Clinton was called to testify before a grand jury during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] and his subsequent nationally televised address later that evening in which Clinton admitted having an inappropriate relationship.\n\nThe Operation Infinite Reach attacks became known as \"Monica's War\" among TV news people, due to the timing. ABC-TV announced to all stations that there would be a [[special report]] following Lewinsky's testimony before Congress, then the special report was pre-empted by the report of the missile attacks. The combination of the timing of that attack and Operation Desert Fox led to accusations of a ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' situation.\n\n===Criticism of the extent of the operation===\nOther critics, such as former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], said the attacks did not go far enough: \"I would be amazed if a three-day campaign made a decisive difference,\" Kissinger said just after the operation ended.\n\n<blockquote>[W]e did not do, in my view, enough damage to degrade it [Iraq's programs for weapons of mass destruction] for six months. It doesn't make any significant difference because in six months to a year they will be back to where they are and we cannot keep repeating these attacks.

The contemporaneous justification for the strikes was Iraq's failure to comply with [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions and its interference with [[United Nations Special Commission]] inspectors.\n\nThe operation was a major flare-up in the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]]. The stated goal of the [[cruise missile]] and bombing attacks was to strike military and security targets in Iraq that contributed to Iraq's ability to produce, store, maintain, and deliver [[weapons of mass destruction]].

Despite the act's intention of support of opposition groups, Clinton justified his order for US action under the act.\n\nThe act also stated that:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize or otherwise speak to the use of United States Armed Forces (except as provided in section 4(a)(2)) in carrying out this Act.</blockquote>\n\nSection 4(a)(2) states:\n\n<blockquote>The President is authorized to direct the drawdown of defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, defense services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training for [Iraqi democratic opposition] organizations.</blockquote>\n\nJust prior to Desert Fox, the U.S. nearly led a bombing campaign against Saddam called [[Operation Desert Thunder]].

Operation Desert Fox inflicted serious damage to Iraq's missile development program, although its effects on any WMD program were not clear. Nevertheless, Operation Desert Fox was the largest strike against Iraq since the early 1990s Persian Gulf War, until the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n97 sites were targeted in the operation with 415 cruise missiles and 600 bombs, including 11 weapons production or storage facilities, 18 security facilities for weapons, 9 military installations, 20 government CCC facilities, 32 surface-to-air missile batteries, 6 airfields, and 1 oil refinery. According to U.S. Defense Department assessments on 20 December 10 of these targets were destroyed, 18 severely damaged, 18 moderately damaged, 18 lightly damaged, and 23 not yet assessed. According to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, the allied action killed (62) or wounded (180) some 242 Iraqi military personnel. American General Harry Shelton told the U.S. Senate on 5 January 1999, however, that the strikes killed or wounded an estimated 1,400 members of Iraq's Republican Guard.<ref>Carrington, Anca. \"Iraq: Issues, Historical Background, Bibliography.\" Page 16.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nIn reaction to the attack, three of five permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]] (Russia, France, and the People's Republic of China) called for lifting of the eight-year oil embargo on Iraq, recasting or disbanding [[United Nations Special Commission|UNSCOM]], and firing its chairman, Australian [[diplomat]] [[Richard Butler (diplomat)|Richard Butler]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Accusations of U.S. interference in the U.N. inspection process===\nIraq stopped cooperating with the U.N. special commission in the first month of 1998, but diplomacy by [[Kofi Annan]] brought fresh agreement and new modalities for the inspection of sensitive sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/23/iraq.deal.update.4am/index.html Annan, Iraq sign weapons-inspection deal] [[CNN]], 23 February 1998</ref> Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] had earlier accused UNSCOM officials of acting as spies for the United States,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/crisis_in_the_gulf/latest_news/250188.stm Iraq applauds spy claims] [[BBC News Online|BBC News]], 7 January 1999</ref> charges later supported by [[Scott Ritter]] and Bill Tierney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12304324&method=full&siteid=50143 |title=Inspector a US spy |accessdate=25 January 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030225093525/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12304324&method=full&siteid=50143 |archivedate=25 February 2003  }} ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', February 2003</ref>\n\nIn a 2005 interview Ritter criticized the Clinton administration's use of a blocked inspection of a Ba'ath party headquarters to justify the bombing.\n\n{{quote|Public perception is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking the work of the inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, \"Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq.\" So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.\n\nIn 1998, the inspection team went to a site. It was the Baath Party headquarters, like going to Republican Party headquarters or Democratic Party headquarters. The Iraqis said, \"You can't come in \u2013 you can come in. Come on in.\" The inspectors said, \"The modalities no longer apply.\" The Iraqis said, \"If you don't agree to the modalities, we can't support letting you in,\" and the Iraqis wouldn't allow the inspections to take place.\n\nBill Clinton said, \"This proves the Iraqis are not cooperating,\" and he ordered the inspectors out. But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors to withdraw from the modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took Iraqis by surprise. Iraqis were saying, \"We're playing by the rules, why aren\u2019t you? If you're not going play by the rules, then it\u2019s a game that we don't want to participate in.\" Bill Clinton ordered the inspectors out.

The official rationale for Desert Fox may remain the \"degrading\" of Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction and the \"diminishing\" of the Iraqi threat to its neighbours. But careful study of the target list tells another story.\n\nThirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait.\n\nThe heart of the Desert Fox list (49 of the 100 targets) is the Iraqi regime itself: a half-dozen palace strongholds and their supporting cast of secret police, guard and transport organizations.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/analysis.htm The Difference Was in the Details] [[The Washington Post]], January 17, 1999</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] personnel with whom Arkin spoke, [[United States Central Command|Central Command]] chief [[Anthony Zinni]] insisted that the U.S. only attack biological and chemical sites that \"had been identified with a high degree of certainty.\" And the reason for the low number of targets, said Arkin, was because intelligence specialists \"could not identify actual weapons sites with enough specificity to comply with Zinni's directive.\"\n\nDr. Brian Jones was the top intelligence analyst on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/07_july/11/panorama.shtml Dr Brian Jones \"confused\" by Prime Minister's evidence to Hutton], BBC, 11 July 2004</ref> He told [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 2004 that [[Defence Intelligence Staff]] in [[Whitehall]] did not have a high degree of confidence ''any'' of the facilities identified, targeted and bombed in [[Operation Desert Fox]] were active in producing weapons of mass destruction. Jones' testimony is supported by the former Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence, [[John Morrison (British Intelligence Official)|John Morrison]], who informed the same program that, before the operation had ended, DIS came under pressure to validate a prepared statement to be delivered by then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], declaring military activity an unqualified success. Large-scale damage assessment takes time, responded Morrison, therefore his department declined to sign up to a premature statement. \"After Desert Fox, I actually sent a note round to all the analysts involved congratulating them on standing firm in the face of, in some cases, individual pressure to say things that they knew weren't true\".

Clinton was impeached by the House on 19 December, the last day of the bombing campaign. A few months earlier, similar criticism was levelled during [[Operation Infinite Reach]], wherein missile strikes were ordered against suspected terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan, on 20 August. The missile strikes began three days after Clinton was called to testify before a grand jury during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] and his subsequent nationally televised address later that evening in which Clinton admitted having an inappropriate relationship.\n\nThe Operation Infinite Reach attacks became known as \"Monica's War\" among TV news people, due to the timing. ABC-TV announced to all stations that there would be a [[special report]] following Lewinsky's testimony before Congress, then the special report was pre-empted by the report of the missile attacks. The combination of the timing of that attack and Operation Desert Fox led to accusations of a ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' situation.\n\n===Criticism of the extent of the operation===\nOther critics, such as former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], said the attacks did not go far enough: \"I would be amazed if a three-day campaign made a decisive difference,\" Kissinger said just after the operation ended.\n\n<blockquote>[W]e did not do, in my view, enough damage to degrade it [Iraq's programs for weapons of mass destruction] for six months. It doesn't make any significant difference because in six months to a year they will be back to where they are and we cannot keep repeating these attacks.

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

In 1841 Sharmarke with 50 [[Matchlock]] men, 2 [[cannons]] and an army of mounted spearmen managed to invade Zeila and depose its Arab Governor, Mohammed Al Barr. Sharmarke used the canons to fire at the city walls which frightened Al Barr's followers and caused them to flee. Sharmarke succeeded Al Barr as the ruler of Zeila and its dependencies.<ref>First footseps in to Africa, by Richard Burton, p.16-p.30</ref><ref> Sun, sand and Somals; leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland, by Rayne Henry. p.15-16</ref> Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden.<ref>Ethiopia: the Era of the Princes: The Challenge of Islam and Re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855. p.18 </ref> Having secured Zeila, in 1845 Sharmarke moved on to Berbera which at the time was experiencing instability as a result of a war between the [[Habr Awal]] Reer Yunis Nur and Reer Ahmed Nur sub-clans over the control of Berbera's trade. Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F.

This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]]. Among the prominent members of the Dervish was the Sultan of the Habar Yunis, [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], whose letter to [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] initiated the Dervish rebillion. Nur was the principle agitator that rallied the dervish behind his anti-French [[Catholic missions|Catholic Mission]] campaign that would become the cause of the dervish uprise.<ref>Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British. These confrontations took place at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo, Daratoleh and Gumburu. In 1899 Sultan Nur was among the top five (Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, [[Haji Sudi]], Deria Arrale and Deria Gure) wanted leaders of the movement.<ref>Official history of the operations in Somaliland, 1901\u201304 by Great Britain.

In his article Macfayden only identified Sultan Nur's tomb by name out of the four dervish entombed in Taleh:\n\n<blockquote>\"South of the main cave-well is the considerable tomb of Abdullah Hasan\nsenior, well plastered inside and out; it is now said to be empty.

The Gadwein Dervishes who were located in coastal [[Sanaag]] and the towns of  [[Midisho]] and Jidali created complications for the Warsengeli Sultanate, who they regularly raided. The Warsengeli who were at that time allied with the British called for their assistance. Consequently, in 1912 the British sent the warship [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS Philomel]] and shelled the Gadwein Dervishes, pushing them from the coast and inland towards Las Dureh.<ref>Official History of the Operation Volume 1, p.49</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland , p.252-p.258</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/Mad%20Mullah%20of%20Northern%20Somaliland.pdf |title= The \"Mad Mullah\" and Northern Somalia,by Robert L.Hess|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"kings coll1\">{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/armies-abroad/dervish-state/establishment#Gallery[gallery1]/1/ |title= King's College London, King's collection: Ismay's summary as Intelligence Officer (1916-1918) of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|first=}}</ref> The Dervish forces of Sanaag were supplied with arms and munitions by two Habr Yunis men of the Musa Arreh clan, namely, Haji Hirsi of [[Maydh]] and Bulhan Ali, they both operated with in [[Yemen]], the former being stationed at [[Mukalla]] and the latter at [[Aden]].

From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.<ref>1922 Commons sitting.

His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug in which he successfully led the Eidagale in battle and defeated the Absame tribes, permanently pushing them out of present-day Waqooyi Galbeed region. After witnessing his leadership skills, noble conduct and valiance, the Isaaq chiefs recognized him as their Grand Sultan. Guled's Sultanate predates the Habr Yunis Sultanate, which broke off from Eidagale tutelage several decades after the start of his rule. Sultan Guled ruled the Isaaq from the 1750's up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah. Sultan Farah further expanded the influence of the Sultanate by establishing ties with various Muslim polities across the Gulf, particularly the [[Al-Qasimi]] family whom he regularly corresponded with in regard to military action against the British Navy who blockaded Berbera and threatening to cut off vital trade.<ref>http://t-3abersbeelculture.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_14.html?m=1</ref> \n\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint [[Aw Barkhadle]], which is located between [[Berbera]] and [[Hargeisa]], was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]].

The Kingdom's territory encompassed the lands settled by the Habr Yunis tribe of the Garhajis clan. The Habr Yunis Sultans received a tax in the form of an annual tribute of livestock from their subjects and they regularly taxed the trade caravans that went through their territory. Moreover, the sultanate had a significant standing army which was used to enforce the taxation, as well as to defend their realm.<ref > The Journal of The anthropological institute of Great Britain and Ireland| Vol.21 p. 161 </ref><ref > Journal of the East Africa Natural History Society: Official Publication of the Coryndon Memorial Museum Vol.17 p. 76</ref> \n\nThe first Habr Yunis chief to assume the title Sultan was Sugulleh Ainanshe of the Ismail Arrah clan, his father Ainanshe was a traditional chief. Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Habar Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F.

This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]]. Among the prominent members of the Dervish was the Sultan of the Habar Yunis, [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], whose letter to [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] initiated the Dervish rebillion. Nur was the principle agitator that rallied the dervish behind his anti-French [[Catholic missions|Catholic Mission]] campaign that would become the cause of the dervish uprise.<ref>Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British. These confrontations took place at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo, Daratoleh and Gumburu. In 1899 Sultan Nur was among the top five (Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, [[Haji Sudi]], Deria Arrale and Deria Gure) wanted leaders of the movement.<ref>Official history of the operations in Somaliland, 1901\u201304 by Great Britain.

The Gadwein Dervishes who were located in coastal [[Sanaag]] and the towns of  [[Midisho]] and Jidali created complications for the Warsengeli Sultanate, who they regularly raided. The Warsengeli who were at that time allied with the British called for their assistance. Consequently, in 1912 the British sent the warship [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS Philomel]] and shelled the Gadwein Dervishes, pushing them from the coast and inland towards Las Dureh.<ref>Official History of the Operation Volume 1, p.49</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland , p.252-p.258</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/Mad%20Mullah%20of%20Northern%20Somaliland.pdf |title= The \"Mad Mullah\" and Northern Somalia,by Robert L.Hess|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"kings coll1\">{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/armies-abroad/dervish-state/establishment#Gallery[gallery1]/1/ |title= King's College London, King's collection: Ismay's summary as Intelligence Officer (1916-1918) of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|first=}}</ref> The Dervish forces of Sanaag were supplied with arms and munitions by two Habr Yunis men of the Musa Arreh clan, namely, Haji Hirsi of [[Maydh]] and Bulhan Ali, they both operated with in [[Yemen]], the former being stationed at [[Mukalla]] and the latter at [[Aden]].

Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.\nCaptain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.<ref>1922 Commons sitting.

The Isaaq Sultanate was established in the mid-18th century by Sultan Guled Abdi Eise of the Eidagale clan. His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug in which he successfully led the Eidagale in battle and defeated the Absame tribes, permanently pushing them out of present-day Waqooyi Galbeed region. After witnessing his leadership skills, noble conduct and valiance, the Isaaq chiefs recognized him as their Grand Sultan. Guled's Sultanate predates the Habr Yunis Sultanate, which broke off from Eidagale tutelage several decades after the start of his rule. Sultan Guled ruled the Isaaq from the 1750's up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah. Sultan Farah further expanded the influence of the Sultanate by establishing ties with various Muslim polities across the Gulf, particularly the [[Al-Qasimi]] family whom he regularly corresponded with in regard to military action against the British Navy who blockaded Berbera and threatening to cut off vital trade.<ref>http://t-3abersbeelculture.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_14.html?m=1</ref> \n\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint [[Aw Barkhadle]], which is located between [[Berbera]] and [[Hargeisa]], was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]].

The Kingdom's territory encompassed the lands settled by the Habr Yunis tribe of the Garhajis clan. The Habr Yunis Sultans received a tax in the form of an annual tribute of livestock from their subjects and they regularly taxed the trade caravans that went through their territory. Moreover, the sultanate had a significant standing army which was used to enforce the taxation, as well as to defend their realm.<ref > The Journal of The anthropological institute of Great Britain and Ireland| Vol.21 p. 161 </ref><ref > Journal of the East Africa Natural History Society: Official Publication of the Coryndon Memorial Museum Vol.17 p. 76</ref> \n\nThe first Habr Yunis chief to assume the title Sultan was Sugulleh Ainanshe of the Ismail Arrah clan, his father Ainanshe was a traditional chief. Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Isaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Habar Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;
