Since many of the legends being related also concern the acts of mythic and legendary figures, the ''dindsenchas'' has been an important source for the study of [[Irish mythology]]. \n\n==Works==\nThe literary corpus of the ''dindsenchas'' comprises about 176 poems plus a number of prose commentaries and independent prose tales (the so-called \"prose ''dindsenchas''\" is often distinguished from the \"verse\", \"poetic\" or \"metrical ''dindsenchas''\"). As a compilation the ''dindsenchas'' has survived in two different [[:wikt:recension|recensions]]. The first recension is found in the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'', a manuscript of the 12th century, with partial survivals in a number of other manuscript sources. The text shows signs of having been compiled from a number of provincial sources and the earliest poems date from at least the 11th century. The second recension survives more or less intact in thirteen different manuscripts, mostly dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. This recension contains a number of poems composed after the Book of Leinster text. ''Dindsenchas'' stories are also incorporated into saga texts such as ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' and ''[[Acallam na Sen\u00f3rach]]''.\n\nAlthough they are known today from these written sources, the ''dindsenchas'' are clearly a product of [[oral literature]] and are structured so as to be a [[mnemonic aid]] as well as a form of entertainment. They are far from an accurate history of how places came to be named. Many of the explanations given are made to fit the name and not the other way around, especially in the many cases where a place was much older than the [[Middle Irish]] spoken at the time of the poems' composition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maryjones.us/jce/dindsenchas.html |title=Jones Celtic Encyclopedia: Dindsenchas |access-date=2006-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410013201/http://www.maryjones.us/jce/dindsenchas.html |archive-date=2018-04-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In other cases, the ''dindsenchas'' poets may have invented names for places when the name of a place, if it had one, was not known to them. A detailed analysis points to a pre-Christian origin for most of the tales. For example, many placenames appear which had fallen out of use by the 5th century A.D., when Irish written records began to appear in quantity.

In 1912 the region was divided between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. The most populous city in the region is [[Novi Pazar]] in Serbia. \n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Sand\u017eak'' is the transcription of Turkish ''sancak'' ([[sanjak]], \"province\");<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sanjak|title=Dictionary.com - Sanjak entry|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], known in Serbo-Croatian as ''Novopazarski sand\u017eak''.

During the Ottoman rule, many inhabitants converted to Islam. The conversions were caused by number of factors, mainly economic as Muslims paid lower taxes.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=328}} The Muslims were also privileged compared to Christians, who were unable to work in the administration or testify in court against Muslims.{{sfn|Todorovi\u0107|2012|p=13}} The second factor that contributed to the Islamisation were migrations. A large demographic shift occurred as Serbs fought several wars against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks drove the Christian population northwards, while Muslims were driven to the Ottoman territory. The land abandoned by the Serbs was settled by Muslims, mainly ethnic Serbs who confessed Islam and Turks, but also significant population from the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Asia Minor. Large migrations occurred throughout the 18th and 19th century. The third factor of Islamisation was the geographical location of Sand\u017eak, which allowed it to become a trade centre, facilitating conversions amongst merchants.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=328&ndash;329}}\n[[File:Sanjak of Novibazar.png|thumb|left|Sanjak of Novi Pazar in 1878.]]\nThe second half of the 19th century was very important in terms of shaping the current ethnic and political situation in Sand\u017eak. [[Austria-Hungary]] supported Sand\u017eak's separation from the Ottoman Empire, or at least its autonomy within it. The reason was to prevent Serbia and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] from unifying, and allow Austria-Hungary's further expansion to the Balkans. Per these plans, Sand\u017eak was seen as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while its Muslim population played a significant role giving Austrian-Hungarians a pretext of protecting the Muslim minority from the Christian Orthodox Serbs.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=329}}\n\nAdministratively, it was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]] until 1790, when it become a separated [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, in 1867, it become a part of the [[Bosnia Vilayet]] that consisted of seven sanjaks, including the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. This led to Sand\u017eak Muslims identifying themselves with other Slavic Muslims in Bosnia.{{sfn|Todorovi\u0107|2012|p=11}}\n\nIn October 1912, Sand\u017eak was captured by Serbian and Montenegrin troops in the [[First Balkan War]], and its territory was divided between [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm|title=The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878\u20131909|publisher=Mount HolyOak|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> Many Slavic Muslims and Albanian inhabitants of Sand\u017eak emigrated to [[Turkey]] as [[Muhajir (Turkey)|muhajirs]]. There are numerous colonies of Sand\u017eak Bosniaks in Turkey, in and around [[Edirne]], [[Istanbul]], [[Adapazar\u0131]], [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]], and [[Samsun]], among other places. During [[World War I]], Sand\u017eak was occupied by [[Austria-Hungary]] between 1915 and 1918, as it had been previously between 1878 and 1908. Following World War I, it was included in the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. It was a link between the Muslims in the West in Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in the East in Kosovo and Macedonia. Sand\u017eak was the only region in Serbia populated by the Slavic Muslims.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=329}} The Sand\u017eak Muslims suffered from the loss of their economic status since the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and during the agrarian reform carried out in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This led to the Muslim emigrations to the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}}\n[[File:Partisans enter Novi Pazar.jpg|thumbnail|Partisans enter Novi Pazar]]\n[[File:Sandzak 1943 1945 en.png|thumb|Area under jurisdiction of the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Sand\u017eak (ZAVNOS), 1943-1945.]]\nThe new communist regime in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] found Sand\u017eak with the Slavic Muslim minority of 43% and the Serb majority of 56%, along with smaller Albanian and Catholic minorities. During the World War II, until its abolition, Sand\u017eak had an equal status to other federal units.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=100}} The Muslims, who had generally anti-Partisan attitude, wanted unification of Sand\u017eak with Bosnia and Herzegovina, or at least to be taken as a whole either by Serbia or Montenegro. However, Sand\u017eak was later divided between Serbia and Montenegro, the outcome the Muslims wanted the least.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=100&ndash;101}}\n\nThe Anti-Fascist Council of People's Liberation of Sand\u017eak (AVNOS) had been founded on 20 November 1943 in [[Pljevlja]].{{sfn|Jeli\u0107|Strugar|1985|p=82, 134}} In January 1944, the Land Assembly of Montenegro and the Bay of Kotor cited Sand\u017eak as part of a future Montenegrin federal unit. However, in March, the Communist Party opposed this, insisting that Sand\u017eak's representatives at AVNOJ should decide on the matter.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=101}} In February 1945, the Presidency of the AVNOJ made a decision to oppose the Sand\u017eak's autonomy. The AVNOJ explained that the Sand\u017eak hadn't a national basis for an autonomy and opposed crumbling of the Serbian and Montenegrin totality.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=102}} On 29 March 1945 in [[Novi Pazar]], the AVNOS accepted the decision of the AVNOJ and divided itself between Serbia and Montenegro.{{sfn|Jeli\u0107|Strugar|1985|p=144}} Sand\u017eak was divided based on the 1912 demarcation line.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=102}}\n\nEconomically, Sand\u017eak remained undeveloped. It had a small amount of crude and low-revenue industry. Freight was transported by trucks over poor roads. Schools for business students, which remained poor in general education, were opened for working-class youth. The Sand\u017eak had no faculty, not even a department or any school of higher education.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}}\n\nSand\u017eak saw a process of industrialisation, during which factories were opened in several cities, including Novi Pazar, Prijepolje, [[Priboj]], [[Berane|Ivangrad]], while the coal mines were opened in the Prijepolje area. The urbanisation caused a major social and economic shift. Many people left villages for towns. The national composition of the urban centres was changed to the disadvantage of the Muslims, as most of those who inhabited the cities were Serbs. The Muslims continued to lose their economic status, continuing the trend inherited from the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the agrarian reform in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}} The emigration of the Muslims to [[Turkey]] also continued, caused by the general underdevelopment of the region, disagreement with the communist authorities and the mistrust with the Serbs and Montenegrins, but also due to the nationalisation and expropriation of property. Serbs from Sand\u017eak also moved to the wealthier regions of the central Serbia or to [[Belgrade]] or [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], while the Muslims moved to [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as well.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=133}}\n\nWith the democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, the ethnic Bosniaks were enabled to start participating in the political life in Serbia and Montenegro, including [[Rasim Ljaji\u0107]], an ethnic Bosniak, who was a minister in the Government of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and [[Rifat Rastoder]], who is the Deputy President of the Parliament of Montenegro. Census data shows a general emigration of all nationalities from this underdeveloped region.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nSand\u017eak is a very ethnically diverse region. Most Bosniaks declared themselves [[Muslims by nationality]] in 1991 census. By the 2002-2003 census, however, most of them declared themselves Bosniaks. There is still a significant minority that identify as Muslims by nationality. There are still some Albanian villages (Boro\u0161tica, Doli\u0107e and Ugao) in the Pe\u0161ter region.<ref name = Pieroni/> Factors such as some intermarriage undertaken by two generations with the surrounding Bosniak population along with the difficult circumstances of the Yugoslav wars (1990s) made local Albanians opt to refer to themselves in censuses as ''Bosniaks''.<ref name = Pieroni>Andrea Pieroni, Maria Elena Giusti, & Cassandra L.

(3): 335. \"The current population of the Albanian villages is partly \"bosniakicised\", since in the last two generations a number of Albanian males began to intermarry with (Muslim) Bosniak women of Pe\u0161ter. This is one of the reasons why locals in Ugao were declared to be \"Bosniaks\" in the last census of 2002, or, in Boro\u0161tica, to be simply \"Muslims\", and in both cases abandoning the previous ethnic label of \"Albanians\", which these villages used in the census conducted during \"Yugoslavian\" times. A number of our informants confirmed that the self-attribution \"Albanian\" was purposely abandoned in order to avoid problems following the Yugoslav Wars and associated violent incursions of Serbian para-military forces in the area. The oldest generation of the villagers however are still fluent in a dialect of Ghegh Albanian, which appears to have been neglected by European linguists thus far. Additionally, the presence of an Albanian minority in this area has never been brought to the attention of international stakeholders by either the former Yugoslav or the current Serbian authorities.\"</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Sandzak ethnic map.png|Ethnic map of Sand\u017eak (including [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Andrijevica]]) according to the 2002 census in Serbia and 2003 census in Montenegro.

Sand\u017eak derives from the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], a former Ottoman administrative district. [[Serbs]] refer to the northern part of the region by its medieval name [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. \n\nBetween 1878 and 1909 the region was placed under [[Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, following which it was ceded back to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1912 the region was divided between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. The most populous city in the region is [[Novi Pazar]] in Serbia. \n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Sand\u017eak'' is the transcription of Turkish ''sancak'' ([[sanjak]], \"province\");<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sanjak|title=Dictionary.com - Sanjak entry|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], known in Serbo-Croatian as ''Novopazarski sand\u017eak''.

During the Ottoman rule, many inhabitants converted to Islam. The conversions were caused by number of factors, mainly economic as Muslims paid lower taxes.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=328}} The Muslims were also privileged compared to Christians, who were unable to work in the administration or testify in court against Muslims.{{sfn|Todorovi\u0107|2012|p=13}} The second factor that contributed to the Islamisation were migrations. A large demographic shift occurred as Serbs fought several wars against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks drove the Christian population northwards, while Muslims were driven to the Ottoman territory. The land abandoned by the Serbs was settled by Muslims, mainly ethnic Serbs who confessed Islam and Turks, but also significant population from the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Asia Minor. Large migrations occurred throughout the 18th and 19th century. The third factor of Islamisation was the geographical location of Sand\u017eak, which allowed it to become a trade centre, facilitating conversions amongst merchants.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=328&ndash;329}}\n[[File:Sanjak of Novibazar.png|thumb|left|Sanjak of Novi Pazar in 1878.]]\nThe second half of the 19th century was very important in terms of shaping the current ethnic and political situation in Sand\u017eak. [[Austria-Hungary]] supported Sand\u017eak's separation from the Ottoman Empire, or at least its autonomy within it. The reason was to prevent Serbia and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] from unifying, and allow Austria-Hungary's further expansion to the Balkans. Per these plans, Sand\u017eak was seen as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while its Muslim population played a significant role giving Austrian-Hungarians a pretext of protecting the Muslim minority from the Christian Orthodox Serbs.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=329}}\n\nAdministratively, it was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]] until 1790, when it become a separated [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, in 1867, it become a part of the [[Bosnia Vilayet]] that consisted of seven sanjaks, including the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. This led to Sand\u017eak Muslims identifying themselves with other Slavic Muslims in Bosnia.{{sfn|Todorovi\u0107|2012|p=11}}\n\nIn October 1912, Sand\u017eak was captured by Serbian and Montenegrin troops in the [[First Balkan War]], and its territory was divided between [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm|title=The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878\u20131909|publisher=Mount HolyOak|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> Many Slavic Muslims and Albanian inhabitants of Sand\u017eak emigrated to [[Turkey]] as [[Muhajir (Turkey)|muhajirs]]. There are numerous colonies of Sand\u017eak Bosniaks in Turkey, in and around [[Edirne]], [[Istanbul]], [[Adapazar\u0131]], [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]], and [[Samsun]], among other places. During [[World War I]], Sand\u017eak was occupied by [[Austria-Hungary]] between 1915 and 1918, as it had been previously between 1878 and 1908. Following World War I, it was included in the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. It was a link between the Muslims in the West in Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in the East in Kosovo and Macedonia. Sand\u017eak was the only region in Serbia populated by the Slavic Muslims.{{sfn|G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|2011|p=329}} The Sand\u017eak Muslims suffered from the loss of their economic status since the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and during the agrarian reform carried out in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This led to the Muslim emigrations to the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}}\n[[File:Partisans enter Novi Pazar.jpg|thumbnail|Partisans enter Novi Pazar]]\n[[File:Sandzak 1943 1945 en.png|thumb|Area under jurisdiction of the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Sand\u017eak (ZAVNOS), 1943-1945.]]\nThe new communist regime in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] found Sand\u017eak with the Slavic Muslim minority of 43% and the Serb majority of 56%, along with smaller Albanian and Catholic minorities. During the World War II, until its abolition, Sand\u017eak had an equal status to other federal units.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=100}} The Muslims, who had generally anti-Partisan attitude, wanted unification of Sand\u017eak with Bosnia and Herzegovina, or at least to be taken as a whole either by Serbia or Montenegro. However, Sand\u017eak was later divided between Serbia and Montenegro, the outcome the Muslims wanted the least.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=100&ndash;101}}\n\nThe Anti-Fascist Council of People's Liberation of Sand\u017eak (AVNOS) had been founded on 20 November 1943 in [[Pljevlja]].{{sfn|Jeli\u0107|Strugar|1985|p=82, 134}} In January 1944, the Land Assembly of Montenegro and the Bay of Kotor cited Sand\u017eak as part of a future Montenegrin federal unit. However, in March, the Communist Party opposed this, insisting that Sand\u017eak's representatives at AVNOJ should decide on the matter.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=101}} In February 1945, the Presidency of the AVNOJ made a decision to oppose the Sand\u017eak's autonomy. The AVNOJ explained that the Sand\u017eak hadn't a national basis for an autonomy and opposed crumbling of the Serbian and Montenegrin totality.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=102}} On 29 March 1945 in [[Novi Pazar]], the AVNOS accepted the decision of the AVNOJ and divided itself between Serbia and Montenegro.{{sfn|Jeli\u0107|Strugar|1985|p=144}} Sand\u017eak was divided based on the 1912 demarcation line.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=102}}\n\nEconomically, Sand\u017eak remained undeveloped. It had a small amount of crude and low-revenue industry. Freight was transported by trucks over poor roads. Schools for business students, which remained poor in general education, were opened for working-class youth. The Sand\u017eak had no faculty, not even a department or any school of higher education.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}}\n\nSand\u017eak saw a process of industrialisation, during which factories were opened in several cities, including Novi Pazar, Prijepolje, [[Priboj]], [[Berane|Ivangrad]], while the coal mines were opened in the Prijepolje area. The urbanisation caused a major social and economic shift. Many people left villages for towns. The national composition of the urban centres was changed to the disadvantage of the Muslims, as most of those who inhabited the cities were Serbs. The Muslims continued to lose their economic status, continuing the trend inherited from the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the agrarian reform in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=132}} The emigration of the Muslims to [[Turkey]] also continued, caused by the general underdevelopment of the region, disagreement with the communist authorities and the mistrust with the Serbs and Montenegrins, but also due to the nationalisation and expropriation of property. Serbs from Sand\u017eak also moved to the wealthier regions of the central Serbia or to [[Belgrade]] or [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], while the Muslims moved to [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as well.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0161ehovi\u0107|Butler|Risaluddin|2003|p=133}}\n\nWith the democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, the ethnic Bosniaks were enabled to start participating in the political life in Serbia and Montenegro, including [[Rasim Ljaji\u0107]], an ethnic Bosniak, who was a minister in the Government of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and [[Rifat Rastoder]], who is the Deputy President of the Parliament of Montenegro. Census data shows a general emigration of all nationalities from this underdeveloped region.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nSand\u017eak is a very ethnically diverse region. Most Bosniaks declared themselves [[Muslims by nationality]] in 1991 census. By the 2002-2003 census, however, most of them declared themselves Bosniaks. There is still a significant minority that identify as Muslims by nationality. There are still some Albanian villages (Boro\u0161tica, Doli\u0107e and Ugao) in the Pe\u0161ter region.<ref name = Pieroni/> Factors such as some intermarriage undertaken by two generations with the surrounding Bosniak population along with the difficult circumstances of the Yugoslav wars (1990s) made local Albanians opt to refer to themselves in censuses as ''Bosniaks''.<ref name = Pieroni>Andrea Pieroni, Maria Elena Giusti, & Cassandra L.

This is one of the reasons why locals in Ugao were declared to be \"Bosniaks\" in the last census of 2002, or, in Boro\u0161tica, to be simply \"Muslims\", and in both cases abandoning the previous ethnic label of \"Albanians\", which these villages used in the census conducted during \"Yugoslavian\" times. A number of our informants confirmed that the self-attribution \"Albanian\" was purposely abandoned in order to avoid problems following the Yugoslav Wars and associated violent incursions of Serbian para-military forces in the area. The oldest generation of the villagers however are still fluent in a dialect of Ghegh Albanian, which appears to have been neglected by European linguists thus far. Additionally, the presence of an Albanian minority in this area has never been brought to the attention of international stakeholders by either the former Yugoslav or the current Serbian authorities.\"</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Sandzak ethnic map.png|Ethnic map of Sand\u017eak (including [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Andrijevica]]) according to the 2002 census in Serbia and 2003 census in Montenegro.
