However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such an intervention.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Translation to Dalmatia and Italy===\nThe narrative further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously [[Translation (relic)|carried]] by [[angel]]s through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at [[Tersatto]] (now Trsat, a suburb of [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous [[miracle|miraculous]] cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of [[Dalmatia]]. In 1294, angels again carried it across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the woods near [[Recanati]] (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin ''lauretum'', Italian ''Colle dei Lauri'' or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. ''sacellum glorios\u00e6 Virginis in Laureto''). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title ''Our Lady of Loreto'', sometimels applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA more detailed narrative mentions five transitions: in May 1291 from Nazareth to Tersatto, where it remained for over three years; from there to the other side of the Adriatic Sea, to Posatora (now part of [[Ancona]]) in the Marche region; after nine months to woods near Recanati in Marche; after eight months to a hill a mile away, Monte Prodo, near Loreto, where local counts petition the pope for ownership of the pilgrimage site; and finally, at the end of 1296, to the current position on the road then connecting Recanati to Porto Recanati, on public ground free of property claims.<ref name=Ferreri/>\n\n==Papal support==\n[[papal bull|Bulls]] in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (''ut pie creditur et fama est''). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, [[Pope Innocent XII|Innocent XII]] appointed a ''missa cum officio proprio'' (a special [[mass]]) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the [[Spanish Breviary]] as a [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite#History|greater double]] on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 4 October 2012, [[Benedict XVI]] visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of [[John XXIII]]'s visit.

An early brief reference is made in the ''Italia Illustrata'' of [[Flavius Blondus]] (1392\u20131463), secretary to Popes [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene&nbsp;IV]], [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]] and [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]; it can be read in its entirety in the ''Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi\u00e6 Lauretana historia'', by a certain Teremannus, contained in the ''Opera Omnia'' (1576) of [[Mantuanus|Baptista Mantuanus]].\n\n====Transformation of Marian tradition====\nAccording to [[Herbert Thurston]], in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"''ut pie creditur et fama est''\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".<ref name=Thurston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13454b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Santa Casa di Loreto.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 December 2017</ref> Thurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersatto in [[Illyria]] (more precisely: Dalmatia) to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\n====Similar Walsingham legend====\nFinally, Thurston draws comparisons to the shrine at [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham]], the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. [[Edward the Confessor]] a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.<ref>\"The Month\", September 1901</ref>\n\n====Angeli/Angelos family====\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to a local aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer.<ref name=kerr>{{cite news |last= Kerr |first= David |title= Pope entrusts Year of Faith, evangelization synod to Mary |url= http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-entrusts-year-of-faith-evangelization-synod-to-mary/ |access-date=18 December 2012 |newspaper= Catholic News Agency |date=4 October 2012}}</ref> According to papal archivist Giuseppe Lapponi, it seems that a family by the name of Angeli saved the bricks of the Holy House from the Muslim invasion.

Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by [[Girolamo Lombardo]]; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them [[Tiburzio Vergelli]] (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze [[baptismal font|font]] in the interior.

However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such an intervention.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===To Dalmatia and Italy===\nThe narrative further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by [[angel]]s through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at [[Tersatto]] (now Trsat, a suburb of [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous [[miracle|miraculous]] cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of [[Dalmatia]]. In 1294, angels again carried it across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the woods near [[Recanati]] (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin ''lauretum'', Italian ''Colle dei Lauri'' or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. ''sacellum glorios\u00e6 Virginis in Laureto''). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title ''Our Lady of Loreto'', sometimels applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA more detailed narrative mentions five transitions: in May 1291 from Nazareth to Tersatto, where it remained for over three years; from there to the other side of the Adriatic Sea, to Posatora (now part of [[Ancona]]) in the Marche region; after nine months to woods near Recanati in Marche; after eight months to a hill a mile away, Monte Prodo, near Loreto, where local counts petition the pope for ownership of the pilgrimage site; and finally, at the end of 1296, to the current position on the road then connecting Recanati to Porto Recanati, on public ground free of property claims.<ref name=Ferreri/>\n\n==Papal support==\n[[papal bull|Bulls]] in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (''ut pie creditur et fama est''). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, [[Pope Innocent XII|Innocent XII]] appointed a ''missa cum officio proprio'' (a special [[mass]]) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the [[Spanish Breviary]] as a [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite#History|greater double]] on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 4 October 2012, [[Benedict XVI]] visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of [[John XXIII]]'s visit.

An early brief reference is made in the ''Italia Illustrata'' of [[Flavius Blondus]] (1392\u20131463), secretary to Popes [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene&nbsp;IV]], [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]] and [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]; it can be read in its entirety in the ''Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi\u00e6 Lauretana historia'', by a certain Teremannus, contained in the ''Opera Omnia'' (1576) of [[Mantuanus|Baptista Mantuanus]].\n\n====Transformation of Marian tradition====\nAccording to [[Herbert Thurston]], in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"''ut pie creditur et fama est''\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".<ref name=Thurston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13454b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Santa Casa di Loreto.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 December 2017</ref> Thurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersatto in [[Illyria]] (more precisely: Dalmatia) to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\n====Similar Walsingham legend====\nFinally, Thurston draws comparisons to the shrine at [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham]], the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. [[Edward the Confessor]] a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.<ref>\"The Month\", September 1901</ref>\n\n====Angeli/Angelos family====\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to a local aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer.<ref name=kerr>{{cite news |last= Kerr |first= David |title= Pope entrusts Year of Faith, evangelization synod to Mary |url= http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-entrusts-year-of-faith-evangelization-synod-to-mary/ |access-date=18 December 2012 |newspaper= Catholic News Agency |date=4 October 2012}}</ref> According to papal archivist Giuseppe Lapponi, it seems that a family by the name of Angeli saved the bricks of the Holy House from the Muslim invasion.

She worked for the [[University of Vienna]], eventually becoming the first female professor at the institution. While working with Ernst Foyn she published a paper on the radioactivity of seawater.  \nShe discovered that the element 85 [[astatine]] is a product of the natural decay processes. The element was first synthesized in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[K. R. MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], after several scientists in vain searched for it in radioactive minerals.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nBerta Karlik was born in [[Vienna]] to an upper-class family and was home-taught for her elementary education. While being taught at home she learned to play the piano as well as speak and write French, Dutch and English. From 1919 to 1923 she attended the Reform-Realgymnasium and upon graduating in 1923 she was accepted as a regular student to the Philosophical Faculty at the [[University of Vienna]] until 1928 when she received her Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto\">Tsoneva-Mathewson, S., M. F. Rayner-Canham, G. F. Rayner-Canham, A Devotion to Their Science: Pioneer Women of Radioactivity, (Eds. Rayner-Canham), McGill-Queen.s University Press (1997)</ref>\n\nWhile enrolled as a student at the university Karlik became an essential member of Hans Pettersson's research group at the Radium Institute with her specialty being the scintillation counter. Karlik also attended a fellowship from the International Federation of University Women which required her to travel while working for the Radium Institute.\n\nAfter receiving her degree in Physics Karlik accepted a teaching position at the Realgymnasium in Vienna, where she was a former pupil.\n\n=== Entering the Field ===\nIn 1930 Karlik found a job at a laboratory run by William Bragg in London. Here she worked on crystallography and used X-rays to study the structure of crystals. Karlik's knowledge of radiophysics attracted the attention of noted crystallographers [[Isabel Ellie Knaggs|Ellie Knaggs]] and Helen Gilchrist. The same year that she formed a group with these two women is the same year she first visits Marie Curie's lab in Paris which signaled the start of her long correspondence with various other female physicists.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nWhile Karlik occasionally sent letters to Marie Curie she kept regular correspondence with other notable physicists such as Ellen Gleditsch and Eva Resmtedt, two of the Curie researchers, as well as [[Lise Meitner]], with whom Karlik was quite close during her life. Throughout her life she would meet with Meitner who worked with the team responsible for discovering [[nuclear fission]].\n\n=== Research ===\nAfter studying in Paris and London she started working at the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna|Institut f\u00fcr Radiumforschung]] (Institut for Radium Research) in Vienna in 1931. From 1937 she was allowed to give lectures, and slowly advanced in the hierarchy of the institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lise.univie.ac.at/physikerinnen/historisch/berta-karlik.htm|title=Physikerin - Berta Karlik|website=lise.univie.ac.at}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously Karlik joined a group on seawater research headed by the Swedish physicist Hans Pettersson. Mixing knowledge of oceanography and radioactivity, Karlik helped to bring up concerns about the biological issue of uranium contamination of seawater.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the Second World War she made her most important discovery, that the element with the atomic number 85, Astatine, was a product of natural decay. Astatine's main use is in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells. Due to this discovery Karlik was awarded the [[Haitinger Prize]] for Chemistry from the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1947.\n\nShe became provisional director of the institute in 1945 and official in 1947 upon discovering the existence of astatine. Berta Karlik was the first woman to be full professor (\"ordentliche Professur\") at the University of Vienna in 1956. She retired in 1973, but worked at the institute till her death in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w-fforte.at/de/wissenschafft-leben/pionierinnen/berta-karlik.html|title=w-fFORTE: Berta Karlik|last=w-fFORTE|website=www.w-fforte.at}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications ===\n* \"An Alpha-Radiation Ascribed to Element 85,\" S.B.Akad.

She worked for the [[University of Vienna]], eventually becoming the first female professor at the institution. While working with Ernst Foyn she published a paper on the radioactivity of seawater.  \nShe discovered that the element 85 [[astatine]] is a product of the natural decay processes. The element was first synthesized in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[K. R. MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], after several scientists in vain searched for it in radioactive minerals.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nBerta Karlik was born in [[Vienna]] to an upper-class family and was home-taught for her elementary education. While being taught at home she learned to play the piano as well as speak and write French, Dutch and English. From 1919 to 1923 she attended the Reform-Realgymnasium and upon graduating in 1923 she was accepted as a regular student to the Philosophical Faculty at the [[University of Vienna]] until 1928 when she received her Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto\">Tsoneva-Mathewson, S., M. F. Rayner-Canham, G. F. Rayner-Canham, A Devotion to Their Science: Pioneer Women of Radioactivity, (Eds. Rayner-Canham), McGill-Queen.s University Press (1997)</ref>\n\nWhile enrolled as a student at the university Karlik became an essential member of Hans Pettersson's research group at the Radium Institute with her specialty being the scintillation counter. Karlik also attended a fellowship from the International Federation of University Women which required her to travel while working for the Radium Institute.\n\nAfter receiving her degree in Physics Karlik accepted a teaching position at the Realgymnasium in Vienna, where she was a former pupil.\n\n=== Entering the Field ===\nIn 1930 Karlik found a job at a laboratory run by William Bragg in London. Here she worked on crystallography and used X-rays to study the structure of crystals. Karlik's knowledge of radiophysics attracted the attention of noted crystallographers [[Isabel Ellie Knaggs|Ellie Knaggs]] and Helen Gilchrist. The same year that she formed a group with these two women is the same year she first visits Marie Curie's lab in Paris which signaled the start of her long correspondence with various other female physicists.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nWhile Karlik occasionally sent letters to Marie Curie she kept regular correspondence with other notable physicists such as Ellen Gleditsch and Eva Resmtedt, two of the Curie researchers, as well as [[Lise Meitner]], with whom Karlik was quite close during her life. Throughout her life she would meet with Meitner who worked with the team responsible for discovering [[nuclear fission]].\n\n=== Research ===\nAfter studying in Paris and London she started working at the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna|Institut f\u00fcr Radiumforschung]] (Institut for Radium Research) in Vienna in 1931. From 1937 she was allowed to give lectures, and slowly advanced in the hierarchy of the institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lise.univie.ac.at/physikerinnen/historisch/berta-karlik.htm|title=Physikerin - Berta Karlik|website=lise.univie.ac.at}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously Karlik joined a group on seawater research headed by the Swedish physicist Hans Pettersson. Mixing knowledge of oceanography and radioactivity, Karlik helped to bring up concerns about the biological issue of uranium contamination of seawater.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the Second World War she made her most important discovery, that the element with the atomic number 85, Astatine, was a product of natural decay. Astatine's main use is in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells. Due to this discovery Karlik was awarded the [[Haitinger Prize]] for Chemistry from the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1947.\n\nShe became provisional director of the institute in 1945 and official in 1947 upon discovering the existence of astatine. Berta Karlik was the first woman to be full professor (\"ordentliche Professur\") at the University of Vienna in 1956. She retired in 1973, but worked at the institute till her death in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w-fforte.at/de/wissenschafft-leben/pionierinnen/berta-karlik.html|title=w-fFORTE: Berta Karlik|last=w-fFORTE|website=www.w-fforte.at}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications ===\n* \"An Alpha-Radiation Ascribed to Element 85,\" S.B.Akad.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on'' ''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilized to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

He eats almost anything, including normally inedible objects. However, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies. [[Chocolate chip cookie]]s are his favorite kind.

Me real name Sid Monster.}}</ref> Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and [[eggplant]].\n\nHe is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who ironically does not like cookies). All three share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and \"[[googly eyes]].\" He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\nHe loves Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTwo years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' \u2014 and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was \"given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie.\" He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L. Frank Baum, Author Of 'Wizard Of Oz'|publisher=NPR}}</ref>\n\nCookie Monster, still unnamed, made his ''Sesame Street'' debut in the first episode, interfering with [[Kermit the Frog]]'s \"famous W lecture\" by eating a model \"W\" bit by bit. He turns it into an \"N,\" a \"V,\" and finally an \"I,\" to Kermit's frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt was during the first season that Cookie Monster got his name and began using the growly vernacular (e.g., \"Me eat cookie!\") that would become part of his character. His signature song, \"[[C Is For Cookie]]\", was first aired during the 1971\u201372 season, and became one of the best-known songs from ''Sesame Street''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Development==\nIn 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States, ''Sesame Street'' began airing segments titled [[Healthy Habits for Life]]. In these segments, the Muppet characters of ''Sesame Street'' talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The ''Healthy Habits for Life'' segments spawned Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely.<ref name=\"npr\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18659731 |title=Cookie Monster: A Sweet, Sensual Id, Unfiltered |first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=2008-02-11 |work=[[All Things Considered]]: In Character |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-07-cookie-monster_x.htm |title=Cookie Monster: 'Me eat less cookies' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2005-04-07 |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 appearance on [[Martha Stewart]]'s TV program, Cookie Monster explained his new philosophy that \"Cookies are a sometimes food.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=November 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/11/20/why-is-cookie-monster-eating-carrots/ |title=Why is Cookie Monster eating carrots? |first=Mike |last=Adamick |work=[[SF Gate]] (blog)}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2008, [[NPR]] host Elizabeth Blair interviewed Cookie Monster for the ''[[All Things Considered]]'' segment ''In Character''.

Colbert criticized Cookie Monster for not wearing a cookie [[lapel pin]]. Cookie Monster also claimed to have \"crazy times during the '70s and '80s,\" referring to himself as \"the [[Robert Downey Jr.#Substance abuse|Robert Downey Jr.]] of cookies.\" After eating a cookie to prove he still likes cookies, Cookie Monster asked if the Peabody Award, a round medallion on a small pedestal, was a cookie.<ref name=\"Colbert interview\">{{cite interview|subject=Cookie Monster|interviewer=[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]|title=Cookie Monster|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/zcd35g/the-colbert-report-cookie-monster|type=Interview: video|work=[[The Colbert Report]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> When Colbert returned to speak to Cookie Monster at the end of the show, the award had disappeared and Cookie Monster was wiping his mouth with a napkin.<ref name=\"Colbert interview\" />\n\nOn November 24, 2010, Cookie Monster started a Facebook page as part of a campaign to host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/24/cookie-monster-auditions-for-snl-hosting-gig/ | work=CNN | title=Cookie Monster auditions to be 'SNL' host &ndash; The Marquee Blog | date=2010-11-24}}</ref> Though his bid to host ''Saturday Night Live'' failed, he was allowed to appear with [[Jeff Bridges]] when Jeff hosted the show and sang the Christmas song \"[[Silver Bells]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-clip-jeff-bridges-dueting-61580 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='SNL' Clip of Jeff Bridges Dueting With Cookie Monster Becomes Viral Video Hit | date=2010-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Casting history==\n'''Main performers'''\n*[[Frank Oz]] \u2013 From 1969 to 2001; occasionally until 2004\n*[[David Rudman]] \u2013 From 2001 to present\n\nDavid Rudman officially became Cookie Monster in ''Sesame Street's'' 2002 season (taped 2001).

He eats almost anything, including normally inedible objects. However, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies. [[Chocolate chip cookie]]s are his favorite kind.

Me real name Sid Monster.}}</ref> Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and [[eggplant]].\n\nHe is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who ironically does not like cookies). All three share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and \"[[googly eyes]].\" He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTwo years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' \u2014 and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was \"given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie.\" He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L. Frank Baum, Author Of 'Wizard Of Oz'|publisher=NPR}}</ref>\n\nCookie Monster, still unnamed, made his ''Sesame Street'' debut in the first episode, interfering with [[Kermit the Frog]]'s \"famous W lecture\" by eating a model \"W\" bit by bit. He turns it into an \"N,\" a \"V,\" and finally an \"I,\" to Kermit's frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt was during the first season that Cookie Monster got his name and began using the growly vernacular (e.g., \"Me eat cookie!\") that would become part of his character. His signature song, \"[[C Is For Cookie]]\", was first aired during the 1971\u201372 season, and became one of the best-known songs from ''Sesame Street''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Development==\nIn 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States, ''Sesame Street'' began airing segments titled [[Healthy Habits for Life]]. In these segments, the Muppet characters of ''Sesame Street'' talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The ''Healthy Habits for Life'' segments spawned Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely.<ref name=\"npr\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18659731 |title=Cookie Monster: A Sweet, Sensual Id, Unfiltered |first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=2008-02-11 |work=[[All Things Considered]]: In Character |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-07-cookie-monster_x.htm |title=Cookie Monster: 'Me eat less cookies' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2005-04-07 |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 appearance on [[Martha Stewart]]'s TV program, Cookie Monster explained his new philosophy that \"Cookies are a sometimes food.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=November 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/11/20/why-is-cookie-monster-eating-carrots/ |title=Why is Cookie Monster eating carrots? |first=Mike |last=Adamick |work=[[SF Gate]] (blog)}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2008, [[NPR]] host Elizabeth Blair interviewed Cookie Monster for the ''[[All Things Considered]]'' segment ''In Character''.

A [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]], Stapleton played 15 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), most notably for the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]].  He was the father of [[Mike Stapleton]], who had a lengthy career in the NHL as well.\n\n==Playing career==\n[[File:Patrick Stapleton, February 2012.jpeg|thumb|right|Pat Stapleton in Moscow at a meeting of participants of the [[1972 Summit Series]], February 24, 2012.]]\nStapleton played Junior B hockey with the [[Sarnia Legionnaires (1954\u20131970)|Sarnia Legionnaires]] before spending two seasons with the [[St. Catharines Teepees]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], winning the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1960. With the Legionnaires he won two Western Jr. 'B' championships and one Sutherland Cup as an all-Ontario champion. Although he was a defenceman, he led the Legionnaires in scoring during his second season.\n\nHis first full season was with the [[Sault Thunderbirds]] of the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959-1963)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]] in 1960\u201361. Stapleton had signed with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], but was claimed by the [[Boston Bruins]] in the intra-league draft in June 1961 and began his [[National Hockey League]] career with the Bruins in the 1961\u201362 season. The next year, he split his time between Bruins and their EPHL affiliate, the [[Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)|Kingston Frontenacs]]. Stapleton spent the next two years in the minor leagues, playing with the [[Portland Buckaroos]] of the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]]. He received the [[Hal Laycoe Cup]] as the WHL's top defenceman for the 1964\u201365 season.\n\nStapleton was briefly the property of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in June 1965 as part of a trade with the Bruins, but he was left unprotected in the intra-league draft and was claimed the next day by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. Wearing number 7, he played some games with the Hawks' [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey league]] affiliate, the [[St. Louis Braves]], in 1965\u201366, but they would be the final minor league games of his career. Stapleton remained in the NHL for eight seasons with the Black Hawks, and was named Second Team All-Star three times (1966, 1971, and 1972). Stapleton played with the Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup finals in 1971 and 1973.  His highest scoring season was 1969, where his 50 assists set a new NHL record for assists in a season by a defenceman (broken the next year by [[Bobby Orr]]).\n\nStapleton was a member of the Team Canada team at the [[Summit Series]] in 1972. During the tournament he was a +6 and was often paired with his Black Hawks teammate Bill White. It is believed that Stapleton is the owner of the puck used by [[Paul Henderson]] to score the series-winning goal. Stapleton himself admits that he doesn't know which one of the hundreds of pucks he owns is that game winning one, though it is in his possession.<ref>[http://www.1972summitseries.com/stapleton.html 1972summitseries.com], accessed February 2, 2007</ref> [https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/canadian-teammate-finally-admits-he-has-the-puck-paul-henderson-scored-with-to-win-summit-series-or-does-he]\n\nIn 1973, Stapleton jumped from the NHL and signed a five-year deal with the  [[Chicago Cougars]] of the [[World Hockey Association]] where he became player-coach, replacing [[Marcel Pronovost]] as coach. He was a WHA first-team all-star in 1974 and won the [[Dennis A. Murphy Trophy]] as the league's top defenceman in the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nStapleton again represented Canada in the [[1974 Summit Series]] against the national team from the [[Soviet Union]], this time as team captain, recording three assists in eight games. He was again player-coach of the Cougars in 1974\u201375, and the team struggled on the ice and financially. In December 1974, he and teammates [[Dave Dryden]] and [[Ralph Backstrom]] bought the troubled franchise. At the time, Stapleton also owned two small arenas in the Chicago area along with other business interests.\n\nThe Cougars folded after the 1974\u201375 season and Stapleton was claimed by the [[Indianapolis Racers]], where he played for two seasons and was named a second-team all-star in 1976. When the Racers refused to honour his contract in 1977, Stapleton was transferred to the [[Cincinnati Stingers]], where he played one season before retiring in 1978. Over his career, Stapleton scored 337 points in the NHL and 239 in the WHA.\n\n==Retirement==\nStapleton lived in [[Strathroy-Caradoc|Strathroy]], [[Ontario]] and was a member of the advisory board of the Junior B [[Strathroy Rockets]] of the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League. He has a Strathroy and District Hockey Association award named after him.\n\nIn 2008, Stapleton brought the puck that Paul Henderson fired into the net to win the 1972 Summit Series with the Russians to a Sarnia Legionnaires game. He dropped it at a ceremonial faceoff being held to honour Legionnaire founder Tommy Norris. He told the Sarnia Observer that he had the puck on his stick when the buzzer sounded to end the series. He was about to shoot it down the ice when he suddenly paused and picked it up.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In May 2010, Stapleton told the [[Toronto Sun]] that he will hang onto the puck until the 40th Anniversary of the Summit Series in 2012.<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/joe_warmington/2010/05/29/14183661.html Holy puck!

He received the [[Hal Laycoe Cup]] as the WHL's top defenceman for the 1964\u201365 season.\n\nStapleton was briefly the property of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in June 1965 as part of a trade with the Bruins, but he was left unprotected in the intra-league draft and was claimed the next day by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. Wearing number 7, he played some games with the Hawks' [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey league]] affiliate, the [[St. Louis Braves]], in 1965\u201366, but they would be the final minor league games of his career. Stapleton remained in the NHL for eight seasons with the Black Hawks, and was named Second Team All-Star three times (1966, 1971, and 1972). Stapleton played with the Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup finals in 1971 and 1973.  His highest scoring season was 1969, where his 50 assists set a new NHL record for assists in a season by a defenceman (broken the next year by [[Bobby Orr]]).\n\nStapleton was a member of the Team Canada team at the [[Summit Series]] in 1972. During the tournament he was a +6 and was often paired with his Black Hawks teammate Bill White. It is believed that Stapleton is the owner of the puck used by [[Paul Henderson]] to score the series-winning goal. Stapleton himself admits that he doesn't know which one of the hundreds of pucks he owns is that game winning one, though it is in his possession.<ref>[http://www.1972summitseries.com/stapleton.html 1972summitseries.com], accessed February 2, 2007</ref> [https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/canadian-teammate-finally-admits-he-has-the-puck-paul-henderson-scored-with-to-win-summit-series-or-does-he]\n\nIn 1973, Stapleton jumped from the NHL and signed a five-year deal with the  [[Chicago Cougars]] of the [[World Hockey Association]] where he became player-coach, replacing [[Marcel Pronovost]] as coach. He was a WHA first-team all-star in 1974 and won the [[Dennis A. Murphy Trophy]] as the league's top defenceman in the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nStapleton again represented Canada in the [[1974 Summit Series]] against the national team from the [[Soviet Union]], this time as team captain, recording three assists in eight games. He was again player-coach of the Cougars in 1974\u201375, and the team struggled on the ice and financially. In December 1974, he and teammates [[Dave Dryden]] and [[Ralph Backstrom]] bought the troubled franchise. At the time, Stapleton also owned two small arenas in the Chicago area along with other business interests.\n\nThe Cougars folded after the 1974\u201375 season and Stapleton was claimed by the [[Indianapolis Racers]], where he played for two seasons and was named a second-team all-star in 1976. When the Racers refused to honour his contract in 1977, Stapleton was transferred to the [[Cincinnati Stingers]], where he played one season before retiring in 1978. Over his career, Stapleton scored 337 points in the NHL and 239 in the WHA.\n\n==Retirement==\nStapleton lived in [[Strathroy-Caradoc|Strathroy]], [[Ontario]] and was a member of the advisory board of the Junior B [[Strathroy Rockets]] of the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League. He has a Strathroy and District Hockey Association award named after him.\n\nIn 2008, Stapleton brought the puck that Paul Henderson fired into the net to win the 1972 Summit Series with the Russians to a Sarnia Legionnaires game. He dropped it at a ceremonial faceoff being held to honour Legionnaire founder Tommy Norris. He told the Sarnia Observer that he had the puck on his stick when the buzzer sounded to end the series. He was about to shoot it down the ice when he suddenly paused and picked it up.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In May 2010, Stapleton told the [[Toronto Sun]] that he will hang onto the puck until the 40th Anniversary of the Summit Series in 2012.<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/joe_warmington/2010/05/29/14183661.html Holy puck!

In the early 1980s Easley operated \"Easley Recording\" out of a hand-built garage studio behind his home near [[University of Memphis]]. During this period, bands such as [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]] came in to record; [[Alex Chilton]] produced an album for a [[Detroit]] group called The Gories the last year the studio was located in Easley's garage.\n\nBy 1990, Easley, with new partner Davis McCain, had found a larger midtown Memphis facility for the studio and moved into it by the next year. McCain had been the sound man at a 1980s local alternative music nightspot called The Antenna Club. The new Easley studio site was originally built in 1967 as \"the Onyx\" for Don Crews, who had been a business partner at [[American Sound Studios]] with producer [[Chips Moman]]. Crews parted from Moman at that time to start his own studio at the Onyx location.\n\nEasley McCain Recording's business began to pick up more clients from outside Memphis in the early 1990s, after a local group called the [[Grifters (band)|Grifters]] grew in popularity and advertised the studio's phone number in their liner notes. Indie rock bands from around the country including [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Come (US band)|Come]] began recording there. By 2001 the [[White Stripes]] had become a client, which led in turn to a [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]-produced album by [[Loretta Lynn]] to be mixed there.\n\nOthers recording at this indie-oriented studio have included [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Pezz]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], [[Guided by Voices]], [[Lydia Lunch]], dahrius, [[Box Tops]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[Wilco]], [[Cat Power]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Kim Deal]] with her band [[The Amps]], The Bamboozlers (precursors to [[Ingram Hill]]), [[Custard (band)|Custard]], [[Grifters (band)]], and many more.\n\nOn March 2, 2005, the studio's lobby and control room sustained serious damage in a fire.<ref> https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/fire-at-easley-mccain-studio/Content?oid=1121357 </ref>\n\nIn 2009, after four years of inactivity, Easley McCain Recording reopened at a brand new location in Memphis, TN.

In the early 1980s Easley operated \"Easley Recording\" out of a hand-built garage studio behind his home near [[University of Memphis]]. During this period, bands such as [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]] came in to record; [[Alex Chilton]] produced an album for a [[Detroit]] group called The Gories the last year the studio was located in Easley's garage.\n\nBy 1990, Easley, with new partner Davis McCain, had found a larger midtown Memphis facility for the studio and moved into it by the next year. McCain had been the sound man at a 1980s local alternative music nightspot called The Antenna Club. The new Easley studio site was originally built in 1967 as \"the Onyx\" for Don Crews, who had been a business partner at [[American Sound Studios]] with producer [[Chips Moman]]. Crews parted from Moman at that time to start his own studio at the Onyx location.\n\nEasley McCain Recording's business began to pick up more clients from outside Memphis in the early 1990s, after a local group called the [[Grifters (band)|Grifters]] grew in popularity and advertised the studio's phone number in their liner notes. Indie rock bands from around the country including [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Come (US band)|Come]] began recording there. By 2001 the [[White Stripes]] had become a client, which led in turn to a [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]-produced album by [[Loretta Lynn]] to be mixed there.\n\nOthers recording at this indie-oriented studio have included [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Pezz]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], [[Guided by Voices]], [[Lydia Lunch]], dahrius, [[Box Tops]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[Wilco]], [[Cat Power]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Kim Deal]] with her band [[The Amps]], The Bamboozlers (precursors to [[Ingram Hill]]), [[Custard (band)|Custard]], [[Grifters (band)]], and many more.\n\nOn March 2, 2005, the studio's lobby and control room sustained serious damage in a fire.<ref> https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/fire-at-easley-mccain-studio/Content?oid=1121357 </ref>\n\nIn 2009, after four years of inactivity, Easley McCain Recording reopened at a brand new location in Memphis, TN.
