The [[1941 October Revolution Parade|parade in 1941]] is particularly revered as it took place during the [[Battle of Moscow]], during which many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in action. In 1953, the parade took place as the first one to not be inspected by officers on horseback.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-nov7.htm</ref> The practice of foreign leaders began in 1957 with [[Mao Zedong]] attending that year's parade as part of a [[state visit]], continuing throughout the next two decades with Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s attendance in 1980 and the leaders of [[Warsaw Pact]] and USSR-allied nations in 1967, 1977 and 1987. The [[1989 October Revolution Parade|1989 parade]] was the first to have a drill routine by the massed bands take place. During the [[1990 October Revolution Parade|final parade]] in 1990, an assassination attempt was made on the life of President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], attempt to kill President by Alexander Shmonov, a locksmith from [[Leningrad]]. The two bullets he fired missed as he was tackled to the ground by crowds of demonstrators.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/politics/2017/02/16/the-last-soviet-terrorist-the-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-gorbachev_703611|title=The last Soviet terrorist: The man who tried to assassinate Gorbachev|last=Levkovich|first=Yevgeny|date=2017-02-16|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}</ref> The only time that a Soviet leader never attended a parade was in 1983 when [[Yuri Andropov]] did not attend the parade due to a sickness and his associate [[Konstantin Chernenko]] stood in for him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/08/world/andropov-misses-moscow-parade-stirring-rumors.html|title=ANDROPOV MISSES MOSCOW PARADE, STIRRING RUMORS|last=Times|first=Serge Schmemann, Special To The New York|date=1983-11-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n====Descriptor====\nThe most important event of the holiday is the national military parade and demonstrations on Moscow's Red Square, with members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] acting as the guests of honor. The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival honors for the commander of the parade, who is greeted by the commandant of the Frunze Military Academy (now the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]]), and receives the report on the parade's status. Once the parade commander (who is usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Moscow Military District) receives the report, he takes his position in the parade and orders the formations to stand at ease. A couple minutes later, a Communist Party and government delegation arrives at the grandstand on top of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]. The dignitaries include the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]], the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], members of the entire [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], including members from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and Secretariat, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service branch commanders, deputy defence ministers, members of the cabinet and commanders of the support departments in the general staff, in addition to the occasional foreign head of state or party as the principal foreign guest and reviewing officer. In between the south of the grandstand is a platoon of the armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment|Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in military overcoats whose purpose is to take post to mark the distance of the troops marching past. Seated in the stands on the west and east sides were residents of the capital, visitors from all over the Union, the diplomatic corps and military attaches and guests from allied and friendly countries with ties to the Union government. Within Red Square the more than 9,000 strong parade formation (11,000 during jubilee years) was complemented by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, conducted by the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces, the billet of an officer who usually held major general rank, at the start of the parade the bands were split into four sections across the expanse of the Square in between the inspecting formations. The mobile column, also present, was made up of around 170-380 vehicles and around 3,900 crews drawn from the participant units making up the segment of the parade.\n\n==== Parade proper ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The Leningrad parade in 1983.]]\nAs the [[Kremlin]]'s [[Spasskaya Tower]] sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms and look to the left for inspection. The Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) then is driven on a limousine to the center of the square to receive the parade report from the commander, with the combined bands playing ''Jubillee March of the Red Army'' in the background. Once the report is received, the Minister and the parade commander begin to inspect the parading formations together with the bands. The limousinesed stop at each formation in order for the minister to send his greeting to the contingents, in which they respond with a threefold \"Ura\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430). Other than the Red Square inspection, the commander and the minister would also inspect the personnel of the mobile column on Manezhnaya Square. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands played ''[[Long Live our State]]'' by [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov]] as the commander returns to his place in the parade, and the Minister driven to the grandstand while the entire parade shouts 'Ura!' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430!) repeatedly until he takes his position in the grandstand and the bands end playing (from 1945 to 1966 ''[[Slavsya]]'' from ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' took its place and yet again in 1990). During this time, the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], which is an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's limousine. The parade is then ordered to stand at ease and the chromatic fanfare trumpeters, together with the rest of the musicians of the massed bands, sound a fanfare call, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare'' for the keynote address by the minister which will follow. As the minister concludes his address, he will yell \"Ura!\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \"\u0423\u0440\u0430!\") to which the entire parade repeats thrice. The Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison then play the full version of the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] while a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound a second fanfare and the parade commander orders the parade to do carry out the following commands for the march past:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''<br>''Eyes to the right...''<br>''Quick march!''\n\nOn the command \"Quick march!\", the linemen take their places at the south end of the square while the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College march to a drum tune, while the fifers and trumpeters play a specific tune, in a tradition that would go on until the late 1990s and early 2000s when the trumpets were removed. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums begin to swing their drumsticks while on the eyes right led by the drum major. The Corps is immediately followed by the officers of the Frunze Military Academy whereas on jubilee parades, the massed colour guard is the first formation other than the corps on the square, followed by a historical contingent. The troops have always marched in the following order during the parade:\n\n===== Order of ground march past column =====\n\n'''Military Bands'''\n* Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service\n* Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College\n\n'''Ground Column'''\n* Parade commander holding the appointment of commanding officer of the [[Moscow Military District]]\n* Color Guard Unit (in jubilee parades)\n* Historical contingent (in jubilee parades)\n** Red Guards\n** Ex-Imperial Russian Army servicemen within the Red Army\n** Sailors of the Aurora\n** Red Army soldiers during the Civil War\n** Great Patriotic War contingent\n* [[Frunze Military Academy]]\n* V.I.

When the ground segment ends, the bands perform an about turn and march towards the facade of the GUM department store to give way to the mobile column, which drives past as the bands play ''Victorious March'' and ''Moscow Salute''. Once the ground mobile column is complete, the bands take their position at the western end of the square to prepare for the finale, led by the senior director of music, conductors, bandmasters and drum majors. The finale involves the massed bands marching down the square to the tune of ''[[Song of the Soviet Army]]'' or ''Metropolitan March'' and as the bands march past the grandstand, the senior director of music, conductors and bandmasters salute at the eyes right. In 1967, the massed bands marched out to the tune of ''My Beloved Motherland''.\n\n===== Order of mobile column drivepast =====\n* 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division\n* 98th Guards Airborne Division\n* 4th Guards Tank Division\n* Moscow Military District Field Artillery and Rocket Forces\n* Moscow Military District Ground Forces Air Defense\n* 1st Moscow Air and Air Defense Forces Army\n* [[Northern Fleet]] and [[Baltic Fleet]] Coastal Defense, Surface and Submarine Forces (until 1974)\n* Strategic Missile Forces [[27th Guards Rocket Army]]\n\nSimilar parade events were held in all major cities in the [[RSFSR]] as well as in the [[USSR]], with the first secretary of the local communist party branch being the guest of honor and the commander of the regional military district or large formation acting as the parade inspector and keynote speaker, while the second-in command of the unit or command served as parade commander. The parade format is the same in these cities, with particularities beiing shaped to fit the specific parade ground (e.g. [[October Square, Minsk]]). Massed bands for the parade were drawn from the formation or district bands located in their respective areas. The Government of the [[Armenian SSR]] cancelled the 1989 parade in [[Yerevan]] due to extended protests, while the mobile column of the parade in the Moldovan capital of [[Kishinev]] was removed from the itinerary due to protester blocking the streets and preventing passage to vehicles.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/11/07/Soviet-Revolution-Day-celebrations-disrupted/1102626418000/|title=Soviet Revolution Day celebrations disrupted|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en|newspaper=UPI}}</ref> A similar occurred event occurred on what is now [[Gediminas Avenue]] in Vilnius.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=LordBenas|title=1989 sovietinis paradas Gedimino prospektu.|date=2008-05-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arDpzcWhxlg|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Civil parade and workers' demonstration ====\n[[File:Moscow 1977-11-07-15.jpg|thumb|Workers demonstration]]\nThe bands having marched off the square is the signal for the commencement of the holiday civil parade and workers' demonstration in Red Square. In jubilee years (more frequency in the parades of the 1960s and 1970s), the civil parade kicks off with a spectacular march made up of the following components preceding the workers' demonstration march:\n\n* Red flag bearers\n* Historical segment (present in the parades of 1967 and 1987)\n* Officials, management, staff and employees of the Moscow City CPSU Committee and Moscow City Council\n* Representatives of state economic enterprises and firms in Moscow\n* [[Komsomol]]\n* [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization]]\n* [[DOSAAF]]\n* Color Guard, Athletes and Coaches from the [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union]]\n* Moscow National Central Physical Fitness and Sports School\n\n[[File:70th Anniversary Emblem.png|thumb|The logo of the 1987 celebrations.]]\n\nFloat displays also featured prominently in the civil parades where floats were designed to promote government and party campaigns or highlight the works of various public companies, farm collectives and state economic firms. At a certain point during the civil parade, Pioneers in winter jackets and carrying flowers representing schools in Moscow and all over the country run towards the front of the Mausoleum facade and are split into two groups that ascend the staircases towards the dignitaries in the grandstand to give them flower bouquets. Following the civil parade the workers' demonstration officially begins, wherein workers from state economic and social firms in Moscow, as well as from schools and universities, march past as part of their respective community delegations. Each delegation has a color guard unit and brass band taking part, as well as floats from the participating state enterprises. Each of Moscow's districts march past the grandstand to greet everyone a Happy Revolution Day, especially to the dignitaries and everyone in the stands watching as balloons fly out from the crowds filing past while recorded music is played on the speakers. After an hour or two, the civil parade ends with a huge crowd bidding the principal dignitaries farewell from the grounds of the square with red flags in their hands as one final cheer resounds from the sound systems installed along the entire length of the square.\n\nSimilar civil parades occurred in all major cities and the republican capital cities following the military parades.\n\n==Post-Soviet observance==\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 7 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 13 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|CPRF celebrations in 2009.]]\nIn Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times.

The [[1941 October Revolution Parade|parade in 1941]] is particularly revered as it took place during the [[Battle of Moscow]], during which many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in action. In 1953, the parade took place as the first one to not be inspected by officers on horseback.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-nov7.htm</ref> The practice of foreign leaders began in 1957 with [[Mao Zedong]] attending that year's parade as part of a [[state visit]], continuing throughout the next two decades with Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s attendance in 1980 and the leaders of [[Warsaw Pact]] and USSR-allied nations in 1967, 1977 and 1987. The [[1989 October Revolution Parade|1989 parade]] was the first to have a drill routine by the massed bands take place.

The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival honors for the commander of the parade, who is greeted by the commandant of the Frunze Military Academy (now the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]]), and receives the report on the parade's status. Once the parade commander (who is usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Moscow Military District) receives the report, he takes his position in the parade and orders the formations to stand at ease. A couple minutes later, a Communist Party and government delegation arrives at the grandstand on top of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]. The dignitaries include the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]], the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], members of the entire [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], including members from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and Secretariat, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service branch commanders, deputy defence ministers, members of the cabinet and commanders of the support departments in the general staff, in addition to the occasional foreign head of state or party as the principal foreign guest and reviewing officer. In between the south of the grandstand is a platoon of the armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment|Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in military overcoats whose purpose is to take post to mark the distance of the troops marching past. Seated in the stands on the west and east sides were residents of the capital, visitors from all over the Union, the diplomatic corps and military attaches and guests from allied and friendly countries with ties to the Union government. Within Red Square the more than 9,000 strong parade formation (11,000 during jubilee years) was complemented by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, conducted by the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces, the billet of an officer who usually held major general rank, at the start of the parade the bands were split into four sections across the expanse of the Square in between the inspecting formations. The mobile column, also present, was made up of around 170-380 vehicles and around 3,900 crews drawn from the participant units making up the segment of the parade.\n\n==== Parade proper ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The Leningrad parade in 1983.]]\nAs the [[Kremlin]]'s [[Spasskaya Tower]] sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms and look to the left for inspection. The Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) then is driven on a limousine to the center of the square to receive the parade report from the commander, with the combined bands playing ''Jubillee March of the Red Army'' in the background. Once the report is received, the Minister and the parade commander begin to inspect the parading formations together with the bands. The limousinesed stop at each formation in order for the minister to send his greeting to the contingents, in which they respond with a threefold \"Ura\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430). Other than the Red Square inspection, the commander and the minister would also inspect the personnel of the mobile column on Manezhnaya Square. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands played ''[[Long Live our State]]'' by [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov]] as the commander returns to his place in the parade, and the Minister driven to the grandstand while the entire parade shouts 'Ura!' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430!) repeatedly until he takes his position in the grandstand and the bands end playing (from 1945 to 1966 ''[[Slavsya]]'' from ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' took its place and yet again in 1990). During this time, the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], which is an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's limousine. The parade is then ordered to stand at ease and the chromatic fanfare trumpeters, together with the rest of the musicians of the massed bands, sound a fanfare call, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare'' for the keynote address by the minister which will follow. As the minister concludes his address, he will yell \"Ura!\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \"\u0423\u0440\u0430!\") to which the entire parade repeats thrice. The Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison then play the full version of the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] while a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound a second fanfare and the parade commander orders the parade to do carry out the following commands for the march past:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''<br>''Eyes to the right...''<br>''Quick march!''\n\nOn the command \"Quick march!\", the linemen take their places at the south end of the square while the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College march to a drum tune, while the fifers and trumpeters play a specific tune, in a tradition that would go on until the late 1990s and early 2000s when the trumpets were removed. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums begin to swing their drumsticks while on the eyes right led by the drum major. The Corps is immediately followed by the officers of the Frunze Military Academy whereas on jubilee parades, the massed colour guard is the first formation other than the corps on the square, followed by a historical contingent. The troops have always marched in the following order during the parade:\n\n===== Order of ground march past column =====\n\n'''Military Bands'''\n* Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service\n* Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College\n\n'''Ground Column'''\n* Parade commander holding the appointment of commanding officer of the [[Moscow Military District]]\n* Color Guard Unit (in jubilee parades)\n* Historical contingent (in jubilee parades)\n** Red Guards\n** Ex-Imperial Russian Army servicemen within the Red Army\n** Sailors of the Aurora\n** Red Army soldiers during the Civil War\n** Great Patriotic War contingent\n* [[Frunze Military Academy]]\n* V.I.

When the ground segment ends, the bands perform an about turn and march towards the facade of the GUM department store to give way to the mobile column, which drives past as the bands play ''Victorious March'' and ''Moscow Salute''. Once the ground mobile column is complete, the bands take their position at the western end of the square to prepare for the finale, led by the senior director of music, conductors, bandmasters and drum majors. The finale involves the massed bands marching down the square to the tune of ''[[Song of the Soviet Army]]'' or ''Metropolitan March'' and as the bands march past the grandstand, the senior director of music, conductors and bandmasters salute at the eyes right. In 1967, the massed bands marched out to the tune of ''My Beloved Motherland''.\n\n===== Order of mobile column drivepast =====\n* 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division\n* 98th Guards Airborne Division\n* 4th Guards Tank Division\n* Moscow Military District Field Artillery and Rocket Forces\n* Moscow Military District Ground Forces Air Defense\n* 1st Moscow Air and Air Defense Forces Army\n* [[Northern Fleet]] and [[Baltic Fleet]] Coastal Defense, Surface and Submarine Forces (until 1974)\n* Strategic Missile Forces [[27th Guards Rocket Army]]\n\nSimilar parade events were held in all major cities in the [[RSFSR]] as well as in the [[USSR]], with the first secretary of the local communist party branch being the guest of honor and the commander of the regional military district or large formation acting as the parade inspector and keynote speaker, while the second-in command of the unit or command served as parade commander. The parade format is the same in these cities, with particularities beiing shaped to fit the specific parade ground (e.g. [[October Square, Minsk]]). Massed bands for the parade were drawn from the formation or district bands located in their respective areas. The Government of the [[Armenian SSR]] cancelled the 1989 parade in [[Yerevan]] due to extended protests, while the mobile column of the parade in the Moldovan capital of [[Kishinev]] was removed from the itinerary due to protester blcoking the streets and preventing passage to vehicles.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/11/07/Soviet-Revolution-Day-celebrations-disrupted/1102626418000/|title=Soviet Revolution Day celebrations disrupted|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en|newspaper=UPI}}</ref> A similar occurred event occurred on what is now [[Gediminas Avenue]] in Vilnius.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=LordBenas|title=1989 sovietinis paradas Gedimino prospektu.|date=2008-05-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arDpzcWhxlg|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Civil parade and workers' demonstration ====\n[[File:Moscow 1977-11-07-15.jpg|thumb|Workers demonstration]]\nThe bands having marched off the square is the signal for the commencement of the holiday civil parade and workers' demonstration in Red Square.

At a certain point during the civil parade, Pioneers in winter jackets and carrying flowers representing schools in Moscow and all over the country run towards the front of the Mausoleum facade and are split into two groups that ascend the staircases towards the dignitaries in the grandstand to give them flower bouquets. Following the civil parade the workers' demonstration officially begins, wherein workers from state economic and social firms in Moscow, as well as from schools and universities, march past as part of their respective community delegations. Each delegation has a color guard unit and brass band taking part, as well as floats from the participating state enterprises. Each of Moscow's districts march past the grandstand to greet everyone a Happy Revolution Day, especially to the dignitaries and everyone in the stands watching as balloons fly out from the crowds filing past while recorded music is played on the speakers. After an hour or two, the civil parade ends with a huge crowd bidding the principal dignitaries farewell from the grounds of the square with red flags in their hands as one final cheer resounds from the sound systems installed along the entire length of the square.\n\nSimilar civil parades occurred in all major cities and the republican capital cities following the military parades.\n\n==Post-Soviet observance==\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 7 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 13 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|CPRF celebrations in 2009.]]\nIn Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times.

It was released in early July 2004.<ref name=\"icv2\"/> There was also an online computer game based on Pirates of the Spanish Main by Sony Online Entertainment called [[Pirates CSG Online]], which ended on 1/31/2011.\n\nThe game won the [[Origins Award|Origins]] Vanguard Award 2005.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, collectible maker [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] announced the purchase of the Wizkids name and properties from Topps, specifically including the ''Pirates'' line, which was canceled.\n\nOn March 9, 2012, Wizkids announced that they plan to release a card-only version of the game, called \"Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck.\"<ref>http://wizkidsgames.com/blog/2012/03/09/necawizkids-announces-the-re-launch-of-the-pirates-of-the-spanish-main-property/</ref> Other games have since followed in their \"Shuffling the Deck\" line of card games.\n\n== Description ==\nThe general goal of Pirates is to collect more gold than your opponents,<ref name=\"icv2\"/> or with variants, to achieve a given objective or destroy all enemy ships (numerous scenarios written by WizKids and others have vastly extended the playability of the game). The game's pieces include ships, forts, sea monsters, crew, islands and other terrain markers, events, gold and other treasure tokens.\n\nAn innovative feature of Pirates is the 'constructible' element of the game; each game piece (except for terrain) is created by popping out the small [[polystyrene]] pieces from placeholder cards and assembling them. As the ship, fort or sea monster is damaged by enemies during the course of game play, pieces of it are removed to record how much damage it has sustained, giving the game piece itself the appearance of slowly being destroyed. The elements removed from the piece - for example, a ship's masts - can no longer be used in the game unless another game element allows it to be replaced later.\n\nEach game piece has a point value that is related to its overall power. The more powerful a piece, the higher its point value. Players assemble fleets of ships, monsters, forts, and crew based an agreed-upon point total, similar to the manner in which many miniature war games are played. This helps balance each player's fleet, and means that the construction of a fleet can be as strategically important as the gameplay itself.\n\nThe action takes place on a tabletop or similar flat surface rather than a game board; before play begins, players take turns populating the play area with various pieces of terrain like islands, fog banks, and sargasso seas. Face-down gold or treasure tokens are then placed on each island. After creating the play area, players then place their fleets and gameplay begins.\n\nPlayers take turns moving their ships around the play area, landing on islands and exploring them, which reveals the value of the gold and treasure tokens on that island. Ships then collect treasure and attempt to return it to their home islands before their opponents. Since the game's [[Game mechanic#Victory condition mechanics|victory condition]]s include both gold collection and the destruction of all enemy fleets, there are several different strategies that can lead to victory: trying to destroy an opponent before he or she can gather gold; building a fast and strong enough fleet to avoid being destroyed; or, most common, a mix of both.\n\nThe game is packaged so that one person may play the game with only one game pack, but several more packs are required to play using the full rules. Additionally, the game is far more enjoyable and balanced when each player has a larger selection of game pieces from which to choose when assembling their fleets.\n\nThe recommended \"sweet spot\" for playability appears to be three to five players on a 90&nbsp;cm by 90&nbsp;cm (3 foot by 3 foot) 'ocean'.\n\n==Configurations==\nThe game is primarily sold in \"game packs\", foil-wrapped packs of randomized styrene cards and other game components roughly the same size as a pack of [[baseball cards]] or other [[trading card game]] packs such as [[Magic: The Gathering]]. Each pack includes a randomized combination of two constructible game pieces: ships (including forts and sea monsters), and various crew, treasure and terrain. These game pieces are numbered and collectible, and come in multiple levels of rarity designated by a color-coded triangle on each card's corner - the most common rarities for standard booster pack items are : Common (white for generic crew, red for ships), Uncommon (silver-grey), Rare (yellow), or Super Rare (black). Other rarity designations for non-pack ships include \"Special Edition\" (green), a one-off Promo (purple), and \"Limited Edition\" (copper) for tournament prize ships.\n\nUnlike most trading card games, due to the limited number of game pieces in each pack, some packs do not contain any Rare or Super Rare game pieces, or may contain multiple Rares. Any given set's Super-Rares will always come all together in the same pack. Each pack also contains a cardboard island (the reverse side in later sets has printed terrain such as a fog bank, sargasso sea, or reef), a checklist and set of rules, a crew/treasure card (which may include gold pieces for use in the game), and a mini-die. Each pack generally costs $4 US.\n\nWizKids released other game configurations as well, mostly into mass market channels such as [[Toys \"R\" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Wal-Mart]]. These include but are not limited to:\n*'''Promotional pieces and packs''': Various ships since the game's inception have been sent to retailers to be given away, usually in a clear plastic wrappers. Some of these are Limited Edition items, and some are duplicates of items found in common booster packs.\n*'''Tins''': A small tin box decorated with Pirates artwork which contains multiple Pirates booster packs. With ''Ocean's Edge'', some Special Edition tin exclusive card packs were also included in the tins. Also released were \"Mega Tins\" - slightly larger tins containing ''Ocean's Edge'' booster packs, and a special plastic wrapped pack containing faction-specific junk ships and crew. Two of the factions were only available in Tins exclusive to specific US retailers, Wal-Mart and Target. Finally, ''Rise of the Fiends'' \"Treasure Chest Tins\" contained one of four Megacards.\n*'''Value Boxes''': A small cardboard box with a window in it, typically containing one of four possible Special Edition prebuilt ship, crew, standard gold treasure, islands, and occasionally a full-sized die. The prebuilt ships have a green corner rarity indicator which is referred to as \"Special Edition\". These have been released for a number of sets since ''Revolution''.\n*'''Megapacks''': A booster pack twice the size of normal packs, containing four ships or monsters, a megacard (double-sized card), one mini-die, and several terrain. Released so far only for ''Oceans' Edge''.\n\nOn October 25, 2006, WizKids released \"[[Pirates: Quest For Davy Jones' Gold]]\", a non-collectible [[board game]] version of the Pirates game that uses gameplay elements and game pieces from the constructible strategy game, but is designed to be simplified, self-contained and sold in the board game section of retail stores.\n\n== Factions ==\nShips, forts, sea monsters and crew are members of various [[Political faction|faction]]s. The factions exist largely for fictional purposes, but there are certain game mechanics that use the factions as well. \n* The [[Pirates]], representing the popular view of Pirates around the \"Golden Age of Piracy\". They are absent in '''Pirates of the Barbary Coast'''.\n* The [[England|English]], representing England and later the [[British Empire]].\n* The [[Spain|Spanish]], representing Spain and its empire in the [[new world]].\n* The [[France|French]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\", representing first the French empire and then the Napoleonic empire in later expansions.\n* The [[United States|Americans]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Revolution\", who represent the American colonies during and after the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n* The [[Barbary pirates|Barbary Corsairs]], who represent the pirates that operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during this time period. They only appear in \"Pirates of the Barbary Coast\".\n* The Jade Rebellion, a fictional group representing a confederation of 'Asian' pirate-revolutionaries in the [[South China Sea]]. They only appear in \"Pirates of the South China Seas\", with the exception of a super-rare \"intro\" pack from PotBC.\n* The Cursed, a label encompassing various evil supernatural characters, ships and sea monsters.\n* The [[Mercenaries]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\" are a collection of [[steampunk]]-like scientists, revolutionaries and ships, including submarines.\n* The [[Vikings]] introduced in \"Pirates of the Frozen North\" are not historical Vikings, but [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors who use Viking [[mythology]], symbols and names for their ships.\n\n== Releases ==\n\n===Pirates of the Spanish Main===\n\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\" was the first release, and hit stores on July 28, 2004. It quickly sold out in many places, resulting in a second \"limited\" print run which featured noticeably higher quality printing than the first print run (the first run cards appear extremely 'faded'). This set was printed in a number of languages: English, German, French and Spanish. The only other sets printed in a foreign language (German) were \"Crimson Coast\", \"Revolution\", \"Davy Jones' Curse\", \"Mysterious Islands\", and \"Ocean's Edge\".\n\nThe set introduced the Pirate, English, and Spanish factions, with ships for each faction ranging in size from one to five masts. Twelve named crew members, along with the generic crew of [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]], [[Helmsman]], [[Musketeer]], [[Shipwright]], [[Oarsman]], [[Cannoneer]], and [[exploration|Explorer]] were also present for each faction. A number of generic treasure, in the form of gold pieces ranging in value from 1 to 7, as well as nine pieces of named unique treasure were included, along with an assortment of cardboard islands with blank backs.\n\nAt the 2004 [[Origins Award]]s ''Pirates of the Spanish Main'' was one of the winners of the ''Vanguard Awards''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2004/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (2004) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603142308/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2004/list-of-winners |archivedate=June 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Pirates of the Crimson Coast===\n{{main|Pirates of the Crimson Coast}}\nThe first expansion was released on March 2, 2005, and added the French faction, as well as the unit type of [[Fort]]s, which were placed on islands to defend them. It expanded the rules with the Ghost Ship and Schooner ship types; the Broadsides Attack, Limit, and Ransom keywords; and two new generic crew types, the Stinkpot and [[Chainshot]] Specialists. Fog Banks, Reefs, and [[Sargasso Sea]]s were added to the back of the islands as special terrain. The set also previewed the forthcoming American faction with the ship ''[[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]]''.\n\n===Pirates of the Spanish Main - Unlimited Edition===\nThis edition was released on March 15, 2005, as a second reprint of the cards from the original \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\". The numbering scheme on the cards was updated to conform with the \"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\" numbering and rarity colors. A checklist of the cards was also added. In Europe, the expansion removed the island cards and in their place issued new rules for ship movement and a playmat.\n\n===Pirates of the Revolution===\n{{main|Pirates of the Revolution}}\nReleased in June 2005, \"Revolution\" added the new American faction, and special Event cards (Divers, Raft, Mermaids, Foul Winds and Becalmed). In addition, the [[Marine (armed services)|Marine]] keyword and [[Galley]] ship type debuted, along with the new generic crew Firepot Specialist.\n\n===Pirates of the Barbary Coast===\n{{main|Pirates of the Barbary Coast}}\nReleased on October 26, 2005, this set added the [[Barbary Pirates|Barbary Corsair]] faction, and a new generic crew type, the Smokepot Specialist. Four super-rare cards (two ships and two crew) previewed the forthcoming [[Jade Rebellion]] faction. It is the only set to lack the Pirate faction.\n\n===Pirates of the South China Seas===\n{{main|Pirates of the South China Seas}}\nThis expansion was released on February 22, 2006, and added the Jade Rebellion's [[Junk (ship)|Junk]] and [[Turtle Ship]] types, as well as the Fear keyword and game mechanic. Six new Events (Hidden Cove, Favor of the Gods, Rolling Fog, False Treasure, Duel, Cursed Zone) were included, as well as the first six-masted ships. The super-rares for this set previewed the new Cursed faction (two ships and two unique treasures). WizKids offered a mail-in promotion for the first 10-master, a junk treasure ship called the [[Baochuan]] and her captain Admiral [[Zheng He]].\n\n====Notable ships====\n\n*Glorious Treasure - Jade Rebellion, 1-mast, 2 armor, 6 points.  This ship can deal up to 2 masts of damage and kill one crew when it rams an enemy ship making this ship worth far above 6 points.  The armor and its '''turtle ship''' ability enable it to take twice as many hits as a normal 1-mast ship. Its cannon is decent and the ship is of average speed.  This ship can even destroy a 3-mast ship with only minor damage unlike most 1-mast ships. It is very vulnerable to being hit with a firepot specialist.\n*Grand Path - Jade Rebellion, 6-mast, 17 points, with 6 2S cannons and a special ability to add +1 to boarding rolls.\n*Feathered Hat - Pirate, 4-mast, 12 points.  The Feathered Hat has average cannons (2S 3S 3S 3S) and good speed (S+L) but her ability is powerful\u2014the Feathered Hat can be crewed by any nationality.  Her 3 cargo preclude her from being very useful as a treasure runner but taking on three crew from any nation could make her downright lethal.\n*USS New Orleans - America, 2-mast, 12 points.  This ship can hide behind something and then pop out to steal a derelict ship.  Both of the ships become \"teleported\" to the home island removing both from danger.  In a large battle, this ship has a high value for recovery.\n*Santa Ana - Spain, 4-mast, 15 points. Santa Ana could be considered a weaker version of the powerful HMS Titan, as it can receive an extra action on a 5 or a 6. It has slightly above average cannons, sporting 2 rank 2 S range cannons, and 2 rank 3 L range cannons. Its 5 cargo allows it to become a powerful flagship.\n\n====Notable crew====\n\n*Pirate - The Headhunter (sacrifice a crew for extra action; +1 to cannon rolls vs. non-Pirates). The Headhunter was named by a winner of the world's first Pirates of the Spanish Main event and subsequent [[auction]] at [[Gen Con]] Indy 2004.\n*French - Princess Arii Auraa (0pts, crew cost 0 on this ship)\n*American - Commodore Matthew Perry (0LR, +5 fleet points)\n*Jade Rebellion\n**Zheng Li Kwan (sacrifice a crew for extra action; treasure switcher)\n**Ms. Cheng (0LR reroll 1 die per turn)\n**Dragon Eyes (10 points, may capture enemy crew for gold when boarding)\n**Li Quin (0LR +5 fleet points)\n**The Nameless (1+ to boarding rolls)\n\n===Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse===\n{{cleanup|reason=merged information overlengthy in comparison to rest of article|date=December 2014}}\n\"Davy Jones' Curse\" was released on May 31, 2006, featuring the new Cursed faction, and the [[Sea Monster]] unit type, which acted as ship but could not carry crew. A mail-in promotion offered a 10-masted Cursed ship, the ''Guichuan'', and her captain Headhunter.\n\n'''Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse''' is an expansion set for the [[constructible strategy game]] [[Pirates of the Spanish Main]] produced by [[WizKids]]. It expanded on [[The Cursed]] Faction and was released on May 31, 2006.\n\n'''Set details'''\n*The expansion includes cards for the following factions:\n** American\n** Cursed\n** Pirate\n** English\n** French\n** Spanish\n*The die color in this set is red (d6).\n*The set introduced [[Sea Monster]]s, The Cursed faction, and a new keyword - the Black Mark.\n*The Black Mark - This crew may start as if it belonged to the Cursed faction, play it face up if so. The ship that the crew is part of is now considered to belong to the Cursed Nation. If played face up in this way, the crew's point cost is increased by 1.\n*Four super rare cards ('''Mist Walker, Behemoth, Screaming Mimi and The Red Skull''') may be found in a single pack which is indistinguishable from a normal card pack. Super Rare packs appear approximately 1 in 100 packs. In a first for this game line, these cards are printed on a semi-translucent plastic stock, giving them a 'ghostly' appearance.\n*Value Box Sets: This is the first (and so far only) set to feature 'two runs' of Value Box sets, 8 altogether.  Each value box contains 6 ships and/or sea monsters, 3 crew and/or treasure, as well as 2 islands, and 1 full size (d6) die. Initially, four special edition ships were issued ('''Boneyard, Electric Eel, Drowned Man, and Fool's Gold'''). A further four \"special edition\" boxes with new ships ('''The Black Diamond, Broken Key, Nightmare and HMS Richard''') was released later, in October 2006.\n**Value Box Trivia: a packaging 'exploit' led to buyers being able to see into any value box without opening it, and because the Davey Jones Super Rares have a translucent appearance, tell if the Super Rare pack was a part of that particular Value Box or not before purchase. This was corrected in following sets by adding an opaque insert to block the view.\n* This set consists of 144 pieces in the base set, with an additional 18 Limited Edition Ships given as Tournament Prizes, and one convention exclusive ship for a grand total of 160 cards (Not including the different versions of islands). Game pieces are numbered 001-145, 200-217 and 300.\n* 18 Limited Edition, one & two masted ships are available as tournament prize LE's, which were distributed to the public in a new fashion for this set: one package of three different LE ships is included in each 36-count retail Booster Box (apparently with the idea that the game store will remove the package before selling the box or packs and give the LE ships to winning tournament players). In practice, many of these packs ended up thrown away or auctioned on eBay. Additional prize packages of these cards were apparently mailed later on to a few tournament Envoys as well, but this new distribution method for tournament prize cards led to these particular cards being much harder to collect, and they still command large prices when they appear at auction.\n* '''The Guichuan''' - a 10-masted ghost junk, was part of a special giveaway - twelve pack wrappers, receipt from the store the packs were purchased at, and a shipping and handling fee were required for the giveaway. It also included a crew called '''The Headhunter''' on the ship card.\n\n'''Sea Monsters'''\nThe concept of Sea Monsters was introduced in this set, with ten sea monster pieces (8 are rare, 2<sup>*</sup> are super rare): Leviathan, Calim, Calypsos, Mist Walker<sup>*</sup>, Behemoth<sup>*</sup>, Tiamat, Tsuro, Slarge Gubbit, Jormungandr, and Gog-Clocthoth.\n\nControllers decide whether the Monster is submerged (movement only), or surfaced (move or attack). Two of the monsters have breath weapons, Tiamat has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. Leviathan has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. The others have game-changing abilities such as moving in and out of fog banks (Mist Walker) - this ability is commonly called a 'fog hopper' - and eliminating masts or crew in boarding actions. Behemoth can copy another ability. Tsuro may move an opponents ship, (with proper dice roll).\n\nLater sets fiddled with keywords such as 'Kraken', 'Titan', 'Octopus', 'Sea Dragon' and others, but for this set, the keyword was simply \"Sea Monster\" regardless of the creature type.\n\n'''Notable ships'''\n*[[The Flying Dutchman]] - A famous ghost ship with five 2+ to hit cannons.\n*Harbinger - A ship captained by the pirate Jack Hawkins that can board other ships without having to ram them if the ship is in short distance away from her.\n*[[The Pequod]] - Famous ship from the novel [[Moby-Dick]].\n*El Raton - an error in printing shows this ship as a common (red color corner) card, it is actually a rare as shown on both the checklist and the WizKids card gallery.\n\n'''Notable crew'''\n*[[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] - The Cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones is a separate legend, but was linked by Wizkids to the Dutchman. (This was done to tie it in with the films, The Pirates of the Caribbean.) The Dutchman was either the name of the ship, or a nickname for her Captain. Depending on which myth you hear.\n*The Inquisitor - (Black Mark) A mysterious figure around which many Spanish ships are linked, he can remove all crew on a ship if a boarding action is won.\n\n===Pirates of the Mysterious Islands===\nReleased on November 15, 2006, \"Mysterious Islands\" added the new [[Mercenary]] faction, along with [[Jules Verne]] inspired [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]-style submarines. The titular \"Mysterious Islands\" were added as special islands with effects decided by dice rolls.\n\n===Pirates of the Frozen North===\n{{main|Pirates of the Frozen North}}\n\"Frozen North\", released on February 14, 2007, added the Norse [[Vikings]] faction and the [[Iceberg]] terrain type, as well as the [[Icebreaker]] and [[Longship]] ship types. Islands were numbered for the first time in this set. A mail-in promotion offered the \"Nordic Raiders Pack\" with the ''Serpent's Fang'' and ''Polaris'' ships and the ''Odin's Revenge'' unique treasure.\n\n===Pirates at Ocean's Edge===\n{{main|Pirates at Ocean's Edge}}\nReleased on April 18, 2007, \"Ocean's Edge\" added [[Whirlpools]] as a terrain type, Windcatchers and [[Catamaran]]s as new ship types, and [[Sea monster|Sea Dragons]] and Titans (giant crabs) as new monster types. A 10-masted ship called the ''Zeus'' and her captain Emperor Blackheart were available as a mail-in promotion.\n\n===Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels===\n{{main|Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels}}\nThis expansion was released on November 6, 2007, featuring crew and ships from the three [[Pirates of the Caribbean (disambiguation)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] movies, plus some other Disney pirate ships. The new keywords Parley and Eternal were included from the films, along with the new unit type [[Kraken]] (an eight-segmented version of the five-segmented Sea Monster)\nwith considerably different effects.\n\n===Rise of the Fiends===\nReleased January 30, 2008, ''Fiends'' added the Flotilla ship type, and an action ship called ''Scorpion''. The Loyal and Hostile keywords were added, and the Kraken keyword changed to Octopus. In addition to the standard checklist and rules sheet, numbered collectible stories were also included in the booster packs; the mail-in offer was for the Specter, which was a glow-in-the-dark ship. The Octopus Ochobrazo was to appear in this release, but was pulled; this unit does not exist.\n\n===Fire and Steel===\n\"Fire and Steel\" was released April 9, 2008, adding new \"Action\" unit types, Bombardiers and Switchblades, and special Equipment items. More numbered, collectible stories were distributed in packs; a mail-away offer was given for the ''Chum Maker'' Scorpion ship.\n\n===Savage Shores===\n\"Savage Shores\" was the final expansion, released on November 5, 2008, and was the first release to be unavailable in booster packs. It added the new generic crew types Navigator and Cargo Master, the new action ship type Hoist, and the new terrain type Trade Current. In addition, several new island types with special effects were added, as well as the new keywords Dories, Secret Hold, Born Leader and Chieftain. Two new 10-mast ships, the ''Shui-Xian'' and the ''Celtic Fury'', were also released.\n\n===Return to Savage Shores===\n\"Return To Savage Shores\" was scheduled to be released sometime in early 2009 - the design phase was supposedly complete and the set was ready to send to the printers when WizKids was shut down by [[Topps]]. While some information on the units that were to appear in this set is available, the set has not been released and probably never will be.\n\n==Fiction==\nThe Pirates Constructible Strategy Game and its expansions feature flavor text on the styrene cards that hold each ship, fort, and unique crew game pieces. The flavor text forms a roughly connected story that centers on several recurring characters: Jack Hawkins, the cursed pirate El Fantasma, the femme fatale known as the Calico Cat, and others. Although the Pirates expansions span several hundred years (Admiral [[Zheng He]] sailed in the 14th century, and \"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\" is set roughly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] age), the recurring characters never seem to age, but they do develop. As such, [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in the Pirates universe is difficult to establish. Many pieces of flavor text in later expansions reference events, ships, or characters in previous expansions, so there is a coherent - if factually and historically unlikely - plot that continues to develop with each new release.\n\nJack Hawkins is a typical roguish pirate type, similar to [[Jack Sparrow]] in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean]] films. He can often be found stealing ships and gambling them away. El Fantasma's ghostly status was left ambiguous in \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\"; in later expansions, he received his own ghost ship and became a member of the Cursed faction, cementing his role as an actual [[undead]] pirate. The Calico Cat is a strong female character who provides a dramatic balance to Jack Hawkins; she is often depicted as a plucky adventurer who uses both brains and brawn to further some unknown quest for revenge. The Cat also mentors a girl by the name of Bonny Peel. It has been hinted that \"the Cat\" has a personal grudge against Hawkins, and is rumored to be the missing Gunn in the Pirate stories.\n\nSeveral additional recurring characters appear in Pirates fiction, including Blackheart, a pirate similar to the historical [[Blackbeard]]; the Crimson Angel, another mysterious female pirate; and even non-pirates such as Charles Southwyn, a weaponmaster who helped create several ships in the \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\" release. Other notable characters include: Capitan Alarico Castro, a Moor who, despite a grudge against Spain, becomes an Admiral ; Davy Jones, captain of the cursed ship the Flying Dutchman; Genny Gallows whose father was killed by the English; and many others.\n\nIn addition to the flavor text on styrene cards, several pieces of fiction collectively called ''Tales of the Spanish Main'' by [[Noah Dudley]] and [[Nancy Berman]] appeared on WizKids' website before and after the launch of Pirates of the Spanish Main in 2004.\n\nWhile some ships are historical and contain accurate historical descriptions of real events, others are either original fiction, fiction in the public domain (the Pequod from ''[[Moby Dick]]''), mythological creatures, or are homages to fictional ships or characters. For example, some of the Sea Monsters in the Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse expansion are obvious homages to creatures from H.P. Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu mythos]].\n\n===References and homages in Pirates fiction===\nA good deal of Pirates flavor text contains references to historical events or people, other fictional characters or events, or are simply references to the game's writers and designers. Pirates fiction also contains [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s to other pirate fiction. Some ship names are references to other games created by Jordan Weisman. The ''Pandora'' (from \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\") is a reference to the [[zeppelin]] of the same name owned by Nathan Zachary, the main character in Weisman's [[Crimson Skies]] game. The ''Black Swan'' is a reference to a character from Crimson Skies or possibly to the Pirate movie of the same name.\n\nA very incomplete list of other references for the \"Pirates of the Spanish Main (the 1st Set)\" alone includes:\n* ''Revenge'' (PP376/PS007) - Homage to the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]]' ship ''Revenge'' in [[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]] or the real pirate [[Black Bart Roberts]]' ship Revenge.\n* ''Wesley'' - Another homage to ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'', the name of the main hero. Also appears in [[The Princess Bride (film)|film version]]\n* Scrye the Explorer (PP375) - Reference to ''[[Scrye]]'' magazine, in which the promotional piece appeared as an insert.\n* ''Pandora'' (PS006) - Reference to the zeppelin of the same name from the Crimson Skies universe, also created by Weisman, along with the legend of \"[[Pandora's Box]]\".\n* ''Tsuro'' (PP009) - Reference to WizKid's board game [[Tsuro]]\n* \"Jack Hawkins\" - Reference to PotC's [[Jack Sparrow]] (in name and looks) and [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] (Jim and Jack are interchangeable names) who was once in the British navy and turned to piracy.\n* \"Sea monkey\"- reference to the [[Lucasarts]] adventure game [[Secret of Monkey Island]] the flavor text tells the story of it from the game.\n\n==RPG==\nIn 2007 [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group]] released ''The Pirates of the Spanish Main'', a source book for their [[Savage Worlds]] [[role playing game]], set in the same world as the CSG.<ref>[http://www.peginc.com/games.html]</ref>\n\n==Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck card game==\nAnnounced March 7, 2012, \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\u2122 Shuffling the Deck\" is reportedly a non-collectable, stand alone card game for the entire family set in the Pirates of the Spanish Main universe. It has a tentative release date of July 18, 2012. It is not expected to be usable in any way with the collectable miniatures game.\n\n==Cross-promotional (i.e., advertising related) game pieces==\n*2004 - '''Scrye the Explorer''' (SM card # PP735) - Exclusive Explorer crew packed in the Sept. 2004 ''[[Scrye]]'' magazine (issue 75) along with the ship ''Bloody Throne''.\n*2004 - ''The Bloody Throne'' (SM card # PP375) - Exclusive three-masted ship packed in the Sept. 2004 ''Scrye'' magazine (issue 75) with the crew card \"Scrye the Explorer\".\n*2006 - ''Gale Force Nine'' (SCS card # 301) - A four-masted Pirate ship LE, free by mail with proof-of-purchase when you buy either one of two island terrain sets from the [http://www.gf9.com Gale Force Nine] game company.\n*2006 - ''Two Home islands'' released with the \"Donald Duck & Co. #26\" (Kalle Anka) comic magazine only in Scandinavia on 7/20/06 - these packs contained two ships (''El Cazadora'' & ''Glorious Treasure'', both identical to their English releases), a paper slip of treasure coins to cut out, rules, and two cardboard islands which are labelled \"Home\" on one side. Due to their limited distribution, these two islands are highly prized by completist collectors and quite hard to come by.\n*2007 - ''USS Denver'' (Ocean's Edge card # SOE 07) - four-masted American ship available with a $25.00 purchase from the cross-promoted Sony Online Entertainment online version of this game.\n*2007 - ''Flying Dutchman'' (DPOTC card # 300) - Special Edition Promo ship with advertising text, tied into the Disney related Pirates of the Caribbean set.

This release included four new Pirates of the Revolution ships, (''Franklin, Concord, Red Curse'', and ''Hangman's Noose''). These four ships only exist in the \"UL\" (Unlimited) version.\n*2005 - Pirates of the North Pole Ship & Crew (''The Sleigh'' & Captain Whitebeard - Distributed to WizKids employees, envoys, registered retail venues and business associates as a Holiday present. Also given away in a drawing for members of WizKids online Pirates community. The Sleigh and Captain Whitebeard can be used any day of the year, however on Christmas Eve they gain special bonuses.\n*2006 - Value Boxes (Davy Jones Curse) - Wave 1 had new ships (''Boneyard, Fool's Gold, Electric Eel, and Drowned Man'') and Wave 2 included new ships (''Broken Key, Black Diamond, Nightmare and HMS Richard'').

Available after sending in 'four lost pieces' of armory found on crew/treasure cards, four wrappers, receipt of purchase, and postage.\n*2007 - Value Boxes (Ocean's Edge) - new ships (''Last Hope, Jape, HMS Burma, USS Seattle'').\n*2007 - 10-masted Pirate Treasure Ship (''Zeus'') - Same requirements as the Guichuan (12 \"regular\" wrappers or 12 \"mega-pack\" wrappers or a combination of both, alongside a coupon from the site and proof-of-purchase).\n*2007 - Value Boxes (Pirates of the Caribbean) - new ships (''HMS Diamond, HMS Phoenix, Neptune, Sea Nymph'').\n*2008 - Rise of the Fiends Cursed Ship (''Specter'') - originally customers had to mail in the Specter story (a paper insert) from a pack, but after a packaging problem in which few of these actually packed, WizKids changed this to any story from this set, plus a receipt & postage.\n*2008 - Value Boxes (Rise of the Fiends) - new ships (''HMS Forge, Rusty Harpoon, Hades' Realm, Isabela'').\n*2008 - Value Boxes (Fire & Steel) - new ships (''HMS Resolution, Nox, Lucky Seven, Crocodile'').\n*2008 - Fire & Steel Cursed Scorpion Ship (''Chum Maker'') - customers had to mail in the Chum Maker story (a paper insert) from a pack plus a receipt, wrapper and postage.\n*2008 - Promo Ship ''Obago Deuce'' - This extremely rare ship was scheduled to be a late year promo for in-store handout, but was only distributed in very limited quantities to employees and convention-helper Privateers. Some have made their way out on the resellers market as well. About 30 are known to exist, but more are assumed to have been printed. As such, this is the rarest 'produced ship' in the series, and highly sought after by collectors, though thoroughly unspectacular in game-play.\n\n==Other collectible elements, tins and other unusual releases==\n*2004 - Set of eight mini-busts (statuettes) of Pirates of the Spanish Main characters, including: Calico Cat PP388, Captain Blackheart PP389, Jack Hawkins PP390, Christopher Myngs PP391, El Fantasma PP392, Diana Doone PP393, Luys de Alva PP394 and Skyme the Monkey PP395.\n*2004 - A series of Pirate-themed temporary tattoos were given out at conventions.

Most of these pieces had a small gold sticker \"seal of authenticity\"  from WizKids.\n*2005 - Jack Hawkins Advantage Trophy (PP471) - a full color \"trophy\" / bust featuring pirate Jack Hawkins, which was larger and much more detailed than the earlier mini-busts.\n*2005 - Six different tan Pirates of the Spanish Main tins containing three Spanish Main and one Revolution booster pack.\n*2005 - Six different blue Pirates of the Revolution tins, sold in mass market retail outlets such [[Wal-Mart]] (contained no unique new pieces).\n*2006 - Gale Force Nine licensed items for use in the game, including a ship (Gale Force Nine), a special vinyl map, a booty finder pack (containing island exploration tokens and a range finder tool), and two different 3-D island sets.\n*2006 - Special \"UK only\" tins containing one pack of each of the first five releases available at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] (which contained no unique new pieces, despite WizKids' announcement that they would).\n*2007 - Ocean's Edge \"Megapacks\" containing 1 of 6 random \"megacards\" (Skipping Stone, ''HMS Hermes'', Shal-Bala, Angelica, Ghost Walker, Mystic).\n*2007 - Six different \"Ocean's Edge\" tins featuring OE packs and multiple faction specific, tin-exclusive cards (card numbers 143-162) released to various retailers (two designs of which were exclusive to Target and WalMart stores respectively, and contained factions not found in the other tins).\n*2007 - Four different \"Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels \" tins featuring one of four Special Edition \"Megacard\" Krakens eight \"masted\" monsters), 10 ships, three terrain cards, five or more crew or treasure cards, two dice, complete game rules.

A packing error made these stories very hard to collect as they do not appear in every pack as advertised - more like one in ten packs.\n*2008 - Fire & Steel \"stories\", one of ten possible paper inserts which appear randomly in every booster pack.\n*2008 - A \"treasure chest\" shaped tin containing various packs and one of four exclusive Rise of the Fiends megacards (''USS Mercury'', ''Polaris'', ''Terrox'' and ''Grinder'').\n*2008 - a \"Scavenger Pack\" box containing three packs worth of Savage Shores items, one pack each of Rise of the Fiends and Fire & Steel, and one of six exclusive pre-assembled Megasized ships (visible in a window on the box).

It was released in early July 2004.<ref name=\"icv2\"/> There was also an online computer game based on Pirates of the Spanish Main by Sony Online Entertainment called [[Pirates CSG Online]], which ended on 1/31/2011.\n\nThe game won the [[Origins Award|Origins]] Vanguard Award 2005.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, collectible maker [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] announced the purchase of the Wizkids name and properties from Topps, specifically including the ''Pirates'' line, which was canceled.\n\nOn March 9, 2012, Wizkids announced that they plan to release a card-only version of the game, called \"Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck.\"<ref>http://wizkidsgames.com/blog/2012/03/09/necawizkids-announces-the-re-launch-of-the-pirates-of-the-spanish-main-property/</ref> Other games have since followed in their \"Shuffling the Deck\" line of card games.\n\n== Description ==\nThe general goal of Pirates is to collect more gold than your opponents,<ref name=\"icv2\"/> or with variants, to achieve a given objective or destroy all enemy ships (numerous scenarios written by WizKids and others have vastly extended the playability of the game). The game's pieces include ships, forts, sea monsters, crew, islands and other terrain markers, events, gold and other treasure tokens.\n\nAn innovative feature of Pirates is the 'constructible' element of the game; each game piece (except for terrain) is created by popping out the small [[polystyrene]] pieces from placeholder cards and assembling them. As the ship, fort or sea monster is damaged by enemies during the course of game play, pieces of it are removed to record how much damage it has sustained, giving the game piece itself the appearance of slowly being destroyed. The elements removed from the piece - for example, a ship's masts - can no longer be used in the game unless another game element allows it to be replaced later.\n\nEach game piece has a point value that is related to its overall power. The more powerful a piece, the higher its point value. Players assemble fleets of ships, monsters, forts, and crew based an agreed-upon point total, similar to the manner in which many miniature war games are played. This helps balance each player's fleet, and means that the construction of a fleet can be as strategically important as the gameplay itself.\n\nThe action takes place on a tabletop or similar flat surface rather than a game board; before play begins, players take turns populating the play area with various pieces of terrain like islands, fog banks, and sargasso seas. Face-down gold or treasure tokens are then placed on each island. After creating the play area, players then place their fleets and gameplay begins.\n\nPlayers take turns moving their ships around the play area, landing on islands and exploring them, which reveals the value of the gold and treasure tokens on that island. Ships then collect treasure and attempt to return it to their home islands before their opponents. Since the game's [[Game mechanic#Victory condition mechanics|victory condition]]s include both gold collection and the destruction of all enemy fleets, there are several different strategies that can lead to victory: trying to destroy an opponent before he or she can gather gold; building a fast and strong enough fleet to avoid being destroyed; or, most common, a mix of both.\n\nThe game is packaged so that one person may play the game with only one game pack, but several more packs are required to play using the full rules. Additionally, the game is far more enjoyable and balanced when each player has a larger selection of game pieces from which to choose when assembling their fleets.\n\nThe recommended \"sweet spot\" for playability appears to be three to five players on a 90&nbsp;cm by 90&nbsp;cm (3 foot by 3 foot) 'ocean'.\n\n==Configurations==\nThe game is primarily sold in \"game packs\", foil-wrapped packs of randomized styrene cards and other game components roughly the same size as a pack of [[baseball cards]] or other [[trading card game]] packs such as [[Magic: The Gathering]]. Each pack includes a randomized combination of two constructible game pieces: ships (including forts and sea monsters), and various crew, treasure and terrain. These game pieces are numbered and collectible, and come in multiple levels of rarity designated by a color-coded triangle on each card's corner - the most common rarities for standard booster pack items are : Common (white for generic crew, red for ships), Uncommon (silver-grey), Rare (yellow), or Super Rare (black). Other rarity designations for non-pack ships include \"Special Edition\" (green), a one-off Promo (purple), and \"Limited Edition\" (copper) for tournament prize ships.\n\nUnlike most trading card games, due to the limited number of game pieces in each pack, some packs do not contain any Rare or Super Rare game pieces, or may contain multiple Rares. Any given set's Super-Rares will always come all together in the same pack. Each pack also contains a cardboard island (the reverse side in later sets has printed terrain such as a fog bank, sargasso sea, or reef), a checklist and set of rules, a crew/treasure card (which may include gold pieces for use in the game), and a mini-die. Each pack generally costs $4 US.\n\nWizKids released other game configurations as well, mostly into mass market channels such as [[Toys \"R\" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Wal-Mart]]. These include but are not limited to:\n*'''Promotional pieces and packs''': Various ships since the game's inception have been sent to retailers to be given away, usually in a clear plastic wrappers. Some of these are Limited Edition items, and some are duplicates of items found in common booster packs.\n*'''Tins''': A small tin box decorated with Pirates artwork which contains multiple Pirates booster packs. With ''Ocean's Edge'', some Special Edition tin exclusive card packs were also included in the tins. Also released were \"Mega Tins\" - slightly larger tins containing ''Ocean's Edge'' booster packs, and a special plastic wrapped pack containing faction-specific junk ships and crew. Two of the factions were only available in Tins exclusive to specific US retailers, Wal-Mart and Target. Finally, ''Rise of the Fiends'' \"Treasure Chest Tins\" contained one of four Megacards.\n*'''Value Boxes''': A small cardboard box with a window in it, typically containing one of four possible Special Edition prebuilt ship, crew, standard gold treasure, islands, and occasionally a full-sized die. The prebuilt ships have a green corner rarity indicator which is referred to as \"Special Edition\". These have been released for a number of sets since ''Revolution''.\n*'''Megapacks''': A booster pack twice the size of normal packs, containing four ships or monsters, a megacard (double-sized card), one mini-die, and several terrain. Released so far only for ''Oceans' Edge''.\n\nOn October 25, 2006, WizKids released \"[[Pirates: Quest For Davy Jones' Gold]]\", a non-collectible [[board game]] version of the Pirates game that uses gameplay elements and game pieces from the constructible strategy game, but is designed to be simplified, self-contained and sold in the board game section of retail stores.\n\n== Factions ==\nShips, forts, sea monsters and crew are members of various [[Political faction|faction]]s. The factions exist largely for fictional purposes, but there are certain game mechanics that use the factions as well. \n* The [[Pirates]], representing the popular view of Pirates around the \"Golden Age of Piracy\". They are absent in '''Pirates of the Barbary Coast'''.\n* The [[England|English]], representing England and later the [[British Empire]].\n* The [[Spain|Spanish]], representing Spain and its empire in the [[new world]].\n* The [[France|French]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\", representing first the French empire and then the Napoleonic empire in later expansions.\n* The [[United States|Americans]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Revolution\", who represent the American colonies during and after the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n* The [[Barbary pirates|Barbary Corsairs]], who represent the pirates that operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during this time period. They only appear in \"Pirates of the Barbary Coast\".\n* The Jade Rebellion, a fictional group representing a confederation of 'Asian' pirate-revolutionaries in the [[South China Sea]]. They only appear in \"Pirates of the South China Seas\", with the exception of a super-rare \"intro\" pack from PotBC.\n* The Cursed, a label encompassing various evil supernatural characters, ships and sea monsters.\n* The [[Mercenaries]], introduced in \"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\" are a collection of [[steampunk]]-like scientists, revolutionaries and ships, including submarines.\n* The [[Vikings]] introduced in \"Pirates of the Frozen North\" are not historical Vikings, but [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors who use Viking [[mythology]], symbols and names for their ships.\n\n== Releases ==\n\n===Pirates of the Spanish Main===\n\"Pirates of the Spanish Main\" was the first release, and hit stores on July 28, 2004. It quickly sold out in many places, resulting in a second \"limited\" print run which featured noticeably higher quality printing than the first print run (the first run cards appear extremely 'faded'). This set was printed in a number of languages: English, German, French and Spanish. The only other sets printed in a foreign language (German) were \"Crimson Coast\", \"Revolution\", \"Davy Jones' Curse\", \"Mysterious Islands\", and \"Ocean's Edge\".\n\nThe set introduced the Pirate, English, and Spanish factions, with ships for each faction ranging in size from one to five masts. Twelve named crew members, along with the generic crew of [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]], [[Helmsman]], [[Musketeer]], [[Shipwright]], [[Oarsman]], [[Cannoneer]], and [[exploration|Explorer]] were also present for each faction. A number of generic treasure, in the form of gold pieces ranging in value from 1 to 7, as well as nine pieces of named unique treasure were included, along with an assortment of cardboard islands with blank backs.\n\nAt the 2004 [[Origins Award]]s ''Pirates of the Spanish Main'' was one of the winners of the ''Vanguard Awards''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2004/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (2004) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603142308/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2004/list-of-winners |archivedate=June 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Pirates of the Crimson Coast===\n{{main|Pirates of the Crimson Coast}}\nThe first expansion was released on March 2, 2005, and added the French faction, as well as the unit type of [[Fort]]s, which were placed on islands to defend them. It expanded the rules with the Ghost Ship and Schooner ship types; the Broadsides Attack, Limit, and Ransom keywords; and two new generic crew types, the Stinkpot and [[Chainshot]] Specialists. Fog Banks, Reefs, and [[Sargasso Sea]]s were added to the back of the islands as special terrain. The set also previewed the forthcoming American faction with the ship ''[[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]]''.\n\n===Pirates of the Spanish Main - Unlimited Edition===\nThis edition was released on March 15, 2005, as a second reprint of the cards from the original \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\". The numbering scheme on the cards was updated to conform with the \"Pirates of the Crimson Coast\" numbering and rarity colors. A checklist of the cards was also added. In Europe, the expansion removed the island cards and in their place issued new rules for ship movement and a playmat.\n\n===Pirates of the Revolution===\n{{main|Pirates of the Revolution}}\nReleased in June 2005, \"Revolution\" added the new American faction, and special Event cards (Divers, Raft, Mermaids, Foul Winds and Becalmed). In addition, the [[Marine (armed services)|Marine]] keyword and [[Galley]] ship type debuted, along with the new generic crew Firepot Specialist.\n\n===Pirates of the Barbary Coast===\n{{main|Pirates of the Barbary Coast}}\nReleased on October 26, 2005, this set added the [[Barbary Pirates|Barbary Corsair]] faction, and a new generic crew type, the Smokepot Specialist. Four super-rare cards (two ships and two crew) previewed the forthcoming [[Jade Rebellion]] faction. It is the only set to lack the Pirate faction.\n\n===Pirates of the South China Seas===\n{{main|Pirates of the South China Seas}}\nThis expansion was released on February 22, 2006, and added the Jade Rebellion's [[Junk (ship)|Junk]] and [[Turtle Ship]] types, as well as the Fear keyword and game mechanic. Six new Events (Hidden Cove, Favor of the Gods, Rolling Fog, False Treasure, Duel, Cursed Zone) were included, as well as the first six-masted ships. The super-rares for this set previewed the new Cursed faction (two ships and two unique treasures). WizKids offered a mail-in promotion for the first 10-master, a junk treasure ship called the [[Baochuan]] and her captain Admiral [[Zheng He]].\n\n====Notable ships====\n\n*Glorious Treasure - Jade Rebellion, 1-mast, 2 armor, 6 points.  This ship can deal up to 2 masts of damage and kill one crew when it rams an enemy ship making this ship worth far above 6 points.  The armor and its '''turtle ship''' ability enable it to take twice as many hits as a normal 1-mast ship. Its cannon is decent and the ship is of average speed.  This ship can even destroy a 3-mast ship with only minor damage unlike most 1-mast ships. It is very vulnerable to being hit with a firepot specialist.\n*Grand Path - Jade Rebellion, 6-mast, 17 points, with 6 2S cannons and a special ability to add +1 to boarding rolls.\n*Feathered Hat - Pirate, 4-mast, 12 points.  The Feathered Hat has average cannons (2S 3S 3S 3S) and good speed (S+L) but her ability is powerful\u2014the Feathered Hat can be crewed by any nationality.  Her 3 cargo preclude her from being very useful as a treasure runner but taking on three crew from any nation could make her downright lethal.\n*USS New Orleans - America, 2-mast, 12 points.  This ship can hide behind something and then pop out to steal a derelict ship.  Both of the ships become \"teleported\" to the home island removing both from danger.  In a large battle, this ship has a high value for recovery.\n*Santa Ana - Spain, 4-mast, 15 points. Santa Ana could be considered a weaker version of the powerful HMS Titan, as it can receive an extra action on a 5 or a 6. It has slightly above average cannons, sporting 2 rank 2 S range cannons, and 2 rank 3 L range cannons. Its 5 cargo allows it to become a powerful flagship.\n\n====Notable crew====\n\n*Pirate - The Headhunter (sacrifice a crew for extra action; +1 to cannon rolls vs. non-Pirates). The Headhunter was named by a winner of the world's first Pirates of the Spanish Main event and subsequent [[auction]] at [[Gen Con]] Indy 2004.\n*French - Princess Arii Auraa (0pts, crew cost 0 on this ship)\n*American - Commodore Matthew Perry (0LR, +5 fleet points)\n*Jade Rebellion\n**Zheng Li Kwan (sacrifice a crew for extra action; treasure switcher)\n**Ms. Cheng (0LR reroll 1 die per turn)\n**Dragon Eyes (10 points, may capture enemy crew for gold when boarding)\n**Li Quin (0LR +5 fleet points)\n**The Nameless (1+ to boadring rolls)\n\n===Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse===\n{{cleanup|reason=merged information overlengthy in comparison to rest of article|date=December 2014}}\n\"Davy Jones' Curse\" was released on May 31, 2006, featuring the new Cursed faction, and the [[Sea Monster]] unit type, which acted as ship but could not carry crew. A mail-in promotion offered a 10-masted Cursed ship, the ''Guichuan'', and her captain Headhunter.\n\n'''Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse''' is an expansion set for the [[constructible strategy game]] [[Pirates of the Spanish Main]] produced by [[WizKids]]. It expanded on [[The Cursed]] Faction and was released on May 31, 2006.\n\n'''Set details'''\n*The expansion includes cards for the following factions:\n** American\n** Cursed\n** Pirate\n** English\n** French\n** Spanish\n*The die color in this set is red (d6).\n*The set introduced [[Sea Monster]]s, The Cursed faction, and a new keyword - the Black Mark.\n*The Black Mark - This crew may start as if it belonged to the Cursed faction, play it face up if so. The ship that the crew is part of is now considered to belong to the Cursed Nation. If played face up in this way, the crew's point cost is increased by 1.\n*Four super rare cards ('''Mist Walker, Behemoth, Screaming Mimi and The Red Skull''') may be found in a single pack which is indistinguishable from a normal card pack. Super Rare packs appear approximately 1 in 100 packs. In a first for this game line, these cards are printed on a semi-translucent plastic stock, giving them a 'ghostly' appearance.\n*Value Box Sets: This is the first (and so far only) set to feature 'two runs' of Value Box sets, 8 altogether.  Each value box contains 6 ships and/or sea monsters, 3 crew and/or treasure, as well as 2 islands, and 1 full size (d6) die. Initially, four special edition ships were issued ('''Boneyard, Electric Eel, Drowned Man, and Fool's Gold'''). A further four \"special edition\" boxes with new ships ('''The Black Diamond, Broken Key, Nightmare and HMS Richard''') was released later, in October 2006.\n**Value Box Trivia: a packaging 'exploit' led to buyers being able to see into any value box without opening it, and because the Davey Jones Super Rares have a translucent appearance, tell if the Super Rare pack was a part of that particular Value Box or not before purchase. This was corrected in following sets by adding an opaque insert to block the view.\n* This set consists of 144 pieces in the base set, with an additional 18 Limited Edition Ships given as Tournament Prizes, and one convention exclusive ship for a grand total of 160 cards (Not including the different versions of islands). Game pieces are numbered 001-145, 200-217 and 300.\n* 18 Limited Edition, one & two masted ships are available as tournament prize LE's, which were distributed to the public in a new fashion for this set: one package of three different LE ships is included in each 36-count retail Booster Box (apparently with the idea that the game store will remove the package before selling the box or packs and give the LE ships to winning tournament players). In practice, many of these packs ended up thrown away or auctioned on eBay. Additional prize packages of these cards were apparently mailed later on to a few tournament Envoys as well, but this new distribution method for tournament prize cards led to these particular cards being much harder to collect, and they still command large prices when they appear at auction.\n* '''The Guichuan''' - a 10-masted ghost junk, was part of a special giveaway - twelve pack wrappers, receipt from the store the packs were purchased at, and a shipping and handling fee were required for the giveaway. It also included a crew called '''The Headhunter''' on the ship card.\n\n'''Sea Monsters'''\nThe concept of Sea Monsters was introduced in this set, with ten sea monster pieces (8 are rare, 2<sup>*</sup> are super rare): Leviathan, Calim, Calypsos, Mist Walker<sup>*</sup>, Behemoth<sup>*</sup>, Tiamat, Tsuro, Slarge Gubbit, Jormungandr, and Gog-Clocthoth.\n\nControllers decide whether the Monster is submerged (movement only), or surfaced (move or attack). Two of the monsters have breath weapons, Tiamat has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. Leviathan has ranked breath attack that works like a firepot. The others have game-changing abilities such as moving in and out of fog banks (Mist Walker) - this ability is commonly called a 'fog hopper' - and eliminating masts or crew in boarding actions. Behemoth can copy another ability. Tsuro may move an opponents ship, (with proper dice roll).\n\nLater sets fiddled with keywords such as 'Kraken', 'Titan', 'Octopus', 'Sea Dragon' and others, but for this set, the keyword was simply \"Sea Monster\" regardless of the creature type.\n\n'''Notable ships'''\n*[[The Flying Dutchman]] - A famous ghost ship with five 2+ to hit cannons.\n*Harbinger - A ship captained by the pirate Jack Hawkins that can board other ships without having to ram them if the ship is in short distance away from her.\n*[[The Pequod]] - Famous ship from the novel [[Moby-Dick]].\n*El Raton - an error in printing shows this ship as a common (red color corner) card, it is actually a rare as shown on both the checklist and the WizKids card gallery.\n\n'''Notable crew'''\n*[[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] - The Cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones is a separate legend, but was linked by Wizkids to the Dutchman. (This was done to tie it in with the films, The Pirates of the Caribbean.) The Dutchman was either the name of the ship, or a nickname for her Captain. Depending on which myth you hear.\n*The Inquisitor - (Black Mark) A mysterious figure around which many Spanish ships are linked, he can remove all crew on a ship if a boarding action is won.\n\n===Pirates of the Mysterious Islands===\nReleased on November 15, 2006, \"Mysterious Islands\" added the new [[Mercenary]] faction, along with [[Jules Verne]] inspired [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]-style submarines. The titular \"Mysterious Islands\" were added as special islands with effects decided by dice rolls.\n\n===Pirates of the Frozen North===\n{{main|Pirates of the Frozen North}}\n\"Frozen North\", released on February 14, 2007, added the Norse [[Vikings]] faction and the [[Iceberg]] terrain type, as well as the [[Icebreaker]] and [[Longship]] ship types. Islands were numbered for the first time in this set. A mail-in promotion offered the \"Nordic Raiders Pack\" with the ''Serpent's Fang'' and ''Polaris'' ships and the ''Odin's Revenge'' unique treasure.\n\n===Pirates at Ocean's Edge===\n{{main|Pirates at Ocean's Edge}}\nReleased on April 18, 2007, \"Ocean's Edge\" added [[Whirlpools]] as a terrain type, Windcatchers and [[Catamaran]]s as new ship types, and [[Sea monster|Sea Dragons]] and Titans (giant crabs) as new monster types. A 10-masted ship called the ''Zeus'' and her captain Emperor Blackheart were available as a mail-in promotion.\n\n===Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels===\n{{main|Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModels}}\nThis expansion was released on November 6, 2007, featuring crew and ships from the three [[Pirates of the Caribbean (disambiguation)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] movies, plus some other Disney pirate ships. The new keywords Parley and Eternal were included from the films, along with the new unit type [[Kraken]] (an eight-segmented version of the five-segmented Sea Monster)\nwith considerably different effects.\n\n===Rise of the Fiends===\nReleased January 30, 2008, ''Fiends'' added the Flotilla ship type, and an action ship called ''Scorpion''. The Loyal and Hostile keywords were added, and the Kraken keyword changed to Octopus. In addition to the standard checklist and rules sheet, numbered collectible stories were also included in the booster packs; the mail-in offer was for the Specter, which was a glow-in-the-dark ship. The Octopus Ochobrazo was to appear in this release, but was pulled; this unit does not exist.\n\n===Fire and Steel===\n\"Fire and Steel\" was released April 9, 2008, adding new \"Action\" unit types, Bombardiers and Switchblades, and special Equipment items. More numbered, collectible stories were distributed in packs; a mail-away offer was given for the ''Chum Maker'' Scorpion ship.\n\n===Savage Shores===\n\"Savage Shores\" was the final expansion, released on November 5, 2008, and was the first release to be unavailable in booster packs. It added the new generic crew types Navigator and Cargo Master, the new action ship type Hoist, and the new terrain type Trade Current. In addition, several new island types with special effects were added, as well as the new keywords Dories, Secret Hold, Born Leader and Chieftain. Two new 10-mast ships, the ''Shui-Xian'' and the ''Celtic Fury'', were also released.\n\n===Return to Savage Shores===\n\"Return To Savage Shores\" was scheduled to be released sometime in early 2009 - the design phase was supposedly complete and the set was ready to send to the printers when WizKids was shut down by [[Topps]]. While some information on the units that were to appear in this set is available, the set has not been released and probably never will be.\n\n==Fiction==\nThe Pirates Constructible Strategy Game and its expansions feature flavor text on the styrene cards that hold each ship, fort, and unique crew game pieces. The flavor text forms a roughly connected story that centers on several recurring characters: Jack Hawkins, the cursed pirate El Fantasma, the femme fatale known as the Calico Cat, and others. Although the Pirates expansions span several hundred years (Admiral [[Zheng He]] sailed in the 14th century, and \"Pirates of the Mysterious Islands\" is set roughly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] age), the recurring characters never seem to age, but they do develop. As such, [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in the Pirates universe is difficult to establish. Many pieces of flavor text in later expansions reference events, ships, or characters in previous expansions, so there is a coherent - if factually and historically unlikely - plot that continues to develop with each new release.\n\nJack Hawkins is a typical roguish pirate type, similar to [[Jack Sparrow]] in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean]] films. He can often be found stealing ships and gambling them away. El Fantasma's ghostly status was left ambiguous in \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\"; in later expansions, he received his own ghost ship and became a member of the Cursed faction, cementing his role as an actual [[undead]] pirate. The Calico Cat is a strong female character who provides a dramatic balance to Jack Hawkins; she is often depicted as a plucky adventurer who uses both brains and brawn to further some unknown quest for revenge. The Cat also mentors a girl by the name of Bonny Peel. It has been hinted that \"the Cat\" has a personal grudge against Hawkins, and is rumored to be the missing Gunn in the Pirate stories.\n\nSeveral additional recurring characters appear in Pirates fiction, including Blackheart, a pirate similar to the historical [[Blackbeard]]; the Crimson Angel, another mysterious female pirate; and even non-pirates such as Charles Southwyn, a weaponmaster who helped create several ships in the \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\" release. Other notable characters include: Capitan Alarico Castro, a Moor who, despite a grudge against Spain, becomes an Admiral ; Davy Jones, captain of the cursed ship the Flying Dutchman; Genny Gallows whose father was killed by the English; and many others.\n\nIn addition to the flavor text on styrene cards, several pieces of fiction collectively called ''Tales of the Spanish Main'' by [[Noah Dudley]] and [[Nancy Berman]] appeared on WizKids' website before and after the launch of Pirates of the Spanish Main in 2004.\n\nWhile some ships are historical and contain accurate historical descriptions of real events, others are either original fiction, fiction in the public domain (the Pequod from ''[[Moby Dick]]''), mythological creatures, or are homages to fictional ships or characters. For example, some of the Sea Monsters in the Pirates of Davy Jones' Curse expansion are obvious homages to creatures from H.P. Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu mythos]].\n\n===References and homages in Pirates fiction===\nA good deal of Pirates flavor text contains references to historical events or people, other fictional characters or events, or are simply references to the game's writers and designers. Pirates fiction also contains [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s to other pirate fiction. Some ship names are references to other games created by Jordan Weisman. The ''Pandora'' (from \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\") is a reference to the [[zeppelin]] of the same name owned by Nathan Zachary, the main character in Weisman's [[Crimson Skies]] game. The ''Black Swan'' is a reference to a character from Crimson Skies or possibly to the Pirate movie of the same name.\n\nA very incomplete list of other references for the \"Pirates of the Spanish Main (the 1st Set)\" alone includes:\n* ''Revenge'' (PP376/PS007) - Homage to the [[Dread Pirate Roberts]]' ship ''Revenge'' in [[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]] or the real pirate [[Black Bart Roberts]]' ship Revenge.\n* ''Wesley'' - Another homage to ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'', the name of the main hero.

Due to their limited distribution, these two islands are highly prized by completist collectors and quite hard to come by.\n*2007 - ''USS Denver'' (Ocean's Edge card # SOE 07) - four-masted American ship available with a $25.00 purchase from the cross-promoted Sony Online Entertainment online version of this game.\n*2007 - ''Flying Dutchman'' (DPOTC card # 300) - Special Edition Promo ship with advertising text, tied into the Disney related Pirates of the Caribbean set.

As such, this is the rarest 'produced ship' in the series, and highly sought after by collectors, though thoroughly unspectacular in game-play.\n\n==Other collectible elements, tins and other unusual releases==\n*2004 - Set of eight mini-busts (statuettes) of Pirates of the Spanish Main characters, including: Calico Cat PP388, Captain Blackheart PP389, Jack Hawkins PP390, Christopher Myngs PP391, El Fantasma PP392, Diana Doone PP393, Luys de Alva PP394 and Skyme the Monkey PP395.\n*2004 - A series of Pirate-themed temporary tattoos were given out at conventions.

A packing error made these stories very hard to collect as they do not appear in every pack as advertised - more like one in ten packs.\n*2008 - Fire & Steel \"stories\", one of ten possible paper inserts which appear randomly in every booster pack.\n*2008 - A \"treasure chest\" shaped tin containing various packs and one of four exclusive Rise of the Fiends megacards (''USS Mercury'', ''Polaris'', ''Terrox'' and ''Grinder'').\n*2008 - a \"Scavenger Pack\" box containing three packs worth of Savage Shores items, one pack each of Rise of the Fiends and Fire & Steel, and one of six exclusive pre-assembled Megasized ships (visible in a window on the box).

As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], of whom he later wrote an [[unauthorized biography]]. He became widely known as the \"'''Ettrick Shepherd'''\", a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'', published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. He is best known today for his novel ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]''. His other works include the long poem ''[[The Queen's Wake]]'' (1813), his collection of songs ''[[Jacobite Relics]]'' (1819), and his two novels ''[[The Three Perils of Man]]'' (1822), and ''[[The Three Perils of Woman]]'' (1823).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJames Hogg was born on a small farm near [[Ettrick, Scotland]] in 1770 and was [[baptized]] there on 9 December, his actual date of birth having never been recorded.<ref name=\"literary\">{{Cite web| last=Hughes | first=Gillian | title=James Hogg | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2168 | date=5 November 2001 | publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia | accessdate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> His father, Robert Hogg (1729\u20131820), was a tenant farmer while his mother, Margaret Hogg (n\u00e9e Laidlaw) (1730\u20131813), was noted for collecting native Scottish [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"literary\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Cite web | last=Gilbert | first=Suzanne | title=Hogg, Traditional Culture, and The Mountain Bard | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | date=19 May 2006 | publisher=University of Stirling | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212803/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Margaret Laidlaw's father, known as Will o' Phawhope, was said to have been the last man in the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Border country]] to speak with the [[Fairy|fairies]].<ref name=\"Buchan\">{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |page=62 }}</ref> James was the second eldest of four brothers, his siblings being William, David, and Robert (from eldest to youngest).<ref name=\"stirling\">{{Cite web | title=Sketch of the Life of the Ettrick Shepherd | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212825/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Robert and David later emigrated to the United States, while James and William remained in Scotland for their entire lives.<ref name=\"stirling\"/>\n\nJames attended a parish school for a few months before his education was stopped due to his father's bankruptcy as a stock-farmer and sheep-dealer. Robert Hogg was then given the position of shepherd at Ettrickhouse farm by one of his neighbours. James worked as a farm servant throughout his childhood, tending cows, doing general farm work, and acting as a shepherd's assistant. His early experiences of literature and story telling came from the Bible and his mother's and uncle's stories.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlvi</ref> In 1784 he purchased a fiddle with money that he had saved, and taught himself how to play it. In 1785 he served a year working for a tenant farmer at Singlee. In 1786 he went to work for Mr. Laidlaw of Ellibank, staying with him for eighteen months. In 1788 he was given his first job as a shepherd by Laidlaw's father, a farmer at Willenslee. He stayed here for two years, learning to read while tending sheep, and being given newspapers and theological works by his employer's wife.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlvi\u2013xlvii</ref>\n[[File:Farmhouse at Blackhouse - geograph.org.uk - 2921.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The farmhouse at Blackhouse, where Hogg worked as a young man]]\n\nIn 1790 he began ten years of service to James Laidlaw of Blackhouse in the [[Yarrow Water|Yarrow]] valley. Hogg later said that Laidlaw was more like a father to him than an employer. Seeing how hard he was working to improve himself, Laidlaw offered to help by making books available for Hogg from his own library, and through a local lending library. Hogg also began composing songs to be sung by local girls. He became a lifelong friend of his master's son, William Laidlaw, himself a minor writer and later the [[amanuensis]] of Walter Scott. It was at this time that Hogg, his eldest brother, and several cousins, formed a literary society of shepherds.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlvii</ref>\n\nHogg first became familiar with the work of the recently deceased [[Robert Burns]] in 1797, after having the poem ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'' read to him. During this period Hogg wrote plays and pastorals, and continued producing songs. His work as a sheep drover stimulated an interest in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In 1800 he left Blackhouse to help take care of his parents at Ettrickhouse. His collection ''Scottish Pastorals'' was published early in 1801 to favourable reviews. His patriotic song \"Donald Macdonald\" also achieved popularity.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1801 Hogg was recruited to collect ballads for [[Walter Scott]]'s collection ''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. He met Scott himself the following year and began working for the ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 18\u201322</ref> In the summer of 1802 he embarked on the first of three tours of the Highlands with a view to securing a farm of his own.<ref>Gilkison, Bruce (2016), ''Walking with James Hogg'', Edinburgh University Press</ref> He eventually found a farm on Harris but due to trouble with his finances and a legal issue he was unable to secure a lease by 1804. His experiences on his Highland tours were described in letters to Scott which were published in the ''Scots Magazine''.<ref>Laughlan, William F. (Ed.)

In 1805\u201306 he worked as a shepherd, meeting the poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] and becoming friends with him and his family. In October 1806 he became the lover of a young woman named Catherine Henderson.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlviii</ref>\n\nHis first collection, ''[[The Mountain Bard]]'', was published in February 1807 by [[Constable & Robinson|Constable]].

At the end of 1809 he began an affair with Elizabeth Beattie, and soon after absconded from his creditors, returning in disgrace to Ettrick.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\"/>\n\nIn 1810 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] to start a literary career. In March 1810 his daughter by Elizabeth Beattie was born, christened Elizabeth Hogg in June. At the end of 1810 he met his future wife Margaret Phillips. His magazine ''[[The Spy (periodical by James Hogg)|The Spy]]'', begun in 1810, ended after a year. At this time he became a member of a debate society called ''The Forum'', eventually serving as its secretary. In 1812 he started planning a long poetical work. ''The Queen's Wake'' (the setting of which was the return to Scotland of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1561 after her exile in France), was published in 1813 and was a success. It was, in the guise of a competition, a collection of verse tales, of which ''Kilmeny'' became and remained the best known.  At the end of 1813 he began writing what would later become his well-known poem ''Mador of the Moor''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlix</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 1813 Hogg's mother died. In 1814 he met [[William Wordsworth]] and made a visit to the Lake District to see Wordsworth and other poets. In 1815 the Duke of Buccleuch granted him a small farm at Eltrive Moss, where he could live rent-free for his lifetime. He continued to write songs and poems, including \"The Field of Waterloo\" and \"To the Ancient Banner of Buccleuch\". His poem ''Mador of the Moor'' was published in 1816. Later in the year he published his collection of parodies ''The Poetic Mirror'', achieving a marked success.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlix\u2013l</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg by W. Nicholson.jpg|thumb|James Hogg, detail of an oil painting by W. Nicholson]]\n\nHogg first met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in the aftermath of his own publisher John Goldie's 1814 bankruptcy, and in 1817 he helped with the start of Blackwood's  ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Edinburgh Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 69, 93\u201394</ref> He published his two volume collection ''Dramatic Tales'' in May. In 1818 his collection ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck and Other Tales'' was published by Blackwood. At this time Hogg was busy with his work ''[[Jacobite Relics]]''. In 1819 he proposed marriage to Margaret Phillips. At the end of the year he published the first volume of ''Jacobite Relics''. He married Margaret Phillips on 28 April 1820. His second tales collection ''Winter Evening Tales'' was published a month later. At the end of the year his father died. The second volume of ''Jacobite Relics'' was published in February 1821, and his son James Robert Hogg was born in March 1821. Around this time, Hogg began having serious financial problems.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. li</ref>\n\nIt was through the ''Edinburgh Monthly Magazine'', soon renamed ''Blackwood's Magazine'', that Hogg found fame, although it was not the sort that he wanted. Launched as a counter-blast to the Whig ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', Blackwood wanted punchy content in his new publication. He found his ideal contributors in [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (who wrote as Christopher North) and [[John Gibson Lockhart]] (later Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer). Their first published article, \"The Chaldee Manuscript\", a thinly disguised satire of Edinburgh society in biblical language which Hogg started and Wilson and Lockhart elaborated, was so controversial<ref>Duncan (2004) p. l</ref> that Wilson fled and Blackwood was forced to apologise. Soon Blackwood's Tory views and reviews \u2013 often scurrilous attacks on other writers \u2013 were notorious, and the magazine, or \"Maga\" as it came to be known, had become one of the best-selling journals of its day.\n\nBut Hogg quickly found himself forced out of the inner circle. As other writers such as Walter Maginn and [[Thomas de Quincey]] joined, he became not merely excluded from the lion's share of publication in Maga, but a figure of fun in its pages. Wilson and Lockhart were dangerous friends. Hogg's ''Memoirs of the Author's Life'' were savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer, causing Hogg to temporarily break with ''Blackwood's'', and go to work for Constable's smaller ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan (2004) p. lii</ref>\n\nIn 1822 the ''Maga'' launched the ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'' or \"Nights at Ambrose's\", imaginary conversations in a drinking-den between semi-fictional characters such as North, O'Doherty, The Opium Eater and the Ettrick Shepherd. The Shepherd was Hogg.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/> The ''Noctes'' continued until 1834, and were written after 1825 mostly by Wilson, although other writers, including Hogg himself, had a hand in them. The Shepherd of the ''Noctes'' is a part-animal, part-rural simpleton, and part-savant. He became one of the best-known figures in topical literary affairs, famous throughout Britain and its colonies. Quite what the real James Hogg made of this is mostly unknown, although some of his letters to Blackwood and others express outrage and anguish.\n\nHogg's ''Poetical Works'' in four volumes were published in 1822, as was his novel ''The Three Perils of Man''. In 1823, in debt to Blackwood, Hogg began publishing his work the ''Shepherd's Calendar'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Hogg's daughter Jessie was born in April, and later in the year he published his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman''. In June 1824 he published his best known work, the novel ''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''. His epic poem ''Queen Hynde'' was published at the end of the year. In 1825 he found a new and lucrative market for his works as he began publishing in a literary annual called the ''Literary Souvenir''.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/>\n\nIn 1825 Hogg's daughter Maggie was born, and he began writing a new prose work, later titled ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose''.  In 1826 Hogg was in serious trouble with his debts, while the firm of Constable collapsed, involving Walter Scott and Hogg's friend John Aiken. In 1827 his debts began to lighten as his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' pieces were being published, and he was getting more and more applications to contribute to annuals. The death of his father-in-law, whose family Hogg had been supporting, gave him relief. His third daughter Harriet was born at the end of the year. Hogg's collection ''Select and Rare Scottish Melodies'' was published in 1828, and he continued to write songs and contribute to annuals throughout 1828\u201329, while his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' was published in book form in Spring, 1829.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liii</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Ettrick Parish Church - geograph.org.uk - 902352.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ettrick Parish Church, where Hogg is buried]]\n[[File:James Hogg as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|240px|James Hogg as depicted on the [[Scott Monument]]]]\nIn 1830 he started publishing in the new ''Fraser's Magazine'', and at the end of the year he met with Walter Scott for the last time. In early 1831 Hogg's ''Songs by the Ettrick Shepherd'' was published, but the publishing of the companion volume ''A Queer Book'' was held up by Blackwood. Hogg's last child, his daughter Mary, was born in August. At the end of the year he quarrelled with Blackwood, and decided to publish his works in [[London]]. In 1832 his ''Altrive Tales'' was published in London, while Blackwood finally published ''A Queer Book'' in April. Hogg was offered a large sum to edit a collection of the works of Robert Burns, but the bankruptcy of his London publisher stopped the publication of his ''Altrive Tales''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liv</ref>\n\nIn 1833 Hogg had an accident while [[curling]], falling through the ice, causing a serious illness. In 1834 his biographical work ''Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott'' was published in the United States, while a pirated version published in Edinburgh led to a break with Lockhart. Hogg mended his relationship with Blackwood in May, but Blackwood died at the end of the year. Hogg published ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose'' at the beginning of 1835.\n\n===Death===\n\nJames Hogg died on 21 November 1835 and was buried in Ettrick Churchyard, close to his childhood home.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. lv</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg death mask.JPG|thumb|140px|Hogg's death mask on display in [[Selkirk, Scotland|Selkirk]]]]\n[[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] 1835 \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\", written in the year of his death, includes the lines:\n\n<poem>The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,\n'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;\nAnd death upon the braes of Yarrow,\nHas closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes.</poem> \n\nThis [[eulogy]] notwithstanding, Wordsworth's notes state \"He was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.\"<ref>Wordsworth, William (1835) [http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519184531/http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html |date=19 May 2009 }} Virginia University.

He was considered a man of great natural genius whose uncouth style and subject-matter, so natural for the clownish figure depicted in the ''Noctes Ambrosianae'', should not be held against him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anecdotes of Scott |first=James |last=Hogg |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn= 0-7486-2085-0 |pages=v\u2013vi }}</ref> A collected edition of his works was published in the 1830s, after Hogg's death, pruned of some passages which offended the increasing delicacy of the age, and another ''Works of the Ettrick Shepherd'' was prepared in the 1860s which took the process even further; some works, for example ''The Three Perils of Woman'', were excluded altogether.

Growing interest in ''The Confessions'' led to the rediscovery and reconsideration of his other work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Now his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman'' is also considered a classic and all his work, including his letters, is undergoing major publication in the Stirling/South Carolina editions.  However, ''Justified Sinner'' remains his most important work and is now seen as one of the major Scottish novels of its time, and absolutely crucial in terms of exploring one of the key themes of [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and identity: [[Calvinism]].  In a 2006 interview with [[Melvyn Bragg]] for [[ITV1]], Scottish novelist [[Irvine Welsh]] cited Hogg, especially ''The Confessions'' as a major influence on his writing.

As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], of whom he later wrote an [[unauthorized biography]]. He became widely known as the \"'''Ettrick Shepherd'''\", a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'', published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. He is best known today for his novel ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]''. His other works include the long poem ''The Queen's Wake'' (1813), his collection of songs ''[[Jacobite Relics]]'' (1819), and his two novels ''[[The Three Perils of Man]]'' (1822), and ''[[The Three Perils of Woman]]'' (1823).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJames Hogg was born on a small farm near [[Ettrick, Scotland]] in 1770 and was [[baptized]] there on 9 December, his actual date of birth having never been recorded.<ref name=\"literary\">{{Cite web| last=Hughes | first=Gillian | title=James Hogg | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2168 | date=5 November 2001 | publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia | accessdate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> His father, Robert Hogg (1729\u20131820), was a tenant farmer while his mother, Margaret Hogg (n\u00e9e Laidlaw) (1730\u20131813), was noted for collecting native Scottish [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"literary\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Cite web | last=Gilbert | first=Suzanne | title=Hogg, Traditional Culture, and The Mountain Bard | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | date=19 May 2006 | publisher=University of Stirling | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212803/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Margaret Laidlaw's father, known as Will o' Phawhope, was said to have been the last man in the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Border country]] to speak with the [[Fairy|fairies]].<ref name=\"Buchan\">{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |page=62 }}</ref> James was the second eldest of four brothers, his siblings being William, David, and Robert (from eldest to youngest).<ref name=\"stirling\">{{Cite web | title=Sketch of the Life of the Ettrick Shepherd | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212825/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Robert and David later emigrated to the United States, while James and William remained in Scotland for their entire lives.<ref name=\"stirling\"/>\n\nJames attended a parish school for a few months before his education was stopped due to his father's bankruptcy as a stock-farmer and sheep-dealer. Robert Hogg was then given the position of shepherd at Ettrickhouse farm by one of his neighbours. James worked as a farm servant throughout his childhood, tending cows, doing general farm work, and acting as a shepherd's assistant. His early experiences of literature and story telling came from the Bible and his mother's and uncle's stories.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlvi</ref> In 1784 he purchased a fiddle with money that he had saved, and taught himself how to play it. In 1785 he served a year working for a tenant farmer at Singlee. In 1786 he went to work for Mr. Laidlaw of Ellibank, staying with him for eighteen months. In 1788 he was given his first job as a shepherd by Laidlaw's father, a farmer at Willenslee.

Hogg later said that Laidlaw was more like a father to him than an employer. Seeing how hard he was working to improve himself, Laidlaw offered to help by making books available for Hogg from his own library, and through a local lending library. Hogg also began composing songs to be sung by local girls. He became a lifelong friend of his master's son, William Laidlaw, himself a minor writer and later the [[amanuensis]] of Walter Scott. It was at this time that Hogg, his eldest brother, and several cousins, formed a literary society of shepherds.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlvii</ref>\n\nHogg first became familiar with the work of the recently deceased [[Robert Burns]] in 1797, after having the poem ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'' read to him. During this period Hogg wrote plays and pastorals, and continued producing songs. His work as a sheep drover stimulated an interest in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In 1800 he left Blackhouse to help take care of his parents at Ettrickhouse. His collection ''Scottish Pastorals'' was published early in 1801 to favourable reviews. His patriotic song \"Donald Macdonald\" also achieved popularity.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1801 Hogg was recruited to collect ballads for [[Walter Scott]]'s collection ''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''.

At the end of 1809 he began an affair with Elizabeth Beattie, and soon after absconded from his creditors, returning in disgrace to Ettrick.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\"/>\n\nIn 1810 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] to start a literary career. In March 1810 his daughter by Elizabeth Beattie was born, christened Elizabeth Hogg in June. At the end of 1810 he met his future wife Margaret Phillips. His magazine ''[[The Spy (periodical by James Hogg)|The Spy]]'', begun in 1810, ended after a year. At this time he became a member of a debate society called ''The Forum'', eventually serving as its secretary. In 1812 he started planning a long poetical work. ''The Queen's Wake'' (the setting of which was the return to Scotland of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1561 after her exile in France), was published in 1813 and was a success. It was, in the guise of a competition, a collection of verse tales, of which ''Kilmeny'' became and remained the best known.  At the end of 1813 he began writing what would later become his well-known poem ''Mador of the Moor''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlix</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 1813 Hogg's mother died. In 1814 he met [[William Wordsworth]] and made a visit to the Lake District to see Wordsworth and other poets. In 1815 the Duke of Buccleuch granted him a small farm at Eltrive Moss, where he could live rent-free for his lifetime. He continued to write songs and poems, including \"The Field of Waterloo\" and \"To the Ancient Banner of Buccleuch\". His poem ''Mador of the Moor'' was published in 1816. Later in the year he published his collection of parodies ''The Poetic Mirror'', achieving a marked success.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlix\u2013l</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg by W. Nicholson.jpg|thumb|James Hogg, detail of an oil painting by W. Nicholson]]\n\nHogg first met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in the aftermath of his own publisher John Goldie's 1814 bankruptcy, and in 1817 he helped with the start of Blackwood's  ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Edinburgh Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 69, 93\u201394</ref> He published his two volume collection ''Dramatic Tales'' in May. In 1818 his collection ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck and Other Tales'' was published by Blackwood. At this time Hogg was busy with his work ''[[Jacobite Relics]]''. In 1819 he proposed marriage to Margaret Phillips. At the end of the year he published the first volume of ''Jacobite Relics''. He married Margaret Phillips on 28 April 1820. His second tales collection ''Winter Evening Tales'' was published a month later. At the end of the year his father died. The second volume of ''Jacobite Relics'' was published in February 1821, and his son James Robert Hogg was born in March 1821. Around this time, Hogg began having serious financial problems.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. li</ref>\n\nIt was through the ''Edinburgh Monthly Magazine'', soon renamed ''Blackwood's Magazine'', that Hogg found fame, although it was not the sort that he wanted. Launched as a counter-blast to the Whig ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', Blackwood wanted punchy content in his new publication. He found his ideal contributors in [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (who wrote as Christopher North) and [[John Gibson Lockhart]] (later Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer). Their first published article, \"The Chaldee Manuscript\", a thinly disguised satire of Edinburgh society in biblical language which Hogg started and Wilson and Lockhart elaborated, was so controversial<ref>Duncan (2004) p. l</ref> that Wilson fled and Blackwood was forced to apologise. Soon Blackwood's Tory views and reviews \u2013 often scurrilous attacks on other writers \u2013 were notorious, and the magazine, or \"Maga\" as it came to be known, had become one of the best-selling journals of its day.\n\nBut Hogg quickly found himself forced out of the inner circle. As other writers such as Walter Maginn and [[Thomas de Quincey]] joined, he became not merely excluded from the lion's share of publication in Maga, but a figure of fun in its pages. Wilson and Lockhart were dangerous friends. Hogg's ''Memoirs of the Author's Life'' were savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer, causing Hogg to temporarily break with ''Blackwood's'', and go to work for Constable's smaller ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan (2004) p. lii</ref>\n\nIn 1822 the ''Maga'' launched the ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'' or \"Nights at Ambrose's\", imaginary conversations in a drinking-den between semi-fictional characters such as North, O'Doherty, The Opium Eater and the Ettrick Shepherd. The Shepherd was Hogg.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/> The ''Noctes'' continued until 1834, and were written after 1825 mostly by Wilson, although other writers, including Hogg himself, had a hand in them. The Shepherd of the ''Noctes'' is a part-animal, part-rural simpleton, and part-savant. He became one of the best-known figures in topical literary affairs, famous throughout Britain and its colonies. Quite what the real James Hogg made of this is mostly unknown, although some of his letters to Blackwood and others express outrage and anguish.\n\nHogg's ''Poetical Works'' in four volumes were published in 1822, as was his novel ''The Three Perils of Man''. In 1823, in debt to Blackwood, Hogg began publishing his work the ''Shepherd's Calendar'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Hogg's daughter Jessie was born in April, and later in the year he published his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman''. In June 1824 he published his best known work, the novel ''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''. His epic poem ''Queen Hynde'' was published at the end of the year. In 1825 he found a new and lucrative market for his works as he began publishing in a literary annual called the ''Literary Souvenir''.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/>\n\nIn 1825 Hogg's daughter Maggie was born, and he began writing a new prose work, later titled ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose''.  In 1826 Hogg was in serious trouble with his debts, while the firm of Constable collapsed, involving Walter Scott and Hogg's friend John Aiken. In 1827 his debts began to lighten as his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' pieces were being published, and he was getting more and more applications to contribute to annuals. The death of his father-in-law, whose family Hogg had been supporting, gave him relief. His third daughter Harriet was born at the end of the year. Hogg's collection ''Select and Rare Scottish Melodies'' was published in 1828, and he continued to write songs and contribute to annuals throughout 1828\u201329, while his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' was published in book form in Spring, 1829.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liii</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Ettrick Parish Church - geograph.org.uk - 902352.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ettrick Parish Church, where Hogg is buried]]\n[[File:James Hogg as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|240px|James Hogg as depicted on the [[Scott Monument]]]]\nIn 1830 he started publishing in the new ''Fraser's Magazine'', and at the end of the year he met with Walter Scott for the last time. In early 1831 Hogg's ''Songs by the Ettrick Shepherd'' was published, but the publishing of the companion volume ''A Queer Book'' was held up by Blackwood. Hogg's last child, his daughter Mary, was born in August. At the end of the year he quarrelled with Blackwood, and decided to publish his works in [[London]]. In 1832 his ''Altrive Tales'' was published in London, while Blackwood finally published ''A Queer Book'' in April. Hogg was offered a large sum to edit a collection of the works of Robert Burns, but the bankruptcy of his London publisher stopped the publication of his ''Altrive Tales''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liv</ref>\n\nIn 1833 Hogg had an accident while [[curling]], falling through the ice, causing a serious illness. In 1834 his biographical work ''Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott'' was published in the United States, while a pirated version published in Edinburgh led to a break with Lockhart. Hogg mended his relationship with Blackwood in May, but Blackwood died at the end of the year. Hogg published ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose'' at the beginning of 1835.\n\n===Death===\n\nJames Hogg died on 21 November 1835 and was buried in Ettrick Churchyard, close to his childhood home.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. lv</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg death mask.JPG|thumb|140px|Hogg's death mask on display in [[Selkirk, Scotland|Selkirk]]]]\n[[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] 1835 \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\", written in the year of his death, includes the lines:\n\n<poem>The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,\n'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;\nAnd death upon the braes of Yarrow,\nHas closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes.</poem> \n\nThis [[eulogy]] notwithstanding, Wordsworth's notes state \"He was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.\"<ref>Wordsworth, William (1835) [http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519184531/http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html |date=19 May 2009 }} Virginia University.

He was considered a man of great natural genius whose uncouth style and subject-matter, so natural for the clownish figure depicted in the ''Noctes Ambrosianae'', should not be held against him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anecdotes of Scott |first=James |last=Hogg |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn= 0-7486-2085-0 |pages=v\u2013vi }}</ref> A collected edition of his works was published in the 1830s, after Hogg's death, pruned of some passages which offended the increasing delicacy of the age, and another ''Works of the Ettrick Shepherd'' was prepared in the 1860s which took the process even further; some works, for example ''The Three Perils of Woman'', were excluded altogether.  Victorian readers of these emasculated texts naturally came to the conclusion that Hogg had been overrated, and that he was notable mainly as an example of triumph over adverse circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anecdotes of Scott |first=James |last=Hogg |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn= 0-7486-2085-0 |page=vi }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13470 | year=2004 | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=19 March 2012 | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/13470 | last1=Mack | first1=Douglas S. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature | url=http://www.bartleby.com/221/1026.html | date=1907\u20131921| publisher=Bartleby | accessdate=19 March 2012 }}</ref> Apart from ''Justified Sinner'', which even his detractors acknowledged as unusually powerful (and often attributed to someone else, usually Lockhart), his novels were regarded as turgid, his verse as light, his short tales and articles as ephemera.\n[[File:Monument to James Hogg - geograph.org.uk - 1524995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|James Hogg monument at [[St Mary's Loch]] by [[Andrew Currie (sculptor)|Andrew Currie]]]]\nThis situation only began to change in 1924, when the French writer [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] was loaned ''Justified Sinner'' by [[Raymond Mortimer]].

Growing interest in ''The Confessions'' led to the rediscovery and reconsideration of his other work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Now his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman'' is also considered a classic and all his work, including his letters, is undergoing major publication in the Stirling/South Carolina editions.  However, ''Justified Sinner'' remains his most important work and is now seen as one of the major Scottish novels of its time, and absolutely crucial in terms of exploring one of the key themes of [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and identity: [[Calvinism]].  In a 2006 interview with [[Melvyn Bragg]] for [[ITV1]], Scottish novelist [[Irvine Welsh]] cited Hogg, especially ''The Confessions'' as a major influence on his writing.  A James Hogg Society was founded in 1981 to encourage the study of his life and writings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=The James Hogg Society | url=http://www.english.stir.ac.uk/research/profile/hogg-society/jameshogghome-page.php | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=19 March 2012 }}</ref> Hogg's story \"The Brownie of the Black Haggs\" was dramatised for BBC radio 4 in 2003 by Scottish playwright Marty Ross as part of his \"Darker Side of the Border\" series.

Due to the cruelty of her crimes, which shocked the Taiwanese population, she was nicknamed '''The Nantou Poisoning Wife''' and '''The Puli Poisoning Wife'''.\n\n== Case history ==\nOriginally from [[Tainan]], Yuru worked at a former [[vocational school]]-turned-cabaret club. Because of her beautiful appearance, she generated a great income, but became addicted to gambling at [[Mark Six]] lotteries, struggling to make ends meet. Soon after, she fell in love with a drunkard named Liu Yuhang, a national [[badminton]] player, to whom she married. The family operated a small, but honest [[stinky tofu]] stand in Puli. However, when Lin got pregnant, Liu decided against his own's family pleas and married another woman. However, despite her divorce, Yuru continued to bet at Mark Six, continuing to accumulate large gambling debts, to the point where she borrowed money from underground banks amassing $20 million [[New Taiwan dollar|NT]]. Since she couldn't pay off her debts, she devised a plan to defraud insurance money through murder.\n\nOn August 16, 2008, under the threat of suspending the operations of the stinky tofu stand because of her unstable income, Lin burned the establishment down during the night by dousing it with [[kerosene]] and lighting it up.\n\nOn November 10th, while visiting her family in Tainan, Yuru pushed her mother Hou Yueyun down the stairs. Yueyun suffered a serious head injury and perished, with Lin receiving $5 million NT in insurance claims.\n\nIn May 2009, Lin searched on the internet for a way to poison her mother-in-law, Zheng Huishen. She first administered it into Zheng's food, after which the woman was driven to the hospital. There, Yuru tampered with the [[IV drip]] by mixing it with [[Antidepressant|antidepressants]], [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]]. The deadly concoction successfully poisoned her victim.\n\nBetween June and July, Lin tried to kill her ex-husband in the same way. She first poisoned his food, because of which Liu was admitted to the hospital. However, when she tried to put the poison in the IV drip, she was discovered by a nurse. After the nurse stopped her, she inquired Yuru as to her reasoning. Lin argued that she had just felt that the drip wasn't smooth enough and wanted to pass the bottle. However, the nurses were alert and took special care of Yuhang, discarding the poisoned \"drip bottle\". Although Liu survived the first time, he was re-admitted soon after because of suspected acute [[gastroenteritis]]. Yuru deliberately chose a single ward this time to prevent interference from the nurses, and successfully managed to kill her ex-husband.\n\nThe insurance company's claimants noted that Yuru's relatives all died in a strangely consecutive manner, so they reported their suspicions to the police. The investigators discovered that Lin had also insured her aunt and son, whom she likely had intended to kill as well. In addition, the poisoned drip bottle retained by the nurses was regarded as additional proof for the crimes.\n\nAt her trial, Yuru's lawyer argued that, compared to the average 106 IQ in Taiwan, Lin's one of 57, coupled with her depression, should be considered an [[intellectual disability]] and thus, prevent the issue of the death penalty. But the presiding judge rebuked this, pointing out that she had a vocational education, had signed a long-term bet with the lottery, had setup a plan and carried out the killings of her relatives in a calculated manner.

On June 14, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]] sentenced her to death, making Yuru the fourth female [[death row]] prisoner in the country.<ref>[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20130614/35083960/applesearch/\u6bba\u6bcd\u6bba\u5a46\u6bba\u592b\u9b54\u5973\u5224\u6b7b Sentence for the Mother Killing Wife]  Apple Daily</ref> She is currently detained in the Taichung Women's Prison, awaiting execution. Due to the cruelty of her crimes, which shocked the Taiwanese population, she was nicknamed '''The Nantou Poisoning Wife''' and '''The Puli Poisoning Wife'''.\n\n== Case history ==\nOriginally from [[Tainan]], Yuru worked at a former [[vocational school]]-turned-cabaret club. Because of her beautiful appearance, she generated a great income, but became addicted to gambling at [[Mark Six]] lotteries, struggling to make ends meet. Soon after, she fell in love with a drunkard named Liu Yuhang, a national [[badminton]] player, to whom she married. The family operated a small, but honest [[stinky tofu]] stand in Puli. However, when Lin got pregnant, Liu decided against his own's family pleas and married another woman. However, despite her divorce, Yuru continued to bet at Mark Six, continuing to accumulate large gambling debts, to the point where she borrowed money from underground banks amassing $20 million [[New Taiwan dollar|NT]]. Since she couldn't pay off her debts, she devised a plan to defraud insurance money through murder.\n\nOn August 16, 2008, under the threat of suspending the operations of the stinky tofu stand because of her unstable income, Lin burned the establishment down during the night by dousing it with [[kerosene]] and lighting it up.\n\nOn November 10th, while visiting her family in Tainan, Yuru pushed her mother Hou Yueyun down the stairs. Yueyun suffered a serious head injury and perished, with Lin receiving $5 million NT in insurance claims.\n\nIn May 2009, Lin searched on the internet for a way to poison her mother-in-law, Zheng Huishen. She first administered it into Zheng's food, after which the woman was driven to the hospital. There, Yuru tampered with the [[IV drip]] by mixing it with [[Antidepressant|antidepressants]], [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]]. The deadly concoction successfully poisoned her victim.\n\nBetween June and July, Lin tried to kill her ex-husband in the same way. She first poisoned his food, because of which Liu was admitted to the hospital. However, when she tried to put the poison in the IV drip, she was discovered by a nurse. After the nurse stopped her, she inquired Yuru as to her reasoning. Lin argued that she had just felt that the drip wasn't smooth enough and wanted to pass the bottle. However, the nurses were alert and took special care of Yuhang, discarding the poisoned \"drip bottle\". Although Liu survived the first time, he was re-admitted soon after because of suspected acute [[gastroenteritis]]. Yuru deliberately chose a single ward this time to prevent interference from the nurses, and successfully managed to kill her ex-husband.\n\nThe insurance company's claimants noted that Yuru's relatives all died in a strangely consecutive manner, so they reported their suspicions to the police. The investigators discovered that Lin had also insured her aunt and son, whom she likely had intended to kill as well. In addition, the poisoned drip bottle retained by the nurses was regarded as additional proof for the crimes.\n\nAt her trial, Yuru's lawyer argued that, compared to the average 106 IQ in Taiwan, Lin's one of 57, coupled with her depression, should be considered an [[intellectual disability]] and thus, prevent the issue of the death penalty. But the presiding judge rebuked this, pointing out that she had a vocational education, had signed a long-term bet with the lottery, had setup a plan and carried out the killings of her relatives in a calculated manner. Because of this, the death sentence was retained.\n\n== Prosecution and trial ==\n\n* In April 2010, Lin Yuru was handed three death sentences by the Nantou District Procuratore.<ref>[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20100408/32420230/applesearch/\u8a50\u9818\u4fdd\u96aa\u91d19\u500b\u6708\u6bba3\u4eba\u9b54\u5973\u6c42\u86553\u6b7b\u5211 Fraudulent witch's claims kills 3 people in 9 months, begging for death penalty]\n\n[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20100408/32420230/applesearch/\u8a50\u9818\u4fdd\u96aa\u91d19\u500b\u6708\u6bba3\u4eba\u9b54\u5973\u6c42\u86553\u6b7b\u5211\u906d\u6c42\u8655\u6b7b\u5211 Fraudulent witch's claims kills 3 people in 9 months, sentenced to death] by Apple Daily</ref>\n* On May 20, 2011, the Nantou District Court approved of the death sentences in a combined trial, but in February 2012, when an appeal was filed to the second instance, the Taichung High Court commuted the sentence to [[life imprisonment]].<ref>[http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/local/20120207/109206/applesearch/\u300c\u77ef\u5316\u70ba\u91cd\u300d 'Weightened' - witch who killed 3 people escapes death] by Apple Daily</ref>\n* Upon a retrial, the sentence was reverted back to the death penalty, and was ultimately confirmed by the Supreme Court on June 14, 2013.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of serial killers by country]]\n==External links==\n* [https://murderpedia.org/female.Y/y/yuru-lin.htm Murderpedia article]\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lin, Yuru}}\n[[Category:1982 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century criminals]]\n[[Category:Female serial killers]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese serial killers]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Insurance fraud]]\n[[Category:Poisoners]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese criminals]]\n[[Category:People from Tainan]]\n", "name_user": "Lopifalko", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:SECTIONORDER", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yuru_(criminal)"}
