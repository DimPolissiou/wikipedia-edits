In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the  \u201chairy layer.\u201d The hairy layer consists of \u03ba-casein, which are strings of [[polypeptide]]s that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shukla|first1=Anuj|last2=Narayanan|first2=Theyencheri|last3=Zanchi|first3=Drazen|title=Structure of casein micelles and their complexation with tannins|journal=Soft Matter|date=2009|volume=5|issue=15|page=2884|url=http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2009/scm/scm02|accessdate=17 December 2017|doi=10.1039/b903103k|bibcode=2009SMat....5.2884S}}</ref>  The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the [[entropy]] of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the [[enzyme]], rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the \u03ba-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese.\n[[File:2015-01-25 Jersey Blue - St\u00e4dtch\u00e4si Lichtensteig - der Schweizer - hu - 8005.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Characteristic blue veins in blue cheese.]]\n\n=== Mold growth  ===\n''Penicillium roqueforti'' and ''Penicillium glaucum'' are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow. Therefore, initial fermentation of the cheese is done by [[lactic acid bacteria]].

In fact, one type of bacteria in blue cheese, Brevibacterium linens, is the same bacteria responsible for foot and body odor.

In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the  \u201chairy layer.\u201d The hairy layer consists of \u03ba-casein, which are strings of [[polypeptide]]s that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shukla|first1=Anuj|last2=Narayanan|first2=Theyencheri|last3=Zanchi|first3=Drazen|title=Structure of casein micelles and their complexation with tannins|journal=Soft Matter|date=2009|volume=5|issue=15|page=2884|url=http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2009/scm/scm02|accessdate=17 December 2017|doi=10.1039/b903103k|bibcode=2009SMat....5.2884S}}</ref>  The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the [[entropy]] of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the [[enzyme]], rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the \u03ba-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese.\n[[File:2015-01-25 Jersey Blue - St\u00e4dtch\u00e4si Lichtensteig - der Schweizer - hu - 8005.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Characteristic blue veins in blue cheese.]]\n\n=== Mold growth  ===\n''Penicillium roqueforti'' and ''Penicillium glaucum'' are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow.

(1979) ''Insects Feeding on California Oak Trees''in ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources'', Timothy Plum and Norman Pillsbury (eds.).</ref>\n\nAcorns are attractive to animals because they are large and thus efficiently consumed or cached. Acorns are also rich in nutrients. Percentages vary from species to species, but all acorns contain large amounts of [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s, as well as the minerals [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]] and [[potassium]], and the [[vitamin]] [[niacin]]. Total [[food energy]] in an acorn also varies by species, but all compare well with other wild foods and with other nuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s02dn.html |title=Nutrition Facts for Acorn Flour |publisher=Nutritiondata.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}</ref>\n\nAcorns also contain bitter [[tannin]]s, the amount varying with the species. Since tannins, which are plant [[polyphenol]]s, interfere with an animal's ability to [[metabolize]] protein, creatures must adapt in different ways to use the nutritional value acorns contain. Animals may preferentially select acorns that contain fewer tannins. When the tannins are metabolized in cattle, the tannic acid produced can cause [[ulceration]] and [[kidney]] failure.<ref name=\"Barringer\"/>\n\nAnimals that [[cache (biology)|cache]] acorns, such as jays and squirrels, may wait to consume some of these acorns until sufficient groundwater has [[percolate]]d through them to [[Leaching (chemical science)|leach]] out the tannins. Other animals buffer their acorn diet with other foods. Many insects, birds, and mammals metabolize tannins with fewer ill effects than do humans.\n\nSpecies of acorn that contain large amounts of tannins are very bitter, [[astringent]], and potentially irritating if eaten raw. This is particularly true of the acorns of American [[Quercus rubra|red oaks]] and [[Pedunculate oak|English oaks]]. The acorns of [[white oak]]s, being much lower in tannins, are nutty in flavor; this characteristic is enhanced if the acorns are given a light roast before grinding.\n\nTannins can be removed by soaking chopped acorns in several changes of water, until the water no longer turns brown. Cold water leaching can take several days, but three to four changes of boiling water can leach the tannins in under an hour.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A practical guide to edible & useful plants : including recipes, harmful plants, natural dyes & textile fibers|last=1950-|first=Tull, Delena|date=1987|publisher=Texas Monthly Press|isbn=9780877190226|location=Austin, Tex.|oclc=15015652}}</ref> Hot water leaching (boiling) cooks the starch of the acorn, which would otherwise act like gluten in flour, helping it bind to itself.

Acorns are also sometimes prepared as a massage oil.\n\nAcorns of the white oak group, ''Leucobalanus'', typically start rooting as soon as they are in contact with the soil (in the fall), then send up the leaf shoot in the spring.\n\n===Dispersal agents===\n[[File:Quercus robur - sprouting acorn.jpg|thumb|left|Sprouting acorn of ''[[Quercus robur]]''.]]\n\nAcorns are too heavy for [[wind dispersal]], so they require other ways to spread. Oaks therefore depend on [[Biological dispersal|biological seed dispersal]] agents to move the acorns beyond the mother tree and into a suitable area for germination (including access to adequate water, sunlight and soil nutrients), ideally a minimum of {{convert|20\u201330|m|abbr=on}} from the parent tree{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\nMany animals eat unripe acorns on the tree or ripe acorns from the ground, with no reproductive benefit to the oak, but some animals, such as [[squirrels]] and [[jays]] serve as seed dispersal agents. Jays and squirrels that scatter-hoard acorns in caches for future use effectively plant acorns in a variety of locations in which it is possible for them to germinate and thrive.\n\nEven though jays and squirrels retain remarkably large mental maps of cache locations and return to consume them, the odd acorn may be lost, or a jay or squirrel may die before consuming all of its stores. A small number of acorns manage to germinate and survive, producing the next generation of oaks.\n\nScatter-hoarding behavior depends on jays and squirrels associating with plants that provide good packets of food that are nutritionally valuable, but not too big for the dispersal agent to handle. The beak sizes of jays determine how large acorns may get before jays ignore them.\n\nAcorns germinate on different schedules, depending on their place in the oak family. Once acorns sprout, they are less nutritious, as the seed tissue converts to the indigestible [[lignin]]s that form the root.<ref>{{citation|last=Janzen|first= Daniel H. |year=1971|title=Seed Predation by Animals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|editor=Richard F.

In years that oaks produced many acorns, Native Americans sometimes collected enough acorns to store for two years as insurance against poor acorn production years.\n\nAfter drying them in the sun to discourage [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[germination]], women took acorns back to their villages and cached them in hollow trees or structures on poles, to keep them safe from mice and squirrels. The stored acorns could then be used when needed, particularly during the winter when other resources were scarce. Those acorns that germinated in the fall were shelled and pulverized before those that germinate in spring. Because of their high fat content, stored acorns can become rancid. Molds may also grow on them.\n\nThe lighting of ground fires killed the larvae of [[Blastobasis glandulella|acorn moth]]s and [[acorn weevil]]s by burning them during their dormancy period in the soil.  The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFires also released the nutrients bound in dead leaves and other plant debris into the soil, thus fertilizing oak trees while clearing the ground to make acorn collection easier. Most North American oaks tolerate light fires, especially when consistent burning has eliminated woody fuel accumulation around their trunks. Consistent burning encouraged oak growth at the expense of other trees less tolerant of fire, thus keeping oaks dominant in the landscapes. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nOaks produce more acorns when they are not too close to other oaks and thus competing with them for sunlight, water and soil nutrients. The fires tended to eliminate the more vulnerable young oaks and leave old oaks which created open [[oak savanna]]s with trees ideally spaced to maximize acorn production.\n\n===In culture===\n====Art====\nA [[Motif (art)|motif]] in [[Roman architecture]], also popular in Celtic and Scandinavian art, the acorn symbol is used as an [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] on [[cutlery]], furniture, and jewelry; it also appears on [[finial]]s at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n====Contemporary use as symbol====\nThe acorn is the symbol for the [[National Trails]] of [[England and Wales]], and is used for the [[waymarking|waymarks]] on these paths.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Trail Acorn|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/hadrianswall/publications.asp?PageId=276|work=National Trails|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref> The acorn, specifically that of the white oak, is also present in the symbol for the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Connecticut|url=http://uconn.edu/|accessdate=5 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104073123/http://www.uconn.edu/| archivedate= 4 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAcorns are also used as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] in [[heraldry]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''acorn'' (earlier ''akerne'', and ''acharn'') is related to the [[gothic language|Gothic]] name ''akran'', which had the sense of \"fruit of the unenclosed land\".<ref>{{OEtymD|acorn}}</ref> The word was applied to the most important forest produce, that of the oak.

Acorns are also rich in nutrients. Percentages vary from species to species, but all acorns contain large amounts of [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s, as well as the minerals [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]] and [[potassium]], and the [[vitamin]] [[niacin]]. Total [[food energy]] in an acorn also varies by species, but all compare well with other wild foods and with other nuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s02dn.html |title=Nutrition Facts for Acorn Flour |publisher=Nutritiondata.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}</ref>\n\nAcorns also contain bitter [[tannin]]s, the amount varying with the species. Since tannins, which are plant [[polyphenol]]s, interfere with an animal's ability to [[metabolize]] protein, creatures must adapt in different ways to use the nutritional value acorns contain. Animals may preferentially select acorns that contain fewer tannins. When the tannins are metabolized in cattle, the tannic acid produced can cause [[ulceration]] and [[kidney]] failure.<ref name=\"Barringer\"/>\n\nAnimals that [[cache (biology)|cache]] acorns, such as jays and squirrels, may wait to consume some of these acorns until sufficient groundwater has [[percolate]]d through them to [[Leaching (chemical science)|leach]] out the tannins. Other animals buffer their acorn diet with other foods. Many insects, birds, and mammals metabolize tannins with fewer ill effects than do humans.\n\nSpecies of acorn that contain large amounts of tannins are very bitter, [[astringent]], and potentially irritating if eaten raw. This is particularly true of the acorns of American [[Quercus rubra|red oaks]] and [[Pedunculate oak|English oaks]]. The acorns of [[white oak]]s, being much lower in tannins, are nutty in flavor; this characteristic is enhanced if the acorns are given a light roast before grinding.\n\nTannins can be removed by soaking chopped acorns in several changes of water, until the water no longer turns brown. Cold water leaching can take several days, but three to four changes of boiling water can leach the tannins in under an hour.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A practical guide to edible & useful plants : including recipes, harmful plants, natural dyes & textile fibers|last=1950-|first=Tull, Delena|date=1987|publisher=Texas Monthly Press|isbn=9780877190226|location=Austin, Tex.|oclc=15015652}}</ref> Hot water leaching (boiling) cooks the starch of the acorn, which would otherwise act like gluten in flour, helping it bind to itself.

Acorns are also sometimes prepared as a massage oil.\n\nAcorns of the white oak group, ''Leucobalanus'', typically start rooting as soon as they are in contact with the soil (in the fall), then send up the leaf shoot in the spring.\n\n===Dispersal agents===\n[[File:Quercus robur - sprouting acorn.jpg|thumb|left|Sprouting acorn of ''[[Quercus robur]]''.]]\n\nAcorns are too heavy for [[wind dispersal]], so they require other ways to spread. Oaks therefore depend on [[Biological dispersal|biological seed dispersal]] agents to move the acorns beyond the mother tree and into a suitable area for germination (including access to adequate water, sunlight and soil nutrients), ideally a minimum of {{convert|20\u201330|m|abbr=on}} from the parent tree{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\nMany animals eat unripe acorns on the tree or ripe acorns from the ground, with no reproductive benefit to the oak, but some animals, such as [[squirrels]] and [[jays]] serve as seed dispersal agents. Jays and squirrels that scatter-hoard acorns in caches for future use effectively plant acorns in a variety of locations in which it is possible for them to germinate and thrive.\n\nEven though jays and squirrels retain remarkably large mental maps of cache locations and return to consume them, the odd acorn may be lost, or a jay or squirrel may die before consuming all of its stores. A small number of acorns manage to germinate and survive, producing the next generation of oaks.\n\nScatter-hoarding behavior depends on jays and squirrels associating with plants that provide good packets of food that are nutritionally valuable, but not too big for the dispersal agent to handle. The beak sizes of jays determine how large acorns may get before jays ignore them.\n\nAcorns germinate on different schedules, depending on their place in the oak family. Once acorns sprout, they are less nutritious, as the seed tissue converts to the indigestible [[lignin]]s that form the root.<ref>{{citation|last=Janzen|first= Daniel H. |year=1971|title=Seed Predation by Animals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|editor=Richard F.

In years that oaks produced many acorns, Native Americans sometimes collected enough acorns to store for two years as insurance against poor acorn production years.\n\nAfter drying them in the sun to discourage [[mold]] and [[germination]], women took acorns back to their villages and cached them in hollow trees or structures on poles, to keep them safe from mice and squirrels. The stored acorns could then be used when needed, particularly during the winter when other resources were scarce. Those acorns that germinated in the fall were shelled and pulverized before those that germinate in spring. Because of their high fat content, stored acorns can become rancid. Molds may also grow on them.\n\nThe lighting of ground fires killed the larvae of [[Blastobasis glandulella|acorn moth]]s and [[acorn weevil]]s by burning them during their dormancy period in the soil.  The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFires also released the nutrients bound in dead leaves and other plant debris into the soil, thus fertilizing oak trees while clearing the ground to make acorn collection easier. Most North American oaks tolerate light fires, especially when consistent burning has eliminated woody fuel accumulation around their trunks. Consistent burning encouraged oak growth at the expense of other trees less tolerant of fire, thus keeping oaks dominant in the landscapes. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nOaks produce more acorns when they are not too close to other oaks and thus competing with them for sunlight, water and soil nutrients. The fires tended to eliminate the more vulnerable young oaks and leave old oaks which created open [[oak savanna]]s with trees ideally spaced to maximize acorn production.\n\n===In culture===\n====Art====\nA [[Motif (art)|motif]] in [[Roman architecture]], also popular in Celtic and Scandinavian art, the acorn symbol is used as an [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] on [[cutlery]], furniture, and jewelry; it also appears on [[finial]]s at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n====Contemporary use as symbol====\nThe acorn is the symbol for the [[National Trails]] of [[England and Wales]], and is used for the [[waymarking|waymarks]] on these paths.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Trail Acorn|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/hadrianswall/publications.asp?PageId=276|work=National Trails|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref> The acorn, specifically that of the white oak, is also present in the symbol for the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Connecticut|url=http://uconn.edu/|accessdate=5 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104073123/http://www.uconn.edu/| archivedate= 4 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAcorns are also used as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] in [[heraldry]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''acorn'' (earlier ''akerne'', and ''acharn'') is related to the [[gothic language|Gothic]] name ''akran'', which had the sense of \"fruit of the unenclosed land\".<ref>{{OEtymD|acorn}}</ref> The word was applied to the most important forest produce, that of the oak.

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre and [[world city]] of over seven million people, the territory has attracted [[refugees]], immigrants and [[expatriates]] alike searching for a new life.\n\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in [[:Hong Kong]] as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China considers \"[[Unequal treaties|unequal]]\" \u2013 including the ones which ceded the [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the [[Sham Chun River]] and neighbouring islands (i.e. the [[New Territories]]) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming consular assistance or protection under an external treaty) after the [[handover of Hong Kong]].\n\n==Early colonial era==\n[[English common law]] has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, following the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', in the theory that people born within the dominion of [[The Crown]], which included self-governing [[British Dominions|dominions]] and [[Crown colonies]], would have a \"natural allegiance\" to the Crown as a \"debt of gratitude\" to the Crown for protecting them through infancy.  As the dominion of the British Empire expanded, [[British subject]]s included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the rest of the British Empire.\n\nBy this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842 was a British subject. The Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847 expanded what had been covered in the Naturalisation Act 1844, which applied only to people within the United Kingdom, to all its dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing for acquisition of British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a man with British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914===\n{{main|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914}}\nThe British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (now renamed as \"Status of Aliens Act 1914\") came into force on 1 January 1915, codifying for the first time the law relating to British nationality. No major change was introduced but it set into law how people associated with Hong Kong \u2013 as part of \"His Majesty's dominions\" \u2013 would acquire British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality Act 1948===\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations]]' heads of government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenship, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 provided for a new status of [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title [[Commonwealth citizen]].\n\nThe Act came into force on 1 January 1949 and stipulated that anyone born in \"United Kingdom or a colony\" on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British subjects on 31 December 1948 were entitled to acquire CUKC status by declaration. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958.\n\nBritish Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 and 1965, which mainly fine-tuned special provisions about CUKC status acquisition.\n\n===Commonwealth Immigrants Acts===\nUntil 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] and [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom.\n\nAs such, CUKCs connected with Hong Kong were subject to immigration control after 1962.\n\nFinally, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], the concept of patriality or [[right of abode]] was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.\n\nThese acts shaped an increasingly restrictive immigration policy into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of 1984.\n\n=== British Nationality Act 1981 and British Dependent Territories Citizenship ===\n[[Image:Old-hongkong-bp.jpg|thumb|A [[British passport]] for a BDTC with connection with Hong Kong]]\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1981]] created new categories of British nationality and renamed British colonial territories. After implementation, all British Crown colonies became [[British Dependent Territories]]. The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of nationality on 1 January 1983:\n* [[British Citizen]] (for residents of the UK and the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]])\n* [[British Dependent Territories Citizen]] (BDTC) (for the Crown colonies), and\n* [[British Overseas Citizen]] (BOC) (a class of non-inheritable nationality for those who are unable to become a British Citizen, a BDTC or a national of another country)\n\nThe law stated that those who have CUKC status by connection with Hong Kong and those born in Hong Kong on or after 1983 to a parent settled in Hong Kong are BDTCs. The law also stated that British Citizens or BDTCs by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or the dependent territories concerned unless a parent acquired citizenship otherwise than by descent.\n\n==After the Sino-British Joint Declaration==\n[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|right|100px]]\nNegotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong started in the late 1970s between Britain and China. With the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on 19 December 1984, the future of Hong Kong was set, with China to assume sovereignty of the entire territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.\n\nAt that time, there were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Another 2 million were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. After the handover, they would have lost this status and became solely [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationals]]. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants.\n\n===Creation of the British National (Overseas) status===\n{{Demographics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Main|British National (Overseas)}}\n\nThe [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] created an additional category of [[British nationality law|British nationality]] known as ''[[British National (Overseas)]]'' or ''BN(O)''. This new category was available only to Hong Kong BDTCs, and any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so would be able to acquire the status of BN(O). The status was non-transferable and available only by application, and the deadline to apply was 30 June 1997.\n\n====British Overseas Citizen status for those who are 'otherwise stateless'====\nAny Hong Kong BDTCs who failed to register as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a [[British Overseas Citizen]] under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |title=Article 6(1), ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'' |access-date=18 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990: British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families===\n{{Main|British Nationality Selection Scheme}}\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989]], many people in Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]], which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1990/34/contents|title=British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990}}</ref> Under the Act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]] (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically ceased to be a BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.\n\n===Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996: British citizenship for Hong Kong war wives and widows===\nWomen who had received assurance from the Secretary of State that they would be eligible for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of their husband's war service in the defence of Hong Kong may be registered as British Citizens if they were resident in Hong Kong and had not remarried. There is no requirement for the woman to hold (or have held) any form of British nationality. Women registered as British Citizens under this act acquire British citizenship \"otherwise than by descent\" and thus also their children would be [[British Citizen]]s.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1996/41/contents|title=Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996}}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) without Chinese ancestry===\nAnother special group of solely Hong Kong British nationals were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or children of immigrants from Nepal, India and [[Pakistan]]. After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to China, they would not be accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively [[stateless person|stateless]] \u2013 they would have British nationality and [[permanent residency]] and right of abode in Hong Kong, but no right of abode in the UK, nor a right to claim [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationality]].\n\nThe ethnic minorities petitioned to be granted full British citizenship,<ref>[http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html A Pasage to Nowhere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910112715/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html |date=10 September 2005 }} (Prism Nov 1995) ''accessed 1 Aug 2010''</ref> and were backed by several politicians [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], then the Shadow Home Secretary said <ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 ]{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> in a letter to the then Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that \"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China\". He further stated that a claim that BN(O) status amounts to British nationality \"is pure sophistry\".</ref> and media.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'' also said that \"the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong's residents was shameful\", and \"it was the height of cynicism to hand 6 million people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere.\" The article also stated that the real reason that the new Labour government still refused to give full British citizenship to other BDTCs was because if the UK waited until Hong Kong had been disposed of it \"would be seen as highly cynical\", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|The Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, conceded. (\"Britain's colonial obligations\", 3 July 1997, ''[[The Economist]]'')</ref> The subsequently enacted British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1997/20/contents|title=British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997}}</ref> gives them an entitlement to acquire full British citizenship by making an application to register for that status after 1 July 1997.\n\n===Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: British Overseas Territories Citizen status is not applicable to Hong Kong===\nIn light of the passing of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]], which made provision to substitute the wording of \"British Dependent Territories\" with \"[[British Overseas Territories]]\" in the British Nationality Act 1981 among other new provisions, further clarification was made even though this act did not even apply to Hong Kong. Section 14 of the subsequent Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 stated specifically that a person may not be registered as a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]] (BOTC) by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong.\n\n===Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who do not have another nationality or citizenship===\n{{main|Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009}}\nA small group of Hong Kong ethnic minorities had not been eligible for acquiring British citizenship under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 because they were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong before 4 February 1997 or they were under 18 / 21 years of age, had dual nationality through their parents on or after 4 February 1997, but had lost it upon turning 18/21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-nationality-hong-kong-act-1997-nationality-policy-guidance|title=Registration as a British citizen: British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> These BN(O)s lost their second nationality due to changes in the nationality laws of certain countries and had, therefore, become de facto stateless.

Hong Kong BDTC status ceased to exist and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong was presented at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes ''settled'' in a foreign country ''and'' acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became ''settled'' in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a [[dual nationality|dual national]]), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.\n\nThis is reflected in the position the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] has on Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who were Hong Kong permanent residents immediately before 1 July 1997 and hold non-Chinese nationality or citizenship. Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign consular protection in Hong Kong as long as they do not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/roa/eligible-position-chinese-hold-foreign-passports.html|title=The Position of Residents (including Former Residents) of Chinese Nationality who were Permanent Residents Immediately Before 1 July 1997 and Hold Foreign Passports &#124; Immigration Department|website=www.immd.gov.hk}}</ref>\n\n==Recent groups eligible for a form of British Nationality==\n\n===British citizenship for non-ethnic Chinese which were wrongfully denied===\nIn February 2006, in response to representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>[http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim, 6 December 2004 (Accessed 1 Aug 2010)]</ref> British authorities announced that six hundred British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf|title=British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong wrongly refused}}</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request.\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Indians (new Indian law)===\nRecent changes to India's ''Citizenship Act, 1955'' (see [[Indian nationality law]]) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a BN(O) or BOC parent to automatically acquire BOC status at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf articles 6(2) and 6(3) of the ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'']. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 register for full British citizenship].\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Nepalese (reinterpretation of Nepalese law)===\nRecent clarification of [[Nepal citizenship law]] has meant a number of persons born in Hong Kong who failed to renounce their British nationality before the age of 21 and were previously thought to be citizens of Nepal are in fact solely British. The British Government has recently accepted that certain Nepalese passport holders born in Hong Kong before 30 June 1976 are BOCs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office|title=Foreign & Commonwealth Office|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> and can register for British citizenship if they wish to do so.\n\n===British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who are otherwise stateless===\nThe passage of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 provides a path for British Nationals (Overseas) who had no other citizenship before 19 March 2009 to apply for British citizenship under s.&nbsp;4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. To qualify, they must demonstrate that they had not lost or renounced any other nationalities, through action or inaction, on or after 19 March 2009.\n\n==Future of the British National (Overseas) status: Lord Goldsmith's citizenship review in 2008==\n[[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] discussed the BN(O) issue in his citizenship review in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405223352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-05|title=Wayback Machine|date=5 April 2008|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> He regarded the BN(O) status as \"anomalous\" in the history of British nationality law, but saw no alternative to preserving this status.<ref>\"Nonetheless to remove this status without putting something significant in its place would be seen as the British reneging on their promise to the people of Hong Kong. The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship. It is likely that many would not take this up as the prospects economic and fiscal of moving to the UK are not favourable to those well-established in Hong Kong. However, I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, an international treaty between the two countries; and that to secure Chinese agreement to vary the terms of that treaty would not be possible. On that basis, I see no alternative but to preserve this one anomalous category of citizenship\": Chapter 4, paragraph 12.</ref>\n\nHowever, Goldsmith stated in February 2020:<ref>{{Cite

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre and [[world city]] of over seven million people, the territory has attracted [[refugees]], immigrants and [[expatriates]] alike searching for a new life.\n\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in [[:Hong Kong]] as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China considers \"[[Unequal treaties|unequal]]\" \u2013 including the ones which ceded the [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the [[Sham Chun River]] and neighbouring islands (i.e. the [[New Territories]]) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming consular assistance or protection under an external treaty) after the [[handover of Hong Kong]].\n\n==Early colonial era==\n[[English common law]] has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, following the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', in the theory that people born within the dominion of [[The Crown]], which included self-governing [[British Dominions|dominions]] and [[Crown colonies]], would have a \"natural allegiance\" to the Crown as a \"debt of gratitude\" to the Crown for protecting them through infancy.  As the dominion of the British Empire expanded, [[British subject]]s included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the rest of the British Empire.\n\nBy this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842 was a British subject. The Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847 expanded what had been covered in the Naturalisation Act 1844, which applied only to people within the United Kingdom, to all its dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing for acquisition of British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a man with British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914===\n{{main|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914}}\nThe British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (now renamed as \"Status of Aliens Act 1914\") came into force on 1 January 1915, codifying for the first time the law relating to British nationality. No major change was introduced but it set into law how people associated with Hong Kong \u2013 as part of \"His Majesty's dominions\" \u2013 would acquire British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality Act 1948===\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations]]' heads of government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenship, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 provided for a new status of [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title [[Commonwealth citizen]].\n\nThe Act came into force on 1 January 1949 and stipulated that anyone born in \"United Kingdom or a colony\" on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British subjects on 31 December 1948 were entitled to acquire CUKC status by declaration. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958.\n\nBritish Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 and 1965, which mainly fine-tuned special provisions about CUKC status acquisition.\n\n===Commonwealth Immigrants Acts===\nUntil 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] and [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom.\n\nAs such, CUKCs connected with Hong Kong were subject to immigration control after 1962.\n\nFinally, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], the concept of patriality or [[right of abode]] was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.\n\nThese acts shaped an increasingly restrictive immigration policy into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of 1984.\n\n=== British Nationality Act 1981 and British Dependent Territories Citizenship ===\n[[Image:Old-hongkong-bp.jpg|thumb|A [[British passport]] for a BDTC with connection with Hong Kong]]\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1981]] created new categories of British nationality and renamed British colonial territories. After implementation, all British Crown colonies became [[British Dependent Territories]]. The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of nationality on 1 January 1983:\n* [[British Citizen]] (for residents of the UK and the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]])\n* [[British Dependent Territories Citizen]] (BDTC) (for the Crown colonies), and\n* [[British Overseas Citizen]] (BOC) (a class of non-inheritable nationality for those who are unable to become a British Citizen, a BDTC or a national of another country)\n\nThe law stated that those who have CUKC status by connection with Hong Kong and those born in Hong Kong on or after 1983 to a parent settled in Hong Kong are BDTCs. The law also stated that British Citizens or BDTCs by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or the dependent territories concerned unless a parent acquired citizenship otherwise than by descent.\n\n==After the Sino-British Joint Declaration==\n[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|right|100px]]\nNegotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong started in the late 1970s between Britain and China. With the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on 19 December 1984, the future of Hong Kong was set, with China to assume sovereignty of the entire territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.\n\nAt that time, there were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Another 2 million were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. After the handover, they would have lost this status and became solely [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationals]]. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants.\n\n===Creation of the British National (Overseas) status===\n{{Demographics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Main|British National (Overseas)}}\n\nThe [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] created an additional category of [[British nationality law|British nationality]] known as ''[[British National (Overseas)]]'' or ''BN(O)''. This new category was available only to Hong Kong BDTCs, and any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so would be able to acquire the status of BN(O). The status was non-transferable and available only by application, and the deadline to apply was 30 June 1997.\n\n====British Overseas Citizen status for those who are 'otherwise stateless'====\nAny Hong Kong BDTCs who failed to register as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a [[British Overseas Citizen]] under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |title=Article 6(1), ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'' |access-date=18 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990: British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families===\n{{Main|British Nationality Selection Scheme}}\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989]], many people in Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]], which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1990/34/contents|title=British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990}}</ref> Under the Act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]] (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically ceased to be a BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.\n\n===Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996: British citizenship for Hong Kong war wives and widows===\nWomen who had received assurance from the Secretary of State that they would be eligible for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of their husband's war service in the defence of Hong Kong may be registered as British Citizens if they were resident in Hong Kong and had not remarried. There is no requirement for the woman to hold (or have held) any form of British nationality. Women registered as British Citizens under this act acquire British citizenship \"otherwise than by descent\" and thus also their children would be [[British Citizen]]s.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1996/41/contents|title=Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996}}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) without Chinese ancestry===\nAnother special group of solely Hong Kong British nationals were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or children of immigrants from Nepal, India and [[Pakistan]]. After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to China, they would not be accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively [[stateless person|stateless]] \u2013 they would have British nationality and [[permanent residency]] and right of abode in Hong Kong, but no right of abode in the UK, nor a right to claim [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationality]].\n\nThe ethnic minorities petitioned to be granted full British citizenship,<ref>[http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html A Pasage to Nowhere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910112715/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html |date=10 September 2005 }} (Prism Nov 1995) ''accessed 1 Aug 2010''</ref> and were backed by several politicians [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], then the Shadow Home Secretary said <ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 ]{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> in a letter to the then Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that \"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China\". He further stated that a claim that BN(O) status amounts to British nationality \"is pure sophistry\".</ref> and media.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'' also said that \"the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong's residents was shameful\", and \"it was the height of cynicism to hand 6 million people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere.\" The article also stated that the real reason that the new Labour government still refused to give full British citizenship to other BDTCs was because if the UK waited until Hong Kong had been disposed of it \"would be seen as highly cynical\", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|The Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, conceded. (\"Britain's colonial obligations\", 3 July 1997, ''[[The Economist]]'')</ref> The subsequently enacted British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1997/20/contents|title=British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997}}</ref> gives them an entitlement to acquire full British citizenship by making an application to register for that status after 1 July 1997.\n\n===Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: British Overseas Territories Citizen status is not applicable to Hong Kong===\nIn light of the passing of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]], which made provision to substitute the wording of \"British Dependent Territories\" with \"[[British Overseas Territories]]\" in the British Nationality Act 1981 among other new provisions, further clarification was made even though this act did not even apply to Hong Kong. Section 14 of the subsequent Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 stated specifically that a person may not be registered as a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]] (BOTC) by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong.\n\n===Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who do not have another nationality or citizenship===\n{{main|Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009}}\nA small group of Hong Kong ethnic minorities had not been eligible for acquiring British citizenship under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 because they were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong before 4 February 1997 or they were under 18 / 21 years of age, had dual nationality through their parents on or after 4 February 1997, but had lost it upon turning 18/21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-nationality-hong-kong-act-1997-nationality-policy-guidance|title=Registration as a British citizen: British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> These BN(O)s lost their second nationality due to changes in the nationality laws of certain countries and had, therefore, become de facto stateless. They could register to become [[British citizens]] under section 4B of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] as amended by [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] to \"remedy the limbo status of probably the last remaining group of solely British nationals who have no other nationality or citizenship, who have not recently and deliberately given up another nationality or citizenship\".<ref>[[Lord Avebury]] in the [[House of Lords]]</ref> To be eligible for registration, they must demonstrate that they had not lost, through action or inaction, any other nationality on and after 19 March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/other-british-nationals-nationality-policy-guidance|title=Registration as a British citizen: other British nationals|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> Registration under s4B confers British citizenship by descent.\n\n==Chinese view on nationality of Hong Kong residents==\nThe Chinese government stated in its memorandum of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on December 19, 1984 that under the [[Chinese nationality law]], \"all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd6.htm| title = The Joint Declaration - Memoranda (Exchanged Between the Two Sides)|publisher= Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region | accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref> In 1990, when the [[Gulf War]] started, the Chinese embassy provided  a proof of Chinese citizenship to a Hong Kong Chinese businessman in Kuwait holding a BDTC passport and helped him evacuate.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u4e2d\u570b\u5167\u5730\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u5730\u5340\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u885d\u7a81\u8207\u5354\u8abf|trans-title = Conflict and Coordination of Laws of Mainland China and Hong Kong |publisher=Chung Hwa Book Company (Hong Kong) |editor=Dong Likun|year=2016|pages=181-182|language=zh}}</ref> [[Chinese nationality law]] has applied in Hong Kong since the handover on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong BDTC status ceased to exist and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong was presented at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes ''settled'' in a foreign country ''and'' acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became ''settled'' in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a [[dual nationality|dual national]]), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.\n\nThis is reflected in the position the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] has on Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who were Hong Kong permanent residents immediately before 1 July 1997 and hold non-Chinese nationality or citizenship. Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign consular protection in Hong Kong as long as they do not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/roa/eligible-position-chinese-hold-foreign-passports.html|title=The Position of Residents (including Former Residents) of Chinese Nationality who were Permanent Residents Immediately Before 1 July 1997 and Hold Foreign Passports &#124; Immigration Department|website=www.immd.gov.hk}}</ref>\n\n==Recent groups eligible for a form of British Nationality==\n\n===British citizenship for non-ethnic Chinese which were wrongfully denied===\nIn February 2006, in response to representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>[http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim, 6 December 2004 (Accessed 1 Aug 2010)]</ref> British authorities announced that six hundred British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf|title=British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong wrongly refused}}</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request.\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Indians (new Indian law)===\nRecent changes to India's ''Citizenship Act, 1955'' (see [[Indian nationality law]]) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a BN(O) or BOC parent to automatically acquire BOC status at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf articles 6(2) and 6(3) of the ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'']. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 register for full British citizenship].\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Nepalese (reinterpretation of Nepalese law)===\nRecent clarification of [[Nepal citizenship law]] has meant a number of persons born in Hong Kong who failed to renounce their British nationality before the age of 21 and were previously thought to be citizens of Nepal are in fact solely British. The British Government has recently accepted that certain Nepalese passport holders born in Hong Kong before 30 June 1976 are BOCs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office|title=Foreign & Commonwealth Office|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> and can register for British citizenship if they wish to do so.\n\n===British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who are otherwise stateless===\nThe passage of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 provides a path for British Nationals (Overseas) who had no other citizenship before 19 March 2009 to apply for British citizenship under s.&nbsp;4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. To qualify, they must demonstrate that they had not lost or renounced any other nationalities, through action or inaction, on or after 19 March 2009.\n\n==Future of the British National (Overseas) status: Lord Goldsmith's citizenship review in 2008==\n[[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] discussed the BN(O) issue in his citizenship review in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405223352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-05|title=Wayback Machine|date=5 April 2008|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> He regarded the BN(O) status as \"anomalous\" in the history of British nationality law, but saw no alternative to preserving this status.<ref>\"Nonetheless to remove this status without putting something significant in its place would be seen as the British reneging on their promise to the people of Hong Kong. The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship. It is likely that many would not take this up as the prospects economic and fiscal of moving to the UK are not favourable to those well-established in Hong Kong. However, I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, an international treaty between the two countries; and that to secure Chinese agreement to vary the terms of that treaty would not be possible. On that basis, I see no alternative but to preserve this one anomalous category of citizenship\": Chapter 4, paragraph 12.</ref>\n\nHowever, Goldsmith stated in February 2020:<ref>{{Cite

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s, [[Judge|judge]]s, [[arbitrator]]s, [[administrative law judge]]s, [[commission]]s{{efn-ua|Defined broadly to include [[government agency]], [[regulatory agency]] or [[statutory authority]] that operates under the authority of a board of commissioners, including [[Independent agencies of the United States government]].}} or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls final [[Adjudication|adjudication]] or resolution of a [[Motion (legal)|motion]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

[[Nachmanides]] understands the advice given by [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:22, to judge the people at all times, as suggesting that Israel needed more judges because potential litigants would otherwise suffer injustice due to their inability to find a judge to hear their case.<ref>[http://tmt.urj.net/archives/4jewishethics/052605.htm 10 Minutes of Torah.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position.

It is the sequel to ''[[Subnautica]]'', which was released in January 2018.\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' was released in [[early access]] for Microsoft Windows and macOS in January 2019. \n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' is a [[Survival game|survival]], [[Adventure game|adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player controls a researcher researching the local environment and nearby alien facility, on planet 4546B.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of ''[[Subnautica]]''. Alterra has placed the Vesper Station into orbit around the planet 4546B for research. The story opens with the Player being told to head to the nearby Mountain Alien Facility to locate Serik Jevov (Jeff). The player then encounters the voice of one of The Architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone; the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. Afterward, the Alien Facility is  struck by a meteor and begins re-routing its power to Sanctuary. The player is told to get to the escape ship back at base, however, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an Avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing them to have to swim out into open water, and head to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communication ability. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message tracked to the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges. Once the player is exploring the Underwater Alien Facility, they are threatened by an Alien voice saying that its storage medium is failing. As the player reaches the inner of the Alien Facility, it notes that is has found an \"adequate storage medium\". The player offers their PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into, however, it transfers into the players Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player knows its name is Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, their PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring the player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed anywhere from 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, they are told the ship that took off at the beginning of the game crash-landed in the Glacial Basin and that they have three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player can locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, they find a Cache with one of The Architect body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, they get a message saying that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the player's adventure, they find two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to The Architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, they are told that they are able to construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe Player gets contacted by Sam to be told that The Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that they need a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an Architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The player then calls Robin and the Mission director about what happened, Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as they are most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside The Player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that they need to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\nAfter the player receives the White tablet to enter the facility, they head to the Alien Facility and enter it.  The game ends with The Vesper station being blown up.\n\n<!--== Plot == how are there two different plots? That needs explaining for inclusion.\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of Subnautica. Alterra is funding a smaller company called XenoWorks, which the player works for. The player heads down on a shuttle to the surface of 4546B trying to \"cover from Alterra satellites\" to find their sister, Sam. On the way down, a meteor crashes into the player causing their lifepod to deploy and them to crash land in Sector Zero.\n-->\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/ Official website]\n\n{{uncategorised|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2019 video game}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}{{Sources exist|date=April 2020}}{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Subnautica Below Zero\n| image = \n| caption = \n| developer = [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]\n| publisher = Unknown Worlds Entertainment\n| director = Charlie Cleveland\n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = {{Unbulleted list|Cory Strader|Brian Cummings|Scott MacDonald\n<ref name=\"Crew\">{{cite web|last=Jeremy|first=Hugh|title=The Crew of Subnautica|url=http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|publisher=[[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]|date=December 17, 2013|access-date=April 9, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417144732/http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n| writer = [[Tom Jubert]]\n| composer =\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[MacOS]]}}\n| released = \n| genre = {{hlist|[[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]]|[[survival game|survival]]}}\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Subnautica Below Zero''''' is an [[open world]] [[Survival game|survival]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]].
