No Name products are available in stores across Canada that include [[Loblaws]], [[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]], [[Dominion Stores (Newfoundland)|Dominion]], [[Real Canadian Superstore]], [[Your Independent Grocer]], [[valu-mart]], [[Zehrs]], [[Fortinos]], [[Provigo]], [[Extra Foods]], [[SuperValu (Canada)|Super-Valu]], [[Maxi (Canadian supermarket)|Maxi]], [[Atlantic Superstore]], and [[Shoppers Drug Mart]].\n\n==Launch==\n\nOn March 21, 1978, Loblaw launched \"No Name\" with 16 generic or unbranded items in black and yellow packaging. It was initially promoted as \"basic products in plain packaging at down-to-earth everyday low prices\", No Name promised savings of between 10 and 40 percent over national brands. The launch beat rival supermarket chain Dominion, with its own line of generic products, by 24 hours. Available at Loblaws' 135 stores across Ontario, full-page ads claimed that No Name offered the best value for money as a combination of price and quality \u2013 the result of cost controls associated with using standard instead of custom packaging and the efforts of its own \"task force\" in negotiating lower priced, bulk orders from suppliers.<ref name=newatloblaws>{{Citation | title =New! At Loblaws (advertisement)  | newspaper =Toronto Star  | date =March 21, 1978 }}</ref>  \n\nThe introduction of No Name, along with other generics, coincided with a period of rising inflation rates and consumer complaints regarding the high price of food.<ref name=\"suffer\">{{Citation  | title =Canadians suffer in silence, buy less as food prices rise   | newspaper =Toronto Star   | date =May 12, 1978 }}</ref> Two years earlier, French hypermarket [[Carrefour]] unveiled Produits Libres, a line of 50 unbranded products.

Grocery shoppers have snapped them up at a rate that has astonished even Nichol.  In nine months, Loblaws has sold 15 million of them, which Nichol says is enough to make Ontario the largest market in the world for unbranded products.  And strangely enough, Loblaws shoppers seem to be developing a brand loyalty to these unbranded products.<ref name=mrnoname>{{Citation | title =He's Mr. No-name of Loblaws | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =January 21, 1979 }}\u3000 The Japan-based unbranded multinational [[Muji]] first products released in 1980 that eventually surpassed No Name in sales.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA few months after the launch, Loblaws opened the first [[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]] store, a deep discount, limited service and selection supermarket, with only 500 items, which featured No Name among its product selection.  The opening proved a success and two more Toronto area stores soon followed.  Meanwhile, Nichol continued to heavily promote No Name on television and was dubbed \"Mr. No Name\" by news headlines.<ref name=mrnoname /> While one competitor spoke critically of Nichol for spending so much on advertising, thereby increasing the costs associated with a discount product line, Nichol responded that Loblaw had simply redirected more of its promotional budget towards No Name.<ref name=willsuccess>{{Citation | title =Will success kill no frills food? | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =March 21, 1979 }}</ref> Four months after the launch, generic products across all Canadian grocery store shelves accounted for nearly 10 percent of supermarket sales.<ref name=supermarketman>{{Citation | title =Super market man | magazine =Maclean's | date =November 3, 1986 }}</ref> One year later, Loblaw had expanded its generic line-up to over a hundred items.\n\n==Branding, packaging and promotion==\n[[File:No name sans nom canada corned beef ideal pour sandwichs.jpg|thumbnail|No name corned beef]]\n\nIn keeping with the generic nature of the product line, the original No Name packaging showed no branding \u2013 only text with a basic product description and name, such as \"freshly ground coffee\" or \"fabric softener,\" on a solid background.  Years later, a \"No Name\" registered trademark appeared.  While other generic lines presented their packaging as black on white, Toronto designer [[Don Watt (designer)|Don Watt]] chose black, boldface text in a [[Helvetica]] font, all lower case, on a bright yellow background, as a means of attracting the attention of shoppers.  \n\nThroughout the 1980s, Loblaw continued to promote No Name as a value-oriented alternative to higher priced, nationally advertised products.  In 1981, Dave Nichol went on television with two grocery carts, one with a selection of No Name items and the other with comparable national brands, to demonstrate a 30 percent savings:\n\n<blockquote>For five or six years I did nothing but go into people's living rooms and say, 'Here's one basket of national brands for $150, and here are the same products from no name for $100. If you don't like them, we'll give you the national brands free.<ref name=\"brandkillers\"/></blockquote>\n\nBy 1982, the number of No Name items had increased to some 500 different products and ranged from canned peas, to spaghetti sauce, to tooth paste and even windshield washer fluid. The ''Financial Times of Canada'' noted that in spite of basic packaging and the reputation of generics as inferior, \"Loblaws No Name line was, in fact, competing directly with national brands.\"<ref name=genericgame>{{Citation  | title =Generic game not all in the name  | newspaper =Financial Times of Canada  | date =May 22, 1982}}</ref>   The newspaper also commented that the heavy promotion of No Name by Loblaws president Dave Nichol had helped boost the sale of generics in all supermarkets.  \n\nLoblaw also expanded the line beyond basic grocery and household items in an apparent bid to appeal to a wider range of consumer tastes.  Products such as No Name gourmet barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, escargot and imported jams from France appeared on Loblaw shelves.   In late 1983, \"President\u2019s Blend gourmet coffee\", in the familiar black and yellow packaging, made its debut and sales proved so strong that the decision was made to create a separate, premium line of products called \"[[President's Choice]]\".  Beyond gourmet items, there were also those of a more unusual, albeit still practical, nature such as the No Name raccoon-proof garbage pail, with steel handles that clamped to the sides of the container. But most No Name items continued to be everyday products, with the brand promoted as \"a sensible solution to rising prices.\"<ref name=pamphlet>{{Citation  | title =Product pamphlet  | newspaper =George Weston Limited   | year =1984 }}</ref>  By the end of the decade there were more than 1,800 No Name products available. \n\nBy the mid-1980s, No Name had become the best selling brand in the country \u2013 a somewhat ironic development, considering the generic, non-branded nature of the product line, promoted as an economical alternative to the national brands.  Additionally, No Name had achieved such prominence in spite of being available only in Loblaw owned stores.  Media reports attributed much of that success to Dave Nichol and his marketing efforts.  \"Under Nichol's supervision, the country's No Name products have become the largest-selling national brand in Canada, one of the few countries in the world where generic brands compete with well-known names\", wrote Maclean's magazine.<ref name=supermarketman />  But according to Nichol, the big name brands were also vulnerable:\n\n<blockquote>I happened to come along at a time when the national brands had prostituted the quality of their products.  It is so easy to produce products that are superior to almost every national brand.<ref name=supermarketman /> \n</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1980s, No Name diverged from its original plain packaging as red lettering and various product illustrations were added.  Meanwhile, a 1987 segment of the [[CTV Television Network]] show ''[[Live It Up! (TV series)|Live It Up!]]'' took the position that the line\u2019s product packaging wasn't doing enough to adequately distinguish relatively harmless cooking sprays from more dangerous cleaning products.  During that same program, a Loblaw executive presented the company\u2019s solution \u2013 a No Name spray canister with a red cap to indicate potentially harmful contents.  \n\nIn the 1990s, photography was increasingly incorporated as No Name packaging became more elaborate and less distinguishable from national brand products.  Additional formats were also introduced, such as \"No Name Club Pack\" and promoted as \"No Membership Required\" in order to compete with 'big box' membership-based competitors who offered bulk items at reduced prices. \n\nWith the increasing popularity of the President's Choice brand through the 1980s and 1990s, attention and advertising dollars shifted to Loblaw's premium line.  Nevertheless, the number and range of No Name products grew.  The generic line also continued to do well in consumer affairs testing as conducted by media outlets.  A 1982 product comparison ranked No Name windshield washer fluid among the top four of eight tested as all \"equally excellent\",<ref name=washerfluid>{{Citation  | title =No-name windshield washer fluid tops on our list  | newspaper =Toronto Star  | date =February 13, 1982}}</ref> while No Name disposable diapers came in a close second to Dominion's generic label, beating out the national brands.<ref name=diapers>{{Citation | title =Generic, private label diapers beat national brands\n  | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =June 13, 1982}}</ref>  A 1989 Toronto Star taste testing panel ranked No Name freshly roasted ground coffee fourth out of eleven different nationally available brands.<ref name=judgingjava>{{Citation | title =Judging java| newspaper =Toronto Star  | date =November 8, 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Re-launch of No Name==\nIn 2009, Loblaws re-launched No Name, \"the iconic brand and its unmistakable plain black printing on yellow packaging\".<ref name=\"nonamewho\">{{Cite web| title =no name - who?| publisher =brandchannel| date =April 6, 2009| url =http://www.brandchannel.com/print_page.asp?ar_id=433&section=profile| accessdate =September 22, 2010| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120302205046/http://www.brandchannel.com/print_page.asp?ar_id=433&section=profile| archivedate =March 2, 2012}}</ref> New product packaging included a return to black Helvetica lettering on a yellow background, along with some limited product illustration.   Loblaws executive David Primorac said the company decided to bring back the original colour palette as something familiar to shoppers.  \"It's something recognizable and it's easy for consumers.\"<ref name=\"nonamewho\" />  Also, for the first time since the early 1990s, No Name television commercials were aired which showed Loblaws Executive Chairman [[Galen G. Weston]] in a shopping cart comparison reminiscent of the Dave Nichol commercials of the early 1980s:\n\n<blockquote>\nPointing at the cart of \"top selling no name products\" and then the cart filled with \"26 comparable national brands\", Weston says \nthe national brands cost $100.38 in its stores, while the No Name brands cost just $73.91.  That's a savings of $26.46, he adds.  \n(Based on average prices from May 25 to Nov. 22 in 922 Loblaws-owned stores, the company notes in fine-print.)  He then removes any risk involved in switching by saying if you don't like the no name version, Loblaws will give you your money back.<ref name=namegame>{{Citation | title =Name game | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =January 16, 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWeston also made reference to the economic recession, noting that these are \"challenging times and you need real, no-nonsense ways to stretch your dollar\".  A later series of television commercials simply showed text on a yellow background with various promotional lines on how No Name \"helps you save\".   One ad noted, \"We don't have a single item under $2.  We have 300.\"  David Rosenberg, creative director for Bensimon Byrne, the Toronto agency which created the TV spots, commented that the ads were produced for a fraction of what a standard Canadian TV commercial costs.<ref name=whatsin>{{Citation | title =What's in a name? | newspaper =Vancouver Sun | date =January 22, 2010 }}</ref> \n\nWith tougher economic times, the company has refocused its attention on its \"control label\" program.  According to vice president Paul Uys, \"private brands are very important in a recession.\"  Noting the company's renewed competitive bent, he described how some national brands were infringing on the company's own frozen rising-crust pizza sales. Loblaws switched its product from the President's Choice label to No Name, dropped the price by a dollar and gave it prominent display space.  Sales subsequently rebounded.<ref name=remakinganame>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Marina|title=(Re)making a name in No Name|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=March 21, 2009}}</ref>   \n \nSince the launch of No Name in 1978, the generic line has expanded from the original 16 items to more than 2,900 different products.\n\nIn 2019, Loblaw launched a multi-platform advertising campaign for the brand (its largest since 2009), with a focus on its \"Simple Check\" program\u2014 which covers No Name products produced without ingredients such as [[hydrogenated oil]], or artificial colours and flavouring. The campaign has included [[social media marketing]], such as an official [[Twitter]] account containing [[deadpan]] quips regarding its products (\"[[Biscuit|Social tea biscuits]] \u2014 can be consumed alone\") and \"[[liveblogging]]\" the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] (\"a winner has won again\"), as well as an attempted \"[[Cats and the Internet|viral cat video]]\". The campaign also included [[out-of-home advertising]], primarily within the Toronto area, including [[GO Transit|GO]] trains and a [[taxi cab]] with [[livery]] mimicking No Name's packaging and social media posts (with the former labelled \"for going places\"), as well as billboards, and mural ads at [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/on/toronto/no-name-advertisements-are-suddenly-popping-up-all-over-toronto-photos|title=No Name Advertisements Are Suddenly Popping Up All Over Toronto (PHOTOS)|website=Narcity.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2019/09/30/no-name-brands-deadpan-ad-campaign-takes-over-union-station.html|title=No name brand\u2019s deadpan ad campaign takes over Toronto\u2019s Union Station|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/digital/canadas-no-name-brand-launches-its-largest-ad-campaign-ever/2200891|title=Canada\u2019s \u2018No Name\u2019 brand launches its largest ad campaign ever|date=2019-09-30|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mediaincanada.com/2019/09/16/after-years-of-no-campaigns-no-name-says-no-more/|title=No Name says yes to largest campaign spend in 40 years|last=Rody-Mantha|first=Bree|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/creativity/work/no-name-simple-check-campaign/2202771|title=Canada's 'No Name' brand brings its no-nonsense packaging to its largest campaign ever|last=Craft|first=Ethan|date=2019-09-30|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n== Imitations in other countries ==\nHere is a list of countries where supermarkets have taken the same approach in packing their products.\n\n=== Italy ===\nItalian supermarket [[Esselunga]] launched a new line of products called \"SMART\" and featuring the same yellow and generic packaging as No Name.

A 1982 product comparison ranked No Name windshield washer fluid among the top four of eight tested as all \"equally excellent\",<ref name=washerfluid>{{Citation  | title =No-name windshield washer fluid tops on our list  | newspaper =Toronto Star  | date =February 13, 1982}}</ref> while No Name disposable diapers came in a close second to Dominion's generic label, beating out the national brands.<ref name=diapers>{{Citation | title =Generic, private label diapers beat national brands\n  | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =June 13, 1982}}</ref>  A 1989 Toronto Star taste testing panel ranked No Name freshly roasted ground coffee fourth out of eleven different nationally available brands.<ref name=judgingjava>{{Citation | title =Judging java| newspaper =Toronto Star  | date =November 8, 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Re-launch of No Name==\nIn 2009, Loblaws re-launched No Name, \"the iconic brand and its unmistakable plain black printing on yellow packaging\".<ref name=\"nonamewho\">{{Cite web| title =no name - who?| publisher =brandchannel| date =April 6, 2009| url =http://www.brandchannel.com/print_page.asp?ar_id=433&section=profile| accessdate =September 22, 2010| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120302205046/http://www.brandchannel.com/print_page.asp?ar_id=433&section=profile| archivedate =March 2, 2012}}</ref> New product packaging included a return to black Helvetica lettering on a yellow background, along with some limited product illustration.   Loblaws executive David Primorac said the company decided to bring back the original colour palette as something familiar to shoppers.  \"It's something recognizable and it's easy for consumers.\"<ref name=\"nonamewho\" />  Also, for the first time since the early 1990s, No Name television commercials were aired which showed Loblaws Executive Chairman [[Galen G. Weston]] in a shopping cart comparison reminiscent of the Dave Nichol commercials of the early 1980s:\n\n<blockquote>\nPointing at the cart of \"top selling no name products\" and then the cart filled with \"26 comparable national brands\", Weston says \nthe national brands cost $100.38 in its stores, while the No Name brands cost just $73.91.  That's a savings of $26.46, he adds.  \n(Based on average prices from May 25 to Nov. 22 in 922 Loblaws-owned stores, the company notes in fine-print.)  He then removes any risk involved in switching by saying if you don't like the no name version, Loblaws will give you your money back.<ref name=namegame>{{Citation | title =Name game | newspaper =Toronto Star | date =January 16, 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWeston also made reference to the economic recession, noting that these are \"challenging times and you need real, no-nonsense ways to stretch your dollar\".  A later series of television commercials simply showed text on a yellow background with various promotional lines on how No Name \"helps you save\".   One ad noted, \"We don't have a single item under $2.  We have 300.\"  David Rosenberg, creative director for Bensimon Byrne, the Toronto agency which created the TV spots, commented that the ads were produced for a fraction of what a standard Canadian TV commercial costs.<ref name=whatsin>{{Citation | title =What's in a name? | newspaper =Vancouver Sun | date =January 22, 2010 }}</ref> \n\nWith tougher economic times, the company has refocused its attention on its \"control label\" program.  According to vice president Paul Uys, \"private brands are very important in a recession.\"  Noting the company's renewed competitive bent, he described how some national brands were infringing on the company's own frozen rising-crust pizza sales. Loblaws switched its product from the President's Choice label to No Name, dropped the price by a dollar and gave it prominent display space.  Sales subsequently rebounded.<ref name=remakinganame>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Marina|title=(Re)making a name in No Name|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=March 21, 2009}}</ref>   \n \nSince the launch of No Name in 1978, the generic line has expanded from the original 16 items to more than 2,900 different products.\n\nIn 2019, Loblaw launched a multi-platform advertising campaign for the brand (its largest since 2009), with a focus on its \"Simple Check\" program\u2014 which covers No Name products produced without ingredients such as [[hydrogenated oil]], or artificial colours and flavouring. The campaign has included [[social media marketing]], such as an official [[Twitter]] account containing [[deadpan]] quips regarding its products (\"[[Biscuit|Social tea biscuits]] \u2014 can be consumed alone\") and \"[[liveblogging]]\" the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] (\"a winner has won again\"), as well as an attempted \"[[Cats and the Internet|viral cat video]]\". The campaign also included [[out-of-home advertising]], primarily within the Toronto area, including [[GO Transit|GO]] trains and a [[taxi cab]] with [[livery]] mimicking No Name's packaging and social media posts (with the former labelled \"for going places\"), as well as billboards, and mural ads at [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/on/toronto/no-name-advertisements-are-suddenly-popping-up-all-over-toronto-photos|title=No Name Advertisements Are Suddenly Popping Up All Over Toronto (PHOTOS)|website=Narcity.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2019/09/30/no-name-brands-deadpan-ad-campaign-takes-over-union-station.html|title=No name brand\u2019s deadpan ad campaign takes over Toronto\u2019s Union Station|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/digital/canadas-no-name-brand-launches-its-largest-ad-campaign-ever/2200891|title=Canada\u2019s \u2018No Name\u2019 brand launches its largest ad campaign ever|date=2019-09-30|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mediaincanada.com/2019/09/16/after-years-of-no-campaigns-no-name-says-no-more/|title=No Name says yes to largest campaign spend in 40 years|last=Rody-Mantha|first=Bree|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/creativity/work/no-name-simple-check-campaign/2202771|title=Canada's 'No Name' brand brings its no-nonsense packaging to its largest campaign ever|last=Craft|first=Ethan|date=2019-09-30|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n== Imitations in other countries ==\nHere is a list of countries where supermarkets have taken the same approach in packing their products.\n\n=== Italy ===\nItalian supermarket [[Esselunga]] launched a new line of products called \"SMART\" and featuring the same yellow and generic packaging as No Name.

The battery was occupied by the 2nd Battery of Army Coastal Artillery Regiment 1260 (2/HKAA.1260).<ref>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steven |date= 10 November 2005|title=D-Day Fortifications in Normandy |url= |location= |publisher=Osprey Publications |isbn=9781841768762 }}</ref> To defend the promontory from attack, elements of the 352nd Infantry Division were stationed at the battery.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Gun at Battery Moltke, Les Landes, Jersey 02.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Canon de 155mm GPF|15.5 cm K 418(f)]] gun, of the type used in the Pointe du Hoc battery, is preserved at the Atlantic Wall on [[Jersey]].]]\nTo provide increased defensive capability, the Germans began to improve the defenses of the battery in the spring of 1944, with enclosed H671 concrete [[casemate]]s. The plan was to build six casemates but two were unfinished when the location was attacked. The casemates were built over and in front of the circular gun pits, which housed the 155mm guns. Also built was a H636 observation bunker and L409a mounts for [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|20mm Flak 30 anti-aircraft guns]]. The 155mm guns would have threatened the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings on Omaha and Utah beaches when finished, risking heavy casualties to the landing forces.\n\nThe location was bombed in April 1944, after which the Germans removed the 155mm guns. During the preparation for [[Operation Overlord]] it was determined that Pointe du Hoc should be attacked by ground forces, to prevent the Germans using the casemates for observation. The U.S. [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd]] and [[5th Ranger Battalion (United States)|5th Ranger Battalion]]s were given the task of assaulting the strong point early on [[D-Day]]. Elements of the 2nd Battalion went in to attack Pointe du Hoc but delays meant the remainder of the 2nd Battalion and the complete 5th Battalion landed at Omaha Beach as their secondary landing position.\n\nThough the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc, the beachheads were shelled by field artillery from the nearby [[Maisy battery]], on the fire support plan of heavy cruiser HMS ''Hawkins.''<ref>Naval Bombardment at D-Day chart. (1962) Wikimedia commons.</ref> The rediscovery of the battery at Maisy has shown that it was responsible for firing on the Allied beachheads until 9 June 1944.<ref>http://www.maisybattery.com The Maisy Battery</ref><ref name=Sterne>{{Cite book |last=Sterne |first=Gary |title=The Cover-up at Omaha Beach |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=9781629143279 |page=286}}</ref>\n\n== Plan ==\n[[File:Preinvasion bombing of Pointe du Hoc.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Pre-invasion [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] of Pointe du Hoc by 9th Air Force [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] bombers</center>]]\n\nPointe du Hoc lay within the [[Leonard T. Gerow|General Leonard Gerow]]'s [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] field of operations. This then went to the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] (the Big Red One) and then down to the right-hand assault formation, the 116th Infantry Regiment attached from [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Division]]. In addition they were given two Ranger battalions to undertake the attack.\n\nThe Ranger battalions were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[James Earl Rudder]]. The plan called for the three companies of Rangers to be landed by sea at the foot of the cliffs, scale them using ropes, ladders, and grapples while under enemy fire, and engage the enemy at the top of the cliff. This was to be carried out before the main landings. The Rangers trained for the cliff assault on the [[Isle of Wight]], under the direction of [[British Commandos]].\n\nMajor Cleveland A. Lytle was to command Companies D, E and F of the 2nd Ranger Battalion (known as \"Force A\") in the assault at Pointe du Hoc.

Flares from the cliff tops were to signal this second wave to join the attack, but because of the delayed landing, the signal came too late, and the other Rangers landed on Omaha instead of Pointe du Hoc. The added impetus these 500 plus Rangers provided on the stalled Omaha Beach landing has been conjectured to have averted a disastrous failure {{citation needed|date=July 2014}} there, since they carried the assault beyond the beach, into the overlooking bluffs and outflanked the German defenses.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nWhen the Rangers made it to the top, they had sustained 15 casualties. \"Ranger casualties on the beach totalled about 15, most of them from the raking fire to their left\".<ref>US Army Small Unit After Action Report for Pointe du Hoc 1944.</ref> The force also found that their radios were ineffective.<ref>Beevor, p. 103</ref>  Upon reaching the fortifications, most of the Rangers learned for the first time that the main objective of the assault, the artillery battery, had been removed. The Rangers regrouped at the top of the cliffs, and a small patrol went off in search of the guns. Two different patrols found five of the six guns nearby (the sixth was being fixed elsewhere) and destroyed their firing mechanisms with [[thermite]] [[grenade]]s.<ref name=\"ABMC Pointe du Hoc\"/>\n\nThere was a legend, possibly true, of a secret United States Army detachment of the 2nd Ranger Battalion in charge of securing the German maps. The maps contained the location of well-hidden artillery made discreet by the German Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel]]. This was led by 1st Lieutenant James Schwarz, who was accompanied by others of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. The mission was to dress in appropriate German [[Wehrmacht]] uniforms and retrieve the artillery locations via field maps. These men were able to secure the artillery locations but before they were able to hand these enemy maps off, the German soldiers had caught them in a field close to artillery placements. The maps never reached Allied forces.\n\n===German counter-attacks===\nThe costliest part of the battle for Pointe du Hoc for the Rangers came after the successful cliff assault.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/75-years-from-that-long-day-in-Normandy-we-still-have-something-to-learn-592307 75 years from that long day in Normandy \u2013 we still have something to learn], [[The Jerusalem Post]], June 12, 2019.</ref> Determined to hold the vital high ground, yet isolated from other Allied forces, the Rangers fended off several counter-attacks from the German [[914th Grenadier Regiment]]. The 5th Ranger Battalion and elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment headed towards Pointe du Hoc from Omaha Beach. However, only twenty-three Rangers from the 5th were able to link up with the 2nd Rangers during the evening of 6 June 1944. During the night the Germans forced the Rangers into a smaller enclave along the cliff, and some were taken prisoner.<ref name=Sterne/>{{rp|84\u2013140}}\n\nIt was not until the morning of 8 June that the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc were finally relieved by the 2nd and 5th Rangers, plus the 1st Battalion of the 116th Infantry, accompanied by tanks from the [[743rd Tank Battalion]].<ref name=Sterne/>{{rp|133\u2013134}}\n\nWhen the Rangers began suffering heavy losses, brief consideration was given to sending in the 84-man Marine Detachment aboard the battleship U.S.S.

Rudder claimed that his orders were to hold the Grancamp\u2013[[Vierville-sur-Mer|Vierville]] Highway to prevent a German counterattack after taking Pointe du Hoc, but Sterne found no such orders in the declassified historical records.<ref name=\"WashPost 2019 story\">{{cite news|last=Higham|first=Scott|title=One of D-Day's most famous, heroic assaults may have been unnecessary|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/02/one-d-days-most-famous-heroic-assaults-may-have-been-unnecessary|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 2, 2019|accessdate=June 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy not proceeding further south as his original orders required, Rudder may have cost additional American lives. For three days after the initial landings, the Germans kept firing the Maisy guns, which were still in range of [[Omaha Beach]].

The battery was occupied by the 2nd Battery of Army Coastal Artillery Regiment 1260 (2/HKAA.1260).<ref>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steven |date= 10 November 2005|title=D-Day Fortifications in Normandy |url= |location= |publisher=Osprey Publications |isbn=9781841768762 }}</ref> To defend the promontory from attack, elements of the 352nd Infantry Division were stationed at the battery.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Gun at Battery Moltke, Les Landes, Jersey 02.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Canon de 155mm GPF|15.5 cm K 418(f)]] gun, of the type used in the Pointe du Hoc battery, is preserved at the Atlantic Wall on [[Jersey]].]]\nTo provide increased defensive capability, the Germans began to improve the defenses of the battery in the spring of 1944, with enclosed H671 concrete [[casemate]]s. The plan was to build six casemates but two were unfinished when the location was attacked. The casemates were built over and in front of the circular gun pits, which housed the 155mm guns. Also built was a H636 observation bunker and L409a mounts for [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|20mm Flak 30 anti-aircraft guns]]. The 155mm guns would have threatened the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings on Omaha and Utah beaches when finished, risking heavy casualties to the landing forces.\n\nThe location was bombed in April 1944, after which the Germans removed the 155mm guns. During the preparation for [[Operation Overlord]] it was determined that Pointe du Hoc should be attacked by ground forces, to prevent the Germans using the casemates for observation. The U.S. [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd]] and [[5th Ranger Battalion (United States)|5th Ranger Battalion]]s were given the task of assaulting the strong point early on [[D-Day]]. Elements of the 2nd Battalion went in to attack Pointe du Hoc but delays meant the remainder of the 2nd Battalion and the complete 5th Battalion landed at Omaha Beach as their secondary landing position.\n\nThough the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc, the beachheads were shelled by field artillery from the nearby [[Maisy battery]], on the fire support plan of heavy cruiser HMS ''Hawkins.''<ref>Naval Bombardment at D-Day chart. (1962) Wikimedia commons.</ref> The rediscovery of the battery at Maisy has shown that it was responsible for firing on the Allied beachheads until 9 June 1944.<ref>http://www.maisybattery.com The Maisy Battery</ref><ref name=Sterne>{{Cite book |last=Sterne |first=Gary |title=The Cover-up at Omaha Beach |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=9781629143279 |page=286}}</ref>\n\n== Plan ==\n[[File:Preinvasion bombing of Pointe du Hoc.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Pre-invasion [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] of Pointe du Hoc by 9th Air Force [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] bombers</center>]]\n\nPointe du Hoc lay within the [[Leonard T. Gerow|General Leonard Gerow]]'s [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] field of operations. This then went to the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] (the Big Red One) and then down to the right-hand assault formation, the 116th Infantry Regiment attached from [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Division]]. In addition they were given two Ranger battalions to undertake the attack.\n\nThe Ranger battalions were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[James Earl Rudder]]. The plan called for the three companies of Rangers to be landed by sea at the foot of the cliffs, scale them using ropes, ladders, and grapples while under enemy fire, and engage the enemy at the top of the cliff. This was to be carried out before the main landings. The Rangers trained for the cliff assault on the [[Isle of Wight]], under the direction of [[British Commandos]].\n\nMajor Cleveland A. Lytle was to command Companies D, E and F of the 2nd Ranger Battalion (known as \"Force A\") in the assault at Pointe du Hoc.

Flares from the cliff tops were to signal this second wave to join the attack, but because of the delayed landing, the signal came too late, and the other Rangers landed on Omaha instead of Pointe du Hoc. The added impetus these 500 plus Rangers provided on the stalled Omaha Beach landing has been conjectured to have averted a disastrous failure {{citation needed|date=July 2014}} there, since they carried the assault beyond the beach, into the overlooking bluffs and outflanked the German defenses.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nWhen the Rangers made it to the top, they had sustained 15 casualties. \"Ranger casualties on the beach totalled about 15, most of them from the raking fire to their left\".<ref>US Army Small Unit After Action Report for Pointe du Hoc 1944.</ref> The force also found that their radios were ineffective.<ref>Beevor, p. 103</ref>  Upon reaching the fortifications, most of the Rangers learned for the first time that the main objective of the assault, the artillery battery, had been removed. The Rangers regrouped at the top of the cliffs, and a small patrol went off in search of the guns. Two different patrols found five of the six guns nearby (the sixth was being fixed elsewhere) and destroyed their firing mechanisms with [[thermite]] [[grenade]]s.<ref name=\"ABMC Pointe du Hoc\"/>\n\nThere was a legend, possibly true, of a secret United States Army detachment of the 2nd Ranger Battalion in charge of securing the German maps. The maps contained the location of well-hidden artillery made discreet by the German Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel]]. This was led by 1st Lieutenant James Schwarz, who was accompanied by others of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. The mission was to dress in appropriate German [[Wehrmacht]] uniforms and retrieve the artillery locations via field maps. These men were able to secure the artillery locations but before they were able to hand these enemy maps off, the German soldiers had caught them in a field close to artillery placements. The maps never reached Allied forces.\n\n===German counter-attacks===\nThe costliest part of the battle for Pointe du Hoc for the Rangers came after the successful cliff assault.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/75-years-from-that-long-day-in-Normandy-we-still-have-something-to-learn-592307 75 years from that long day in Normandy \u2013 we still have something to learn], [[The Jerusalem Post]], June 12, 2019.</ref> Determined to hold the vital high ground, yet isolated from other Allied forces, the Rangers fended off several counter-attacks from the German [[914th Grenadier Regiment]]. The 5th Ranger Battalion and elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment headed towards Pointe du Hoc from Omaha Beach. However, only twenty-three Rangers from the 5th were able to link up with the 2nd Rangers during the evening of 6 June 1944.

Rudder claimed that his orders were to hold the Grancamp\u2013[[Vierville-sur-Mer|Vierville]] Highway to prevent a German counterattack after taking Pointe du Hoc, but Sterne found no such orders in the declassified historical records.<ref name=\"WashPost 2019 story\">{{cite news|last=Higham|first=Scott|title=One of D-Day's most famous, heroic assaults may have been unnecessary|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/02/one-d-days-most-famous-heroic-assaults-may-have-been-unnecessary|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 2, 2019|accessdate=June 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy not proceeding further south as his original orders required, Rudder may have cost additional American lives. For three days after the initial landings, the Germans kept firing the Maisy guns, which were still in range of [[Omaha Beach]].
