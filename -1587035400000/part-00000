[[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] and is now the [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] Under-23 lead coach.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51448667</ref>\n\nMorison started his career at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] at the age of 16, progressing through the club's [[youth system|centre of excellence]]. After featuring regularly for the club's [[reserve team]], Morison made his first-team debut in 2002, and played a total of 28 times for the club during his three years with Northampton. He left Northampton and joined [[Conference South]] side [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] for an undisclosed fee in November 2004. Morison spent just under two years with Stortford, scoring prolifically, before joining another [[Hertfordshire]] team in the form of [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] for a \"small four-figure fee\" in August 2006.\n\nDuring the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307 season]], Morison scored a total of 34 times in 53 games,<ref name=\"season2006\u201c>{{Soccerbase season|30051|2006}}</ref> including the winner in Stevenage's 3\u20132 victory over [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in the [[FA Trophy]] final in May 2007 \u2013 the first competitive cup final to be held at the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. The following season, Morison netted 22 times in 45 matches, before scoring 30 times during the club's [[2008-09 in English football|2008\u201309 campaign]]; scoring again in Stevenage's 2\u20130 win against [[York City F.C.|York City]] in the FA Trophy final in May 2009, his last game for the club. He joined Millwall for \u00a3130,000 ahead of the [[2009-10 in English football|2009\u201310 season]], and helped the club to promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] by scoring 23 goals in 52 games. He finished as Millwall's top goalscorer [[2010\u201311 Millwall F.C. season|the following season]], before signing for [[Premier League]] side Norwich City for an undisclosed fee in June 2011. In January 2013, Morison signed for Leeds United as part of a swap deal. After just five months at Leeds, Morison rejoined Millwall on a season-long loan in June 2013.\n\nMorison earned eight [[cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national football C team|England C]] team, scoring three goals. In August 2010, Morison made his senior international debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Northampton and Bishop's Stortford===\nBorn in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]],

She was born in [[Tehran]], and was a member of the board of directors at Nature Front Associatio. She has served on the board of directors of The Institute of Celescial Arts of Living. She belongs to a group who are followers of [[Peyman Fattahi]] (known as Master Elia). They are also known as the [[Elyasin community|El-Yasin Community]].\n\nSince 2005, following Fattahi's conventions and lectures, El-Yasin affiliated institutions have faced problems with the Ministry of Intelligence of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} For Najafi, the pressures first appeared in the form of a refusal to authorize her to publish books. Later, books published by her institution were banned from exhibitions and shops. The booth of Taalime-Hagh Publication was closed down at the [[Tehran International Book Fair]] by the security agents (16th International Book Fair - 2005).<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 {{!}} \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644 \u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646 - \u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u0634\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u062d\u0627\u062c \u0646\u062c\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0627\u0634\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc |url=https://ayahra.org/fa/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/4140-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%85-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%81%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF-%D9%88-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C |website=ayahra.org |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>She received a summons, along with a number of other directors of El-Yasin's publications and institutions. She was finally arrested, along with her 26-year-old son, in a planned operation, and both were taken to ward 209 of Evin Prison.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nShe was accused of publishing the book \"[[The Flow of Divine Guidance]]\" which was a collection of lectures by Elia Ramollah (Peyman Fattahi), and its cover design became a charge against him and Mitra Najafi, the editor-in-chief of Taalime-Hagh publication house.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\nShe was released after five months in [[prison]], but her publication office [[license]] was never renewed by the Ministry of [[Culture]] and Islamic Guidance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Release Members of Al-Yasin Society |url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2009/04/alyasin/ |website=Center for Human Rights in Iran |date=2 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Publication activities==\nMitra Haji Najafi began publishing spiritual books by establishing Taalim-e-Hagh (sacred teachings) publication office after joining the El-Yasin Community. She has attended the International Book Fair since 1998 but at the 18th International Book Fair in 2005, the Taalim-e-Hagh booth, which had participated with 14 titles of books, was prevented from attending the exhibition, despite having the exhibitor permit.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Mitra Haji Najafi lodged a complaint against the exhibition authorities, which eventually won the case at the Administrative Justice Court, but her publishing license was never renewed, and since then Taalim-e-Hagh has not been allowed to participate in any book fair.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Negaresh |first1=Hamid |title=Emerging Sects. |publisher=Research Institute of Islam |location=Qom |isbn=9789642461042}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental activities==\nIn 1999, Mitra Haji Najafi established the Nature Front Association, along with a number of other environmental activists, then expanded its activity to protect the environment and [[animals]]. Nature Front Association activities include the shelter construction for [[swan]] and [[migratory birds]] (next to the [[Anzali Port|Anzali Wetland]]) and the creation of a bird garden site in Selke.\nIn 2016, with the arrival of deadly bird flu (avian influenza) in Iran, a book entitled \"Lethal Influenza\" was published by the Nature Front Association. The book warned the possibility of avian influenza virus mutations (it was published in 2006, but the second edition in 2016 did not have permission to be published)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nature |first1=Front |title=Mitra Haji Najafi |url=https://naturefront.org/%d9%85%db%8c%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7-%d8%ad%d8%a7%d8%ac%db%8c-%d9%86%d8%ac%d9%81%db%8c/ |website=Nature Front |publisher=Nature Front Association}}</ref>\n\n==Detention and Imprisonment==\nSince 2003, Mitra Haji Najafi has been repeatedly summoned by Iran's \u201cReligions Bureau\u201d because of her membership at El-Yasin Community and her activities in holding public lectures for Peyman Fattahi.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} \nThis caused the [[Ministry of Islamic Affairs|Ministry of Islamic Culture]] and Guidance to prevent Taalim-e-Hagh from publishing any further books. Later on, those books published by the publication office on her responsibility were confiscated and banned from the bookstores and International Book Fair. The outcome of Haji Najafi's complaint obliged the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance to pay for compensation.

She was born in [[Tehran]], and was a member of the board of directors at Nature Front Associatio. She has served on the board of directors of The Institute of Celescial Arts of Living. She belongs to a group who are followers of [[Peyman Fattahi]] (known as Master Elia). They are also known as the [[Elyasin community|El-Yasin Community]].\n\nSince 2005, following Fattahi's conventions and lectures, El-Yasin affiliated institutions have faced problems with the Ministry of Intelligence of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} For Najafi, the pressures first appeared in the form of a refusal to authorize her to publish books. Later, books published by her institution were banned from exhibitions and shops. The booth of Taalime-Hagh Publication was closed down at the [[Tehran International Book Fair]] by the security agents (16th International Book Fair - 2005).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} She received a summons, along with a number of other directors of El-Yasin's publications and institutions. She was finally arrested, along with her 26-year-old son, in a planned operation, and both were taken to ward 209 of Evin Prison.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nShe was accused of publishing the book \"[[The Flow of Divine Guidance]]\" which was a collection of lectures by Elia Ramollah (Peyman Fattahi), and its cover design became a charge against him and Mitra Najafi, the editor-in-chief of Taalime-Hagh publication house.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\nShe was released after five months in [[prison]], but her publication office [[license]] was never renewed by the Ministry of [[Culture]] and Islamic Guidance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Release Members of Al-Yasin Society |url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2009/04/alyasin/ |website=Center for Human Rights in Iran |date=2 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Publication activities==\nMitra Haji Najafi began publishing spiritual books by establishing Taalim-e-Hagh (sacred teachings) publication office after joining the El-Yasin Community. She has attended the International Book Fair since 1998 but at the 18th International Book Fair in 2005, the Taalim-e-Hagh booth, which had participated with 14 titles of books, was prevented from attending the exhibition, despite having the exhibitor permit.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Mitra Haji Najafi lodged a complaint against the exhibition authorities, which eventually won the case at the Administrative Justice Court, but her publishing license was never renewed, and since then Taalim-e-Hagh has not been allowed to participate in any book fair.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Negaresh |first1=Hamid |title=Emerging Sects. |publisher=Research Institute of Islam |location=Qom |isbn=9789642461042}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental activities==\nIn 1999, Mitra Haji Najafi established the Nature Front Association, along with a number of other environmental activists, then expanded its activity to protect the environment and [[animals]]. Nature Front Association activities include the shelter construction for [[swan]] and [[migratory birds]] (next to the [[Anzali Port|Anzali Wetland]]) and the creation of a bird garden site in Selke.\nIn 2016, with the arrival of deadly bird flu (avian influenza) in Iran, a book entitled \"Lethal Influenza\" was published by the Nature Front Association.

Later on, those books published by the publication office on her responsibility were confiscated and banned from the bookstores and International Book Fair. The outcome of Haji Najafi's complaint obliged the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance to pay for compensation.

Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose \"sons... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him... (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.\"{{sfn|Power|p=4}} Thomas Harvey's portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining-room at Rolls Park, [[Chigwell]], in [[Essex]]. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke. \n\nNotable family connections include [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], who married William's niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir [[Daniel Harvey (diplomat)|Daniel Harvey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} His great nephew was the naval hero [[Eliab Harvey]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.218</ref>\n\n\n===Early life and the University of Padua===\nHarvey's initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned [[Latin]]. He then entered the [[King's School, Canterbury|King's School]] ([[Canterbury]]). Harvey stayed at the King's School for five years, after which he [[matriculated]] at [[Gonville and Caius College]] in [[Cambridge]] in 1593.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597.<ref>{{acad|id=HRVY593W|name=Harvie, William}}</ref> He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the [[University of Padua]], in 1599.\n\nDuring Harvey's years of study there, he developed a relationship with [[Hieronymus Fabricius|Fabricius]] and read Fabricius's ''De Venarum Ostiolis''.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602. Harvey had\n\n<blockquote>\"conducted himself so wonderfully well in the examination and had shown such skill, memory and learning that he had far surpassed even the great hopes which his examiners had formed of him.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=26\u201327}}</blockquote>\n\n===The College of Physicians, marriage and Saint Bartholomew's Hospital===\nAfter graduating from Padua, Harvey immediately returned to England where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the [[University of Cambridge]] that same year, and became a fellow of [[Gonville and Caius College]]. Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the [[Royal College of Physicians]] on 5 October 1604.\n\nA few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, \"daughter of [[Lancelot Browne]] Dr. Physic\" (a medical doctor).{{sfn|Power|p=29}} They had no children.\n\nHarvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the [[Post-nominal letters]] FRCP. He then accepted a position at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St&nbsp;Bartholomew's Hospital]], which enjoined him, \"in God's most holy name\" to \"endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary. And you shall take no gift or reward... for your counsel... This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nHarvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in [[Ludgate]], although two houses in [[West Smithfield]] were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician's function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the subsequent writing of prescriptions.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Lumleian Lecturer===\nThe next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of [[Lumleian lectures|Lumleian lecturer]] on 4 August 1615.<ref>{{cite journal |title=De Motu Cordis: the Lumleian Lecture of 1616: an imagined playlet concerning the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=199\u2013204 |pmid=17404345 |pmc=1847732 |year=2007 |last1=Silverman |first1=M.

He seems to have similarly served various [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]], including [[Francis Bacon|Lord Chancellor Bacon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Harvey|title=William Harvey, English physician|last=Gregory|first=Andrew|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>{{sfn|Power|p=71}} Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him \"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\"{{sfn|Power|p=72}}\n\nIn 1628 he published in [[Frankfurt]] his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the ''[[De Motu Cordis]]''. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey \"fell mightily in his practice\",{{sfn|Power|p=74}} but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Witchcraft trials===\nHarvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life of Harvey|last=Power|first=d'Arcey|publisher=Longmans, Green, & co.|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>''BMJ'' 18 September 1926</ref> Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.<ref>''Selected Writings of Joseph Needham'' ed Mansell Davies</ref>\n\n===Excursions abroad, election as physician to Charles I and the English Civil War===\nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the [[Duke of Lennox]] during his trip abroad. This voyage \u2013 the first after Harvey's return from [[Padua]] \u2013 lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the [[Mantuan War]] and [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. During this journey he wrote to [[Viscount Dorchester]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled [[peace]]. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\".{{sfn|Power|pp=85\u201386}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHaving returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'.  In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion: Richard Lassels and 'The Voyage of Italy' in the Seventeenth Century'' (Geneva-Turin, 1985), pp. 291\u201393.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\"{{sfn|Power|p=125}} During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=D.|date=1946|title=Harvey and the Battle of Edgehill|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=405|pmid=20323936|pmc=1583020}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to [[Oxford]], with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \"Doctor of Physic\" in 1642 and later [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[Merton College]] in 1645. \"In [[Oxford]] he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \"{{sfn|Power|p=130}}\n\n===Harvey's later years, death and burial===\nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=150\u2013151}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHarvey died at [[Roehampton]] in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] from vessels long injured by [[gout]]: it is highly probable that the left [[middle cerebral artery]] malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day.  Harvey\n\n<blockquote>\n\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=166\u2013167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis [[will (law)|will]] distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the [[Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nHarvey was buried in [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\".{{sfn|Power|p=169}} On [[St. Luke's Day]], 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the [[College of Physicians]], and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The [[Royal College of Physicians]], of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882\u20131883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=174\u2013175}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==''De Motu Cordis'' (''Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood'')==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--also, most of this content probably should go into the book article-->\n{{main|Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus}}\n[[Image:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|right|thumb|An experiment from Harvey's ''de Motu Cordis'']]\n\nPublished in 1628 in the city of [[Frankfurt]] (host to an [[Frankfurt Book Fair|annual book fair]] that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus]]'' contains the mature account of the [[pulmonary circulation|circulation of the blood]]. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the [[quarto]] has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]; thus he had to resort to theory {{en dash}} and not practical evidence {{en dash}} in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:\n\n<blockquote>\n \"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and when the [[diastole]] took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\"{{sfn|Power|p=193}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes analyses the [[artery|arteries]], showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the [[left ventricle]], while the contraction of the [[right ventricle]] propels its charge of blood into the [[pulmonary artery]]. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the [[eel]] and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the [[snail]], the [[invisible shrimp]], the [[chicken|chick]] before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead [[pigeon]] and placing upon it a finger wet with [[saliva]], Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Niebaeur |first1=Ashley |title=Chapter 7, Heart failure |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2218/ |website=NCBI|publisher=Remedica |year=2004 }}</ref>\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the [[Ductus arteriosus]] and explained its relative function. Here he says, \"...in [[embryo]]s, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=202\u2013203}} However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the [[vein]]s to the arteries. Coming into conflict with [[Galen]]'s accepted view of the [[liver]] as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each [[Muscle contraction|pump]] of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was {{convert|1.5|impfloz|ml|lk=on}}, and that every time the heart pumps, {{frac|8}} of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about {{convert|1/6|impfloz|ml}} of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.\n\nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand \u2013 which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver \u2013 Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on [[snake|serpents]] and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Billimoria |first1=Aspi |title=Pioneers in Cardiology: William Harvey |url=http://www.japi.org/june_2012/16_pic_william_harvey.html |website=JAPI}}</ref>\n\nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the [[Vein valve|valves of the veins]] discovered by his teacher, [[Hieronymus Fabricius]]. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others \u2013 they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one way flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedland |first1=Gerald |title=Discovery of the function of the heart and circulation of blood |pmc=3721262 }}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of [[capillary|capillaries]]. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \"blood permeates the pores\" in the flesh and it is \"absorbed and imbibed from every part\" by the veins.<ref>As cited in: Douglas Allchin, \"Pseudohistory and Pseudoscience\", ''Science & Education'' 13: 179\u2013195, 2004</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\nHarvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:<blockquote>\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men : still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.\"</blockquote>\nHarvey's premonitions<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science|last=B.

Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nafis]] had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of [[pulmonary circulation]] in his Commentary on Anatomy in [[Avicenna]]'s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1390327 | pmid=17856795 | volume=104 | title=A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD | year=1936 | journal=Ann.

Like bellows, the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nIndependently of Ibn Al-Nafis, [[Michael Servetus]] identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546.<ref>[http://www.michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus</ref> It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed.

The [[Harveian Society of London]] is a medical society founded in 1831 based in The Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, in Cavendish Square. The [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London holds an annual lecture established by William Harvey in 1656 called the [[Harveian Oration]]. The [[Harvey Club of London]] was founded in Canada in 1919 and is based in the [[University of Western Ontario]]. The [[Harvey Society]], found in 1905, is based in New York City and hosts an annual lecture series on recent advances in biomedical sciences.\n\n== Personality ==\nIn terms of his personality, information shows that William Harvey was seen as a \"...humorous but extremely precise man...\",{{sfn|Power|p=145}} how he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from [[insomnia]] (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \"...he could best contemplate\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his [[gout]], here cited completely: \"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\".{{sfn|Power|p=144}} Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of [[bird watching|birds]] during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the \"[[Pile of Boulders]]\" (a small island in Lancashire) and '[[Bass Rock]]' (island off the East Coast of [[Scotland]]).{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:William Harvey ( 1578-1657).jpg|William Harvey\nImage:William Harvey-Foto.jpg | Color portrait\nImage:SS-harvey.jpg | William Harvey, after a painting by [[Cornelius Jansen]]\nImage:William Harvey.jpg| William Harvey\n</gallery>\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |author=Harvey, William |title=On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |year=1889 |url=https://archive.org/details/onmotionheartan00harvgoog|quote=william harvey. }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Harvey, William |author2=Franklin, Kenneth J.

Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose \"sons... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him... (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.\"{{sfn|Power|p=4}} Thomas Harvey's portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining-room at Rolls Park, [[Chigwell]], in [[Essex]]. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke. \n\nNotable family connections include [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], who married William's niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir [[Daniel Harvey (diplomat)|Daniel Harvey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} His great nephew was the naval hero [[Eliab Harvey]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.218</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and the University of Padua===\nHarvey's initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned [[Latin]]. He then entered the [[King's School, Canterbury|King's School]] ([[Canterbury]]). Harvey stayed at the King's School for five years, after which he [[matriculated]] at [[Gonville and Caius College]] in [[Cambridge]] in 1593.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597.<ref>{{acad|id=HRVY593W|name=Harvie, William}}</ref> He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the [[University of Padua]], in 1599.\n\nDuring Harvey's years of study there, he developed a relationship with [[Hieronymus Fabricius|Fabricius]] and read Fabricius's ''De Venarum Ostiolis''.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602. Harvey had\n\n<blockquote>\"conducted himself so wonderfully well in the examination and had shown such skill, memory and learning that he had far surpassed even the great hopes which his examiners had formed of him.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=26\u201327}}</blockquote>\n\n===The College of Physicians, marriage and Saint Bartholomew's Hospital===\nAfter graduating from Padua, Harvey immediately returned to England where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the [[University of Cambridge]] that same year, and became a fellow of [[Gonville and Caius College]]. Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the [[Royal College of Physicians]] on 5 October 1604.\n\nA few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, \"daughter of [[Lancelot Browne]] Dr. Physic\" (a medical doctor).{{sfn|Power|p=29}} They had no children.\n\nHarvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the [[Post-nominal letters]] FRCP. He then accepted a position at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St&nbsp;Bartholomew's Hospital]], which enjoined him, \"in God's most holy name\" to \"endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary. And you shall take no gift or reward... for your counsel... This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nHarvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in [[Ludgate]], although two houses in [[West Smithfield]] were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician's function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the subsequent writing of prescriptions.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Lumleian Lecturer===\nThe next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of [[Lumleian lectures|Lumleian lecturer]] on 4 August 1615.<ref>{{cite journal |title=De Motu Cordis: the Lumleian Lecture of 1616: an imagined playlet concerning the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=199\u2013204 |pmid=17404345 |pmc=1847732 |year=2007 |last1=Silverman |first1=M.

He seems to have similarly served various [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]], including [[Francis Bacon|Lord Chancellor Bacon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Harvey|title=William Harvey, English physician|last=Gregory|first=Andrew|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>{{sfn|Power|p=71}} Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him \"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\"{{sfn|Power|p=72}}\n\nIn 1628 he published in [[Frankfurt]] his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the ''[[De Motu Cordis]]''. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey \"fell mightily in his practice\",{{sfn|Power|p=74}} but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Witchcraft trials===\nHarvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life of Harvey|last=Power|first=d'Arcey|publisher=Longmans, Green, & co.|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>''BMJ'' 18 September 1926</ref> Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.<ref>''Selected Writings of Joseph Needham'' ed Mansell Davies</ref>\n\n===Excursions abroad, election as physician to Charles I and the English Civil War===\nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the [[Duke of Lennox]] during his trip abroad. This voyage \u2013 the first after Harvey's return from [[Padua]] \u2013 lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the [[Mantuan War]] and [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. During this journey he wrote to [[Viscount Dorchester]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled [[peace]]. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\".{{sfn|Power|pp=85\u201386}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHaving returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'.  In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion: Richard Lassels and 'The Voyage of Italy' in the Seventeenth Century'' (Geneva-Turin, 1985), pp. 291\u201393.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\"{{sfn|Power|p=125}} During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=D.|date=1946|title=Harvey and the Battle of Edgehill|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=405|pmid=20323936|pmc=1583020}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to [[Oxford]], with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \"Doctor of Physic\" in 1642 and later [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[Merton College]] in 1645. \"In [[Oxford]] he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \"{{sfn|Power|p=130}}\n\n===Harvey's later years, death and burial===\nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=150\u2013151}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHarvey died at [[Roehampton]] in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] from vessels long injured by [[gout]]: it is highly probable that the left [[middle cerebral artery]] malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day.  Harvey\n\n<blockquote>\n\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=166\u2013167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis [[will (law)|will]] distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the [[Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nHarvey was buried in [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\".{{sfn|Power|p=169}} On [[St. Luke's Day]], 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the [[College of Physicians]], and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The [[Royal College of Physicians]], of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882\u20131883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=174\u2013175}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==''De Motu Cordis'' (''Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood'')==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--also, most of this content probably should go into the book article-->\n{{main|Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus}}\n[[Image:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|right|thumb|An experiment from Harvey's ''de Motu Cordis'']]\n\nPublished in 1628 in the city of [[Frankfurt]] (host to an [[Frankfurt Book Fair|annual book fair]] that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus]]'' contains the mature account of the [[pulmonary circulation|circulation of the blood]]. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the [[quarto]] has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]; thus he had to resort to theory {{en dash}} and not practical evidence {{en dash}} in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:\n\n<blockquote>\n \"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and when the [[diastole]] took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\"{{sfn|Power|p=193}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes analyses the [[artery|arteries]], showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the [[left ventricle]], while the contraction of the [[right ventricle]] propels its charge of blood into the [[pulmonary artery]]. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the [[eel]] and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the [[snail]], the [[invisible shrimp]], the [[chicken|chick]] before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead [[pigeon]] and placing upon it a finger wet with [[saliva]], Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Niebaeur |first1=Ashley |title=Chapter 7, Heart failure |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2218/ |website=NCBI|publisher=Remedica |year=2004 }}</ref>\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the [[Ductus arteriosus]] and explained its relative function. Here he says, \"...in [[embryo]]s, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=202\u2013203}} However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the [[vein]]s to the arteries. Coming into conflict with [[Galen]]'s accepted view of the [[liver]] as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each [[Muscle contraction|pump]] of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was {{convert|1.5|impfloz|ml|lk=on}}, and that every time the heart pumps, {{frac|8}} of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about {{convert|1/6|impfloz|ml}} of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.\n\nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand \u2013 which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver \u2013 Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on [[snake|serpents]] and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Billimoria |first1=Aspi |title=Pioneers in Cardiology: William Harvey |url=http://www.japi.org/june_2012/16_pic_william_harvey.html |website=JAPI}}</ref>\n\nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the [[Vein valve|valves of the veins]] discovered by his teacher, [[Hieronymus Fabricius]]. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others \u2013 they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one way flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedland |first1=Gerald |title=Discovery of the function of the heart and circulation of blood |pmc=3721262 }}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of [[capillary|capillaries]]. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \"blood permeates the pores\" in the flesh and it is \"absorbed and imbibed from every part\" by the veins.<ref>As cited in: Douglas Allchin, \"Pseudohistory and Pseudoscience\", ''Science & Education'' 13: 179\u2013195, 2004</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\nHarvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:<blockquote>\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men : still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.\"</blockquote>\nHarvey's premonitions<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science|last=B.

Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nafis]] had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of [[pulmonary circulation]] in his Commentary on Anatomy in [[Avicenna]]'s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1390327 | pmid=17856795 | volume=104 | title=A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD | year=1936 | journal=Ann.

Like bellows, the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nIndependently of Ibn Al-Nafis, [[Michael Servetus]] identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546.<ref>[http://www.michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus</ref> It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed. In: ''Christianismi Restitutio'', Book V, the Aragonese Miguel Servet (Michel de Villeneuve, 1509?\u20131553) wrote: 'The blood is passed through the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein for a lengthy pass through the lungs, during which it becomes red, and gets rid of the sooty fumes by the act of exhalation'.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nPulmonary circulation was described by [[Renaldus Columbus]], [[Andrea Cesalpino]] and [[Vesalius]], before Harvey would provide a refined and complete description of the circulatory system.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==''On Animal Generation''==\nHarvey's other major work was ''Exercitationes de generatione animalium'' (''On Animal Generation''), published in 1651.

The major part is theoretical, dealing with [[Aristotle]]'s theories and the work of the physicians following [[Galen]] and up to Fabricius.

The [[Harveian Society of London]] is a medical society founded in 1831 based in The Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, in Cavendish Square. The [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London holds an annual lecture established by William Harvey in 1656 called the [[Harveian Oration]]. The [[Harvey Club of London]] was founded in Canada in 1919 and is based in the [[University of Western Ontario]]. The [[Harvey Society]], found in 1905, is based in New York City and hosts an annual lecture series on recent advances in biomedical sciences.\n\n== Personality ==\nIn terms of his personality, information shows that William Harvey was seen as a \"...humorous but extremely precise man...\",{{sfn|Power|p=145}} how he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from [[insomnia]] (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \"...he could best contemplate\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his [[gout]], here cited completely: \"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\".{{sfn|Power|p=144}} Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of [[bird watching|birds]] during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the \"[[Pile of Boulders]]\" (a small island in Lancashire) and '[[Bass Rock]]' (island off the East Coast of [[Scotland]]).{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:William Harvey ( 1578-1657).jpg|William Harvey\nImage:William Harvey-Foto.jpg | Color portrait\nImage:SS-harvey.jpg | William Harvey, after a painting by [[Cornelius Jansen]]\nImage:William Harvey.jpg| William Harvey\n</gallery>\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |author=Harvey, William |title=On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |year=1889 |url=https://archive.org/details/onmotionheartan00harvgoog|quote=william harvey. }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Harvey, William |author2=Franklin, Kenneth J.

Chromium metal was first shown to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|French Academy]] by [[Louis Vauquelin|Vauquelin]] in 1798. In the early 1800s, Stodart, Faraday, and Mallet observed the resistance of chromium-iron alloys (\"chromium steels\") to [[oxidizing agents]].

The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

Grade EN 1.4303 (Casting grade CA6NM) with 13% Cr and 4% Ni is used for most [[Pelton wheel|Pelton]], [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] and [[Francis turbine]]s in [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]]<nowiki/>s <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|title=Stainless teel in Micro Hydro turbines|publisher=International Stainless Steel Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010101/http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018}}</ref> because it has good casting properties, a good weldability and a good resistance to [[cavitation]] erosion.\n# Precipitation hardening grades: Grade EN 1.4542 (a.k.a. 17/4PH), the best known grade, combines martensitic hardening and precipitation hardening.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432). Because stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat, it is often used as a thin surface cladding over a core of copper or aluminium, which conduct heat more readily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCutlery is normally stainless steel,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QzJDRxLLxNIC&pg=PA240&dq=Cutlery+is+normally+stainless+steel#v=onepage&q=Cutlery%20is%20normally%20stainless%20steel&f=false|title=Stainless Steels for Design Engineers|last=McGuire|first=Michael F.|date=2008|publisher=ASM International|isbn=9781615030590|language=en}}</ref> for low corrosion, ease of cleaning, negligible toxicity, as well as not flavoring the food by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catra.org/pages/products/sharpening/careof.htm|title=care of cutlery|website=www.catra.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> [[Standard electrode potential|electrolytic activity]].\n\n===Jewelry===\n\nStainless steel is used for jewelry and watches, with 316L being the type commonly used for such applications.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The interest rate comes in as a way of  bringing expenses  made in different years to their present value (a method widely used by banks and insurance companies) so they can be added and compared fairly\n\n'''Application of LCC in materials selection'''\n\nStainless steel used in projects often results in lower LCC values compared to other materials, because the higher acquisition cost (AC) of stainless steel components are often offset by improvements in operating and maintenance costs, through reduced loss of production (LP) costs, and by the improved resale value of stainless steel components.{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n\nThe LCC calculations are usually limited to the project itself. However, there may be other costs that a community wants to consider as well:{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n* utilities, such as power plants, water supply & wastewater treatment, hospitals, \u2026 cannot be shut down.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

It only absorbs a small amount of carbon because of its cubic crystalline structure, which consists of one iron in each corner and a central iron atom; the central atom is what gives it magnetic properties. \n\nGrades with low coercitive field Hc have been developed for electrovalves used in household appliances  and for injection systems in internal combustion engines\n\nAnnealed [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steels are usually [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|non-magnetic]].   \n\nSome applications require non-magnetic materials, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Magnetic permeability of some austenitic  stainless steel grades after annealing 2 hours at 1050{{nbsp}}\u00b0C<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fofanov|first=D.|url=|title=Magnetic properties of Stainless Steels: applications, opportunities and new developments|date=29 Nov 2011|work=Stainless steel World Conference|access-date=|last2=Riedner|first2=S.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432).

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Built in 1444, it was colonial Europe's first slave market]]\nLagos is an ancient maritime town with more than 2000 years of history. The name ''Lagos'' comes from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] settlement, derived from the Latin ''[[Lacobriga]]'', the name of the settlement was established during the pre-[[Punics|Punic]] civilizations. It became an early settlement of the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], who recruited Celtic tribesmen in their war against the Romans (the [[Punic Wars]]). Owing to its already important harbour, it was colonized by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and integrated into the Roman province of [[Lusitania]], becoming known as Lacobriga. [[Quintus Sertorius]], a rebellious Roman general, helped by the Lusitanians of Lacobriga (who had been oppressed under Roman Generals and members of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] party), successfully defeated the Roman army of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Caecilius Metellus Pius]] probably at nearby [[Monte Moli\u00e3o]].\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the town of Lagos was occupied in the 6th century by the [[Visigoths]] from the [[Visigoths#Kingdom of Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]] and later by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].\n\nThe [[Moors]] arrived in the 8th century from North Africa, renaming the settlement ''Zawaia'' (meaning ''lago'', or ''lake'').  It became part of the much larger coastal region of ''al-Gharb'', which eventually became known as the ''algarve''. The Moors fortified the town  with [[Lagos Castle]] and established important trade links to Northern Africa from their bases in the Iberian peninsula. In 1174, the local [[W\u0101li]] gave permission for the Christian peoples to construct a church dedicated to S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista, which was built outside the town's walls (becoming the oldest church in the Algarve).\n\n===Kingdom===\nEven as King [[Afonso Henriques]] advanced to the south, the Christian [[Reconquista]] never made it into Algarve and Alentejo, and remained under Moorish control. King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], with the support of Crusader forces used Lagos as a stepping stone to attack the fortress of Alv\u00f4r.<ref>\nCUP (1970), p.95</ref> Zawaia was eventually captured by King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] in 1241, but was only taken definitively in 1249. From this period on the King began self-styling himself as the ''\"King of Portugal and the Algarve\"'', stressing the fact that the Algarve (which had for so long been ruled by the Moors as a foreign country) had been annexed into the dominion of the Portuguese.\nLagos became an independent jurisdiction under the rule of King [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]] in 1361.\n\nKing [[John I of Portugal|John I]] assembled his fleet in the harbour of Lagos, before setting sail for the siege and [[Conquest of Ceuta|conquest of the city of Ceuta]] in 1415. This was the first step in opening the Muslim world to medieval Europe, which in fact led to the [[Age of Discovery]] with Portuguese explorers sailing across the whole world. By the 15th century, Lagos became the centre of Portuguese maritime exploration, with ships ordered south to trace the shoreline of Africa in order to find routes to India. [[Infante]] [[Henry the Navigator]], third son of King John, lived most of the time in Lagos. From here he directed expeditions to [[Morocco]] and to the western coast of [[Africa]] with [[caravel]]s, [[lateen]]-rigged ships with excellent seafaring capabilities. Lagos was also the home port for [[Gil Eanes]] who was the first to sail beyond [[Cape Bojador]] in 1434, after a failed attempt in 1433 that put him out of favour with the, then considered the end of the world. The act of rounding the Cape, much like the later rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], permitted Eanes (and the navigators that followed) to advance into the African subcontinent. When, by 1443, Lan\u00e7arote (then fiscal officer of the crown) had sailed as far as [[Arguim]] and brought back 275 Africans, the Portuguese had sufficient slaves to relieve the perpetual handicap of agricultural labour.<ref>CUP (1970), p.190</ref>\n\nOver the following decades, news of discoveries and achievements, and ships loaded with spices and goods would flow into the port of Lagos.  It was also the gateway for the first African [[slave]]s into post-medieval Europe.<ref name=\"H. Morse Stephens 1891, p.149\">H.

Morse Stephens 1891, p.149\"/> As the major sponsor of these expeditions, Prince Henry received one-fifth of the selling price of every slave. The demand for the indentured labour force was so high that, by 1450, profit on [[Mauritania]]n slaves was 700 percent.<ref>David Birmingham (2003), p. 29</ref>  The discovery of gold by Alfonso Gon\u00e7ales also increased activities in Lagos, whose residents petitioned the Infante Henry to establish a trading company to pursue gold deposits in the region.<ref name=\"Kerr1\">Robert Kerr (1844), p.189</ref> This included Juan Dias (ancestor of [[Bartolomeu Dias]] who rounded the Cape of Good Hope), [[Gil Eanes]], [[Lan\u00e7arote de Freitas]], Estevan Alfonso and Rodrigo Alvarez, who provisioned a squadron of six caravels to travel to isle of Gar\u00e7as in 1444, but returned with 150 Africans.<ref name=Kerr1/>\n[[File:Centro_de_Lagos.png|thumb|235px|right|The historic centre of Lagos]]\nFollowing the death of Prince Henry, and the expansion into the Atlantic and New World, the port of Lagos continued to receive shipments of goods and slaves, but its role began to decrease. Lisbon, began to prosper, with ships returning directly from the colonies of the Azores, Madeira and Brazil, while trading houses began to relocate to the capital. But, even as the wealth arrived in Lisbon and Lagos, the ostentation was widely on display in the royal residences.<ref>David Birmingham (2003), p. 30</ref>\n\nKing [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]], obsessed with his plans for a great crusade against the [[Kingdom of Fez]], assembled a huge fleet in Lagos in 1578.<ref>H. Morse Stephens (1891), p.253</ref> During this ill-fated attempt he and most of Portugal's nobility were killed in the [[Battle of Ksar El Kebir]] in Morocco, eventually causing a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|succession crisis]], that eventually resulted in the [[Iberian Union]].\n\nWhen Portugal came under Spanish rule, the Portuguese coast became a target for the English fleet.  Lagos, close to the Spanish naval base of [[C\u00e1diz]], was attacked by Sir [[Francis Drake]] in the late 1580s, but was defended by its inhabitants, resulting in Drakes sack of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].<ref>CUP (1970), p.275</ref> But, the coast was under regular attack of other [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]], in addition to the Spanish who bombarded the Algarve during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] (1640\u20131668), which led to the construction of a string of forts all along the coast. One of them was the late-17th-century ''Ponta da Bandeira Fort'' in Lagos, which was completed between 1679 and 1690 (according to the stone inscription over the main door).\n\nFrom 1576 to 1755, Lagos was a high-profile capital of the Algarve, until the old Portuguese town was destroyed by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake and tsunami of 1755]]. Although some walls from the 16th century still remain, as well as the governor's [[castle]], many of the buildings are from the 17th century.\n\nTwo well-known naval battles took place off Lagos, reflecting its strategic location: in the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)]] a French flotilla defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch force, while in the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)]] a British force defeated a French force.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Dona Ana beach, Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|235px|''Dona Ana Beach (Praia Dona Ana)'']]\n[[File:Praia_do_Pinh\u00e3o.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Pinh\u00e3o beach]]\n[[File:Praia do Porto de M\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Porto de M\u00f3s beach (Praia do Porto de M\u00f3s) is one of the most popular beaches in Lagos, along with Dona Ana and Meia Praia]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nBy its geographical position (east-northeast to west-southwest orientation) and lithological diversity, the Algarve stands out as a unique [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] and [[Morphotectonics|morpho-tectonic]] region.<ref name=\"Episodes\">M.

Built in 1444, it was colonial Europe's first slave market]]\nLagos is an ancient maritime town with more than 2000 years of history. The name ''Lagos'' comes from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] settlement, derived from the Latin ''[[Lacobriga]]'', the name of the settlement was established during the pre-[[Punics|Punic]] civilizations. It became an early settlement of the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], who recruited Celtic tribesmen in their war against the Romans (the [[Punic Wars]]). Owing to its already important harbour, it was colonized by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and integrated into the Roman province of [[Lusitania]], becoming known as Lacobriga. [[Quintus Sertorius]], a rebellious Roman general, helped by the Lusitanians of Lacobriga (who had been oppressed under Roman Generals and members of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] party), successfully defeated the Roman army of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Caecilius Metellus Pius]] probably at nearby [[Monte Moli\u00e3o]].\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the town of Lagos was occupied in the 6th century by the [[Visigoths]] from the [[Visigoths#Kingdom of Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]] and later by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].\n\nThe [[Moors]] arrived in the 8th century from North Africa, renaming the settlement ''Zawaia'' (meaning ''lago'', or ''lake'').  It became part of the much larger coastal region of ''al-Gharb'', which eventually became known as the ''algarve''. The Moors fortified the town  with [[Lagos Castle]] and established important trade links to Northern Africa from their bases in the Iberian peninsula. In 1174, the local [[W\u0101li]] gave permission for the Christian peoples to construct a church dedicated to S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista, which was built outside the town's walls (becoming the oldest church in the Algarve).\n\n===Kingdom===\nEven as King [[Afonso Henriques]] advanced to the south, the Christian [[Reconquista]] never made it into Algarve and Alentejo, and remained under Moorish control. King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], with the support of Crusader forces used Lagos as a stepping stone to attack the fortress of Alv\u00f4r.<ref>\nCUP (1970), p.95</ref> Zawaia was eventually captured by King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] in 1241, but was only taken definitively in 1249. From this period on the King began self-styling himself as the ''\"King of Portugal and the Algarve\"'', stressing the fact that the Algarve (which had for so long been ruled by the Moors as a foreign country) had been annexed into the dominion of the Portuguese.\nLagos became an independent jurisdiction under the rule of King [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]] in 1361.\n\nKing [[John I of Portugal|John I]] assembled his fleet in the harbour of Lagos, before setting sail for the siege and [[Conquest of Ceuta|conquest of the city of Ceuta]] in 1415. This was the first step in opening the Muslim world to medieval Europe, which in fact led to the [[Age of Discovery]] with Portuguese explorers sailing across the whole world. By the 15th century, Lagos became the centre of Portuguese maritime exploration, with ships ordered south to trace the shoreline of Africa in order to find routes to India. [[Infante]] [[Henry the Navigator]], third son of King John, lived most of the time in Lagos. From here he directed expeditions to [[Morocco]] and to the western coast of [[Africa]] with [[caravel]]s, [[lateen]]-rigged ships with excellent seafaring capabilities. Lagos was also the home port for [[Gil Eanes]] who was the first to sail beyond [[Cape Bojador]] in 1434, after a failed attempt in 1433 that put him out of favour with the, then considered the end of the world. The act of rounding the Cape, much like the later rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], permitted Eanes (and the navigators that followed) to advance into the African subcontinent. When, by 1443, Lan\u00e7arote (then fiscal officer of the crown) had sailed as far as [[Arguim]] and brought back 275 Africans, the Portuguese had sufficient slaves to relieve the perpetual handicap of agricultural labour.<ref>CUP (1970), p.190</ref>\n\nOver the following decades, news of discoveries and achievements, and ships loaded with spices and goods would flow into the port of Lagos.  It was also the gateway for the first African [[slave]]s into post-medieval Europe.<ref name=\"H. Morse Stephens 1891, p.149\">H.

Morse Stephens 1891, p.149\"/> As the major sponsor of these expeditions, Prince Henry received one-fifth of the selling price of every slave. The demand for the indentured labour force was so high that, by 1450, profit on [[Mauritania]]n slaves was 700 percent.<ref>David Birmingham (2003), p. 29</ref>  The discovery of gold by Alfonso Gon\u00e7ales also increased activities in Lagos, whose residents petitioned the Infante Henry to establish a trading company to pursue gold deposits in the region.<ref name=\"Kerr1\">Robert Kerr (1844), p.189</ref> This included Juan Dias (ancestor of [[Bartolomeu Dias]] who rounded the Cape of Good Hope), [[Gil Eanes]], [[Lan\u00e7arote de Freitas]], Estevan Alfonso and Rodrigo Alvarez, who provisioned a squadron of six caravels to travel to isle of Gar\u00e7as in 1444, but returned with 150 Africans.<ref name=Kerr1/>\n[[File:Centro_de_Lagos.png|thumb|235px|right|The historic centre of Lagos]]\nFollowing the death of Prince Henry, and the expansion into the Atlantic and New World, the port of Lagos continued to receive shipments of goods and slaves, but its role began to decrease. Lisbon, began to prosper, with ships returning directly from the colonies of the Azores, Madeira and Brazil, while trading houses began to relocate to the capital. But, even as the wealth arrived in Lisbon and Lagos, the ostentation was widely on display in the royal residences.<ref>David Birmingham (2003), p. 30</ref>\n\nKing [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]], obsessed with his plans for a great crusade against the [[Kingdom of Fez]], assembled a huge fleet in Lagos in 1578.<ref>H. Morse Stephens (1891), p.253</ref> During this ill-fated attempt he and most of Portugal's nobility were killed in the [[Battle of Ksar El Kebir]] in Morocco, eventually causing a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|succession crisis]], that eventually resulted in the [[Iberian Union]].\n\nWhen Portugal came under Spanish rule, the Portuguese coast became a target for the English fleet.  Lagos, close to the Spanish naval base of [[C\u00e1diz]], was attacked by Sir [[Francis Drake]] in the late 1580s, but was defended by its inhabitants, resulting in Drakes sack of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].<ref>CUP (1970), p.275</ref> But, the coast was under regular attack of other [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]], in addition to the Spanish who bombarded the Algarve during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] (1640\u20131668), which led to the construction of a string of forts all along the coast. One of them was the late-17th-century ''Ponta da Bandeira Fort'' in Lagos, which was completed between 1679 and 1690 (according to the stone inscription over the main door).\n\nFrom 1576 to 1755, Lagos was a high-profile capital of the Algarve, until the old Portuguese town was destroyed by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake and tsunami of 1755]]. Although some walls from the 16th century still remain, as well as the governor's [[castle]], many of the buildings are from the 17th century.\n\nTwo well-known naval battles took place off Lagos, reflecting its strategic location: in the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)]] a French flotilla defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch force, while in the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)]] a British force defeated a French force.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Dona Ana beach, Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|235px|''Dona Ana Beach (Praia Dona Ana)'']]\n[[File:Praia_do_Pinh\u00e3o.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Pinh\u00e3o beach]]\n[[File:Praia do Porto de M\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Porto de M\u00f3s beach (Praia do Porto de M\u00f3s) is one of the most popular beaches in Lagos, along with Dona Ana and Meia Praia]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nBy its geographical position (east-northeast to west-southwest orientation) and lithological diversity, the Algarve stands out as a unique [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] and [[Morphotectonics|morpho-tectonic]] region.<ref name=\"Episodes\">M.

McCandless travels into the wilderness and sets up a campsite in an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned city bus]], which he calls \"The Magic Bus.\" At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild.\n\nTwo years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from [[Emory University]]. Shortly afterwards, he rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to [[Oxfam]] and sets out on a cross-country drive in his [[Nissan Sunny#B210 (1973\u20131977)|Datsun 210]] to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt and Billie McCandless, or his sister Carine what he is doing or where he is going. He refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.\n\nAt [[Lake Mead]], McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: \"Alexander Supertramp.\" In [[Northern California]], McCandless encounters a [[hippie]] couple named Jan Burres and Rainey. Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in [[Carthage, South Dakota]] and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg. He is forced to leave after Westerberg is arrested for [[satellite piracy]].\n\nMcCandless then travels on the [[Colorado River]] and, though told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he eventually arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he travels on freight trains to [[Los Angeles]]. Not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling \"corrupted\" by modern civilization and decides to leave. Later, he is forced to resume hitchhiking, after being beaten by [[Railroad police#United States|railroad police]].\n\nIn December 1991, McCandless arrives at [[Slab City, California|Slab City]], in the [[Imperial Valley]], and encounters Jan and Rainey again. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro, a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to continue heading for Alaska. One month later, camping near [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], McCandless encounters Ron Franz, a retired man who recounts the story of the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the [[United States Army]]. He now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska, despite this upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a parting note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but McCandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from Alaska.\n\nFour months later, at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he makes several poor decisions. As his supplies dwindle, he realizes that nature is harsh and uncaring. McCandless concludes that true happiness can be found only when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the snow thaw, and he is unable to cross. Saddened, he returns to the bus. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. He confuses similar plants and eats a poisonous one, falling sick as a result. Slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self-realization and imagines what it might have looked like if he had managed to return to his family. He writes a farewell letter to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. \n\nAn epilogue states that two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returns to Virginia with her brother's ashes in her backpack.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 0632.JPG|thumb|320px|[[Salvation Mountain]] where Chris and Tracy took a walk.]] -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Chris McCandless]] a.k.a.

Noting McCandless' unpreparedness, the stranger who drops him off gives him a pair of gumboots. McCandless travels into the wilderness and sets up a campsite in an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned city bus]], which he calls \"The Magic Bus.\" At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild.\n\nTwo years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from [[Emory University]]. Shortly afterwards, he rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to [[Oxfam]] and sets out on a cross-country drive in his [[Nissan Sunny#B210 (1973\u20131977)|Datsun 210]] to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt and Billie McCandless, or his sister Carine what he is doing or where he is going. He refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.\n\nAt [[Lake Mead]], McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: \"Alexander Supertramp.\" In [[Northern California]], McCandless encounters a [[hippie]] couple named Jan Burres and Rainey. Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in [[Carthage, South Dakota]] and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg. He is forced to leave after Westerberg is arrested for [[satellite piracy]].\n\nMcCandless then travels on the [[Colorado River]] and, though told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he eventually arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he travels on freight trains to [[Los Angeles]]. Not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling \"corrupted\" by modern civilization and decides to leave. Later, he is forced to resume hitchhiking, after being beaten by [[Railroad police#United States|railroad police]].\n\nIn December 1991, McCandless arrives at [[Slab City, California|Slab City]], in the [[Imperial Valley]], and encounters Jan and Rainey again. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro, a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to continue heading for Alaska. One month later, camping near [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], McCandless encounters Ron Franz, a retired man who recounts the story of the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the [[United States Army]]. He now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska, despite this upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a parting note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but McCandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from Alaska.\n\nFour months later, at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he makes several poor decisions. As his supplies dwindle, he realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. McCandless concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the snow thaw, and he is unable to cross. Saddened, he returns to the bus. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. He confuses similar plants and eats a poisonous one, falling sick as a result. Slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self-realization and imagines what it might have looked like if he had managed to return to his family. He writes a farewell letter to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. \n\nAn epilogue states that two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returns to Virginia with her brother's ashes in her backpack.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 0632.JPG|thumb|320px|[[Salvation Mountain]] where Chris and Tracy took a walk.]] -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Chris McCandless]] a.k.a.
