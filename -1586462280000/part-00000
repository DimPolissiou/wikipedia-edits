It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop.

Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, [[Tech trance]] is a mixture of trance and techno, and [[Vocal trance]] \"combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music\".<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> The [[dream trance]] genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by [[Robert Miles]].\n\n[[AllMusic]] states on progressive trance: \"the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound, since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place.

This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies.

These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol.

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting.

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.\n\nThe use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan & Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&pg=PA144|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You\u2019re Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"condry_59\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.<ref name=\"condry_59\">{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&pg=PA59|page=60}}</ref> \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]\" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&nbsp;\u2013 and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''<ref name=\"wire_2002\">{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221\u2013226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> [[Video game music|video game sounds]].<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\"/> ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].<ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.<ref name=\"rockin\">''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140\u2013141]{{Better source|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:\u771f\u934b\u3061\u3048\u307f|Chiemi Manabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe \u2013 \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u30fb\u5c11\u5973|website=Discogs}}</ref> and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System \u2013 Orient Express|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 1980s===\n{{See also|New school hip hop|Miami bass|Freestyle music|Hip house|Latin house|Industrial dance music}}\n\nThe emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly those from the Japanese [[Roland Corporation]].

This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of [[UK garage]], drawing on a lineage of related styles such as [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[dub reggae]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]],  [[broken beat]], and [[grime (music genre)|grime]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic \u2013 Dubstep] \"Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub\"</ref><ref name=Reynolds>Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages&nbsp;511\u2013516, ({{ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4}}).</ref> In the United Kingdom the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.<ref name=Reynolds /><ref>[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown], [[New Musical Express]], 21 February 1981, {{ISSN|0028-6362}}.</ref>\n\nThe earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as [[B-side]]s of [[2-step garage]] single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]]. This setup is generally sufficient to complete entire productions, which are then ready for [[audio mastering|mastering]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Richard James|title=The History of Music Production|date=2014|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0199357161|pages=136\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Ghost production===\nA ghost producer is a hired music producer in a business arrangement who produces a song for another DJ/artist that releases it as their own,<ref name=\"YDM\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youredm.com/2018/06/04/the-unspoken-side-of-ghost-producers/ |title=The Unspoken Side Of Ghost Producers |date=2018-06-04 |website=Your EDM |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> typically under a contract which prevents them from identifying themselves as a personnel of the song.<ref name=\"mm\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.magneticmag.com/2015/09/what-exactly-does-ghost-producer-mean/ |title=What Exactly Does \"Ghost Producer\" Mean? |website=Magnetic Magazine |language=en-us |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> Ghost producers receive a simple fee or royalty payments for their work and are often able to work in their preference of not having the intense pressure of fame and the lifestyle of an internationally recognized DJ.<ref name=\"YDM\"/> A ghost producer may increase their notability in the music industry by acquainting with established \"big name\" DJs and producers.<ref name=\"YDM\"/> Producers like [[Martin Garrix]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> and [[Porter Robinson]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> are often noted for their ghost production work for other producers while [[David Guetta]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> and [[Steve Aoki]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> are noted for their usage of ghost producers in their songs whereas DJs like [[Ti\u00ebsto]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> have been openly crediting their producers in an attempt to avoid censure and for transparency.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/3dyx73/dance-musics-dirty-little-secret-isnt-that-big-of-a-deal |title=Dance Music's \"Dirty Little Secret\" Isn't That Big of a Deal |date=2014-05-01 |website=Thump |language=en-us |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref>\n\nMany ghost producers sign agreements that prevent them from working for anyone else or establishing themselves as a solo artist.<ref name=\"LAW\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/ghost-producing-is-edms-dirty-little-secret-4170623 |title=\"Ghost-Producing\" Is EDM's Dirty Little Secret |last=Khawaja |first=Jemayel |date=2013-07-29 |website=L.A.

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, \"Death\" or \"Dr. Death\", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.
