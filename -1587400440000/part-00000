Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|Napoleonic Wars]], while historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nFrom the outbreak of war with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain [[impressment|pressed]] American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake\u2013Leopard'' affair]], which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the [[Little Belt affair|''Little Belt'' affair]] in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.{{sfn|Stagg|1983|p=4}} Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of [[British North America]] (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President [[James Madison]] signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.{{sfn|Woodworth|1812}}\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting [[Napoleon]], Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier along with help from Native American allies. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|its unpopularity]], especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the [[Siege of Detroit]] and the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] thwarted attempts to seize [[Upper Canada]], improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade [[Lower Canada]] and capture [[Montreal]]. In 1813, the Americans won the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], gaining control of the lake, and they defeated [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of the Thames]], defeating the largest Native ally of Britain and securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids [[Burning of Washington|burned the capital]], but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invade New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Maryland]], ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans [[Battle of New Orleans|decisively defeated]] the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in [[Spanish Florida]]; a [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|two-day battle]] for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.{{sfn|Heidler|p=45}}\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|abdication of Napoleon]], Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment generally. This made moot the issue of American sailor impressment, and removed one of the original causes of the war. The British were then able to increase the strength of their blockade of the United States coast. Attempts to smother American maritime trade failed, however, at which point both sides began to desire peace.{{sfn|Fowler|2017|pages=23\u201324}}\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.{{sfn|order of the Senate of the United States|1828|pages=619\u2013620}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origins of the War of 1812}}\nHistorians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying the origin of the War of 1812. This section summarizes several contributing factors which resulted in the declaration of war by the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Trautsch|1y=2013|1pp=273\u2013293|2a1=Egan|2y=1974|3a1=Goodman|3y=1941|3pp=171\u2013186}}{{sfn| Silverstone |2004|page=95}}\n\n===Honour and the second war of independence===\nAs Risjord (1961) notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults, such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]].{{sfn|Risjord|1961|pp=196\u2013210}} [[H. W. Brands]] writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=163}} Americans at the time and historians since{{sfn|Swanson |1945}} have often called it the United States' \"Second War of Independence\".{{sfn|Hickey|2013}}\n\nThe British, at the same time, were offended by what they considered insults, such as the [[Little Belt affair|\"Little Belt\" affair]]. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the United States flagship ''President'', which they succeeded in doing in 1815.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\n===Impressment and naval actions===\nIn 1807, Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]] to impede neutral trade with France, whom Britain was fighting in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.{{sfn|Fanis|2011|p=94}} Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\"{{sfn|Horsman|1962|p=264}} The American merchant marine had nearly doubled between 1802 and 1810, making it by far the largest neutral fleet. Britain was the largest trading partner, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of other American exports, and the British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=281}} The United States' view was that Britain's restrictions violated its right to trade with others.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy expanded to 176 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and 600 ships overall, requiring 140,000 sailors to man them.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=382}} The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but it competed in wartime with merchant shipping and privateers for a small pool of experienced sailors, so it  turned to [[impressment]] from ashore and from foreign and domestic shipping when it could not operate its ships with volunteers alone.\n\nThe United States believed that British deserters had a right to become American citizens, but Britain did not recognize a right whereby a British subject could relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The British Navy, therefore, considered any American citizen liable for impressment if he was born British. Aggravating the situation was the United States' reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers, and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or [[protection papers]] among sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|pages=565\u2013566}} This made it difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non-Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British. Some gained freedom on appeal.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=17}} The Admiralty estimated that there were 11,000 naturalized sailors on United States ships in 1805, and US Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] stated that 9,000 US sailors had been born in Great Britain or Ireland.{{sfn|Caffrey|1977|p=60}} Captain [[Isaac Chauncey]] found in 1808 that 58-percent of sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants. Of these 150 naturalized sailors, 80 were from Ireland and 54 from other parts of the United Kingdom.\n[[File:Story of one hundred years - A comprehensive review of the political and military events, the social, intellectual and material progress, and the general state of mankind in all lands.

The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]] and other acts of impressment angered the American public.]]\nAmerican anger grew when British frigates were stationed just outside US harbours and in view of US shores to search ships and impress men while within US territorial waters.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=278\u2013279}} Well-publicized impressment actions outraged the American public, such as the [[Leander affair|''Leander'' affair]] and the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]].{{sfn|Black|2002|p=44}}{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe British public were outraged in their turn by the ''Little Belt'' affair, in which a large American ship clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. Both sides claimed that the other fired first, but the British public in particular blamed the US for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge,{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} while the US was encouraged by the fact that they had won a victory over the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Hooks|2009|p=ii}} The US Navy also forcibly recruited British sailors, but the British government saw impressment as commonly accepted practice and preferred to rescue British sailors from American impressment on a case-by-case basis.{{sfn| Deeben|2012}}\n\n===British support of Indian raids===\n{{Warof1812-Origins}}\nThe [[Northwest Territory]] consisted of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and was the battleground for conflict between the United States and various Indian tribes.{{sfn|White|2010|p=416}} The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, both sides ignoring the fact that the land was partly inhabited by various tribes, including the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Winnebago people|Winnebago]], [[Shawnee]], [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Some warriors had left their tribes to follow [[Tenskwatawa]], the Shawnee prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\", by which he meant the American settlers.{{sfn|Willig|2008|p=207}} The Indians wanted to create their own state in the Northwest to end the American threat forever, as it became clear that the Americans wanted all of the land in the Old Northwest for national growth.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Indian tribes as valuable allies and a buffer to their Canadian colonies, so they began to provide arms and ammunition to the Indians; the subsequent Indian attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hitsman|1965|p=27}} Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=1997|1pp=253, 504|2a1=Zuehlke|2y=2007|2p=62}} British policy was divided towards the Indians. On the one hand, the British wanted to encourage Indian raids in order to keep the Americans fighting in the Northwest; they also wanted to preserve a region which provided rich profits for Canadian fur traders. On the other hand, they feared that too much support for the Indians would cause a war with the United States.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tecumseh's plans for an Indian state in the Northwest would benefit British North America by making it more defensible, but the defeats suffered by Tecumseh's confederation made the British leery of going too far to support what was probably a losing cause. British diplomats attempted to defuse tensions on the frontier in the months preceding the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}}\n[[File:\"A Scene on the Frontiers as Practiced by the Humane British and Their Worthy Allies!\".jpg|thumb|Americans believed that British officers paid their Indian allies to scalp American soldiers, c. 1812]]\nThe confederation's raids hindered American expansion into rich farmlands in the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=253, 392}} Pratt writes:\n\n{{quote|There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p=126}}}}\n\nHowever, the frontiersmen, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, had no doubt that their troubles with the Indians \"were the result of British intrigue\", and many settlers began circulating stories of British Army muskets and equipment being found on the field after Indian raids. Thus, \"the westerners were convinced that their problems could best be solved by forcing the British out of Canada\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-06.htm|title=American Military History, Army Historical Series, Chapter 6 |publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe British had the longstanding goal of creating a large Indian state to cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but they lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie. These battles destroyed the [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Indian confederacy]] which had been the main ally of the British in that region, weakening its negotiating position. Much of the area remained under British or British-allied Indian control until the end of the war, but the British dropped the demands.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1989|1pp=46\u201363, esp. |pp= 61\u201363|2a1=Carroll|2y=2001|2p=23}}\n\n===American expansionism===\n[[File:KENSETT MAP CANADA 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of the Canadas from 1812.

Loyalists settlers to the Canadas were Revolution-era exiles, hostile to union with the U.S., whereas newer immigrants to the Canadas were neutral or supportive of the British.]]\nMadison believed that British economic policies were harming the American economy because they were designed to bolster British trade; he also believed that Canada was a conduit for American smugglers who were undercutting his own trade policies, which could require the United States to annex British North America.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} Furthermore, Madison believed that the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence trade route might become the main trade route for the export of American goods to Europe; if the United States controlled the resources of British North America such as timber, which the British needed for their navy, then Britain would be forced to change its maritime policies which had so offended American public opinion.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} Congressman John Harper said in a speech that \"the Author of Nature Himself had marked our limits in the south, by the Gulf of Mexico and on the north, by the regions of eternal frost\".{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}}\n\n[[Upper Canada]] (southern Ontario) had been settled mostly by Revolution-era exiles from the United States ([[United Empire Loyalist]]s) or postwar American immigrants. The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States, while the immigrant settlers were generally uninterested in politics and remained neutral or supported the British during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans believed that many men in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American army as liberators. One reason that American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=206}} But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest, as [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed: \"The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2012|p=68}}\n[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States (1801\u20131809), believed that the acquisition of the Canadas was a \"mere matter of marching\".]]\n\nSome American border businessmen supported annexation because they wanted to gain control of Great Lakes trade.{{sfn|Nugent|2008|p=75}} Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of [[Spanish Florida]] by inhabitants of the American South; both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile Indian tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the [[Creek people|Creek]] in the South).{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006}} Tennessee Congressman [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn| Heller|2010|page=98}}\n\nHowever, historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth which goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He argues that consensus among scholars is that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\" of Canada. But Maass notes that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause.{{sfn|Maass|2014|pp=70\u201397}}\n\nHorsman argues that expansionism played a role as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory, and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as John A.

Johnson]], [[John A. Harper]], and [[Peter B. Porter]]. A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". Even major figures such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]] expected to keep at least Upper Canada in the event of an easy conquest. As a result, notable American generals such as [[William Hull]] issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General [[Alexander Smyth]] similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\" A lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals, however.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\nDavid and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy.

They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights.\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=4}}\n\n===U.S. political conflict===\n{{main|Federalist Party|Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Madison]], the fourth President of the United States (1809\u20131817).

The Federalist Party favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain, while the Democratic-Republican Party favoured a smaller central government, preservation of states' rights (including slavery), westward expansion, and a stronger break with Britain. By 1812, the Federalist Party had weakened considerably, and the Republicans were in a strong position, with James Madison completing his first term of office and control of Congress.{{sfn|Taylor|2010}} Support for the American cause was weak in Federalist areas of the Northeast throughout the war; fewer men volunteered to serve and the banks avoided financing the war. The negativism of the Federalists ruined the party's reputation, exemplified by the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814\u201315, and it survived only in scattered areas. By 1815, there was broad support for the war from all parts of the country. This allowed the triumphant Democratic-Republicans to adopt some Federalist policies, such as the national bank which Madison re-established in 1816.{{sfn|Hickey|1978|pp=23\u201339}}{{sfn|Banner|1970}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{Insufficient inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n===American===\nThe United States Navy had 7,250 sailors and Marines in 1812. It was a well-trained and professional force which fought well against the Barbary pirates and France in the [[Quasi War]]. The Navy had 13 ocean-going warships, three of them \"super-frigates\". Its principal problem was a lack of funding, as many in Congress did not see the need for a strong navy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=20}} The American warships were well-built ships that were at least equal to British ships of a similar class, as British shipbuilding emphasized quantity over quality.

Indian chiefs sought to fight only under favorable conditions; they would avoid any battle that promised heavy losses. The main Indian weapons were a mixture of muskets, rifles, bows, tomahawks, knives, swords, and clubs. Indian warriors were brave, but their tactics favored defense rather than offense.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn the words of Benn, the Indians fighting with the Americans provided the U.S. with their \"most effective light troops\", while the British desperately needed the Indian tribes as allies to compensate for their numerical inferiority. Regardless of which side they fought for, the highly decentralized bands and tribes considered themselves to be allies and not subordinates.

She arrived in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] eight days later. The news of the declaration took even longer to reach London.\n\nHowever, British commander [[Isaac Brock]] in Upper Canada received the news much faster, and he issued a proclamation alerting the citizenry of the state of war and urging all military personnel \"to be vigilant in the discharge of their duty\" to prevent communication with the enemy and to arrest anyone suspected of helping the Americans.{{sfn|Proclamation: Province of|2008}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=311}} He also issued orders to the commander of the British post at [[Fort St. Joseph (Ontario)|Fort St. Joseph]] to initiate offensive operations against American forces in northern Michigan, who were not yet aware of their own government's declaration of war.

The naturally cautious Pr\u00e9vost followed these instructions, concentrating on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada (which was more vulnerable to American attacks) and allowing few offensive actions.\n\nThe United States was not prepared to prosecute a war, for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men. Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men, but the service was voluntary and unpopular; it offered poor pay, and there were initially few trained and experienced officers.{{sfn|Quimby|1997|pp=2\u201312}} The militia objected to serving outside their home states, they were undisciplined, and they performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=847}} \n\nAmerican prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity, especially in [[New England]] where anti-war speakers were vocal.

The British already had a small squadron of warships on [[Lake Ontario]] when the war began, and they had the initial advantage. The Americans established a Navy yard at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], a port on Lake Ontario. Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the thousands of sailors and shipwrights assigned there and recruited from New York, and they completed a warship in a mere 45 days. Ultimately, almost 3,000 men worked at the shipyard, building 11 warships and many smaller boats and transports. Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, on April 27, 1813, Chauncey and Dearborn attacked [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the capital of [[Upper Canada]]. In addition to the sailors, Army forces were stationed at Sackett's Harbor, where they camped out through the town, far surpassing the small population of 900. Officers were housed with families.

They set fire to the village of Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) on December 10, 1813, incensing the Canadians and politicians in control. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. The British retaliated following their [[Capture of Fort Niagara]] on December 18, 1813. The British and their Indian allies stormed the neighbouring town of [[Lewiston, New York]] on December 19, torching homes and killing about a dozen civilians.

When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]], and the Americans were forced to retire.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|In October 1813, a force of Canadian [[Fencibles]], militiamen, and [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] repelled an American attempt to take Montreal at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River.]]]]\n\nThe Americans made two more thrusts against Montreal in 1813.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General [[James Wilkinson]] that would embark in boats and sail from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson, which limited his desire to support his plan. [[Charles de Salaberry]] defeated Hampton's force of 4,000 at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River]] on October 25 with a smaller force of [[Canadian Voltigeurs]] and [[Mohawks]]. Salaberry's force of Lower Canada militia and Indians numbered only 339, but had a strong defensive position.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on October 17 but was also delayed by bad weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain [[William Mulcaster]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Joseph Wanton Morrison]], and he was forced to land near [[Morrisburg, Ontario]] by November 10, about 150 kilometres (90&nbsp;mi) from Montreal. On November 11, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison's force of 800 at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] and was repulsed with heavy losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the U.S., and settled into winter quarters.

They had occupied southwestern Upper Canada after their victory in Moraviantown, and they believed that taking the rest of the province would force the British to cede it to them. The end of the war in Europe in April 1814 meant that the British could deploy their Army to North America, so the Americans were anxious to secure Upper Canada to negotiate from a position of strength. They planned to invade via the Niagara frontier while sending another force to recapture Mackinac;{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=47}} the British were supplying the Indians in the Old Northwest from Montreal via Mackinac.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=48}} They renewed their attack on the Niagara peninsula and quickly captured [[Fort Erie]] on July 3, 1814, with the garrison quickly surrendering to the Americans.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=49}} General Phineas Riall rushed towards the frontier, unaware of Fort Erie's fall or the size of the American force, and engaged in battle.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=49\u201350}} Winfield Scott then gained a victory over a British force at the [[Battle of Chippawa]] on July 5. The Americans brought out overwhelming firepower against the attacking British, who lost about 600 dead to the 350 dead on the American side. An attempt to advance further ended with a hard-fought but inconclusive [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] on July 25. Both sides stood their ground; American General Jacob Brown pulled back to Fort George after the battle, and the British did not pursue them.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=51}}\n[[File:British taking of the Northeast Bastion during the night assault on Fort Erie, August 14, 1814.png|thumb|British forces attempted to [[Siege of Fort Erie|storm Fort Erie]] on August 14, 1814 but were repelled by its American defenders.]]\nThe outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged [[Siege of Fort Erie]]. The British tried to storm Fort Erie on August 14, 1814 but suffered heavy losses, losing 950 killed, wounded, and captured compared to only 84 dead and wounded on the American side. The British were further weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines. Eventually they raised the siege, but American Major General [[George Izard]] took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. An American raid along the Grand River destroyed many farms and weakened British logistics. In October 1814, the Americans advanced into Upper Canada and engaged in skirmishes at Cook's Mill, but they pulled back when they heard that the new British warship HMS ''St. Lawrence'' was on its way, armed with 104 guns and launched in Kingston that September. The Americans lacked provisions and eventually destroyed Fort Erie and retreated across the Niagara.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=52}}\n\nMeanwhile, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington's ablest brigade commanders after Napoleon abdicated. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Pr\u00e9vost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor to gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Upper Lakes, and to defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives,{{sfn|Grodzinski|2010|pp=560\u2013561}} so he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], but he was worried about his flanks, so he decided that he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. The British squadron on the lake under Captain [[George Downie]] was more evenly matched by the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough \n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|Pr\u00e9vost's defeat at Plattsburgh led him to call off the invasion of New York.]]\n[[File:Flag of The Veteran Exempts of Battle of Plattsburgh.svg|thumb|Flag Flown at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nUpon reaching Plattsburgh, Pr\u00e9vost delayed the assault until Downie arrived in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate {{HMS|Confiance|1814|6}}. Pr\u00e9vost forced Downie into a premature attack but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later termed it \"the greatest naval battle of the war\".{{sfn|Roosevelt|1902 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n120/mode/1up 108]}} General [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]] led the successful land defence. Pr\u00e9vost then turned back, to the astonishment of his senior officers, saying that it was too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. He was recalled to London where a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Pr\u00e9vost urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. He died suddenly, just before his court-martial was to convene. His reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job but Pr\u00e9vost failed. Recent historians have been more kindly, however. Burroughs argues that his preparations were energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive for defending the Canadas with limited means, and he achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.{{sfn|Burroughs|1983}}\n\n[[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Hardy]] invaded the northern part of [[Massachusetts]] (Maine) on July 11 and took Fort Sullivan at [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].

The territory acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 contained almost no American settlements west of the Mississippi except around [[St. Louis]] and a few forts and trading posts in the [[Boonslick]]. [[Fort Belle Fontaine]] was an old trading post converted to an Army post in 1804, and this served as regional headquarters. [[Fort Osage]], built in 1808 along the Missouri, was the western-most American outpost; it was abandoned at the start of the war.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2002|p=270}} [[Fort Madison]] was built along the Mississippi in Iowa in 1808 and had been repeatedly attacked by British-allied [[Sauk people|Sauk]] since its construction.

[[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] played a leadership role.{{sfn|Cole | 1921|pp= 69\u201374.}}\n\nLittle of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813, but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there. During the ensuing winter, a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McDouall]] established a new supply line from York to [[Nottawasaga Bay]] on [[Georgian Bay]]. He arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements, then sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the far west. The [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]] ended in a British victory on July 20, 1814.\n\nEarlier in July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and Indians ambushed them in the brief [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1814)|Battle of Mackinac Island]] and forced them to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay, and they destroyed its fortifications on August 13 along with the schooner [[Nancy (1789 ship)|''Nancy'']] that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On September 4, the gunboats were taken unawares and captured by British boarding parties from canoes and small boats. These [[Engagements on Lake Huron]] left Mackinac under British control.\n\nThe British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major [[Zachary Taylor]]. American troops retreating from the [[Battle of Credit Island]] on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at [[Fort Johnson]], but they soon abandoned the fort and most of the upper Mississippi valley.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=85\u201394}} In this distant theater, the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war through the allegiance of several Indian tribes that received British gifts and arms, enabling them to take control of parts of Michigan and Illinois and the whole of Wisconsin.{{sfn|Concise Historical Atlas|1998|p=85}}\n\nAmerican forces were driven from the Upper Mississippi region, but they held on to eastern Missouri and the St. Louis area. Two notable battles fought against the Sauk were the Battle of Cote Sans Dessein in April 1815 at the mouth of the [[Osage River]] in the [[Missouri Territory]], and the [[Battle of the Sink Hole]] in May 1815 near [[Fort Cap au Gris]].\n{{sfn|Stevens|1921|pp=480\u2013482}}{{Verify source|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe British returned Mackinac and other captured territory to the United States after the war.

Most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against French privateers, but the Royal Navy still had 85 vessels in American waters, counting all North American and Caribbean waters.{{efn|Admiralty reply to British press criticism{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=180}})}} However, the Royal Navy's American squadron based in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] numbered one small [[ship of the line]], seven [[frigate]]s, nine smaller [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[brig]]s, and five [[schooner]]s.{{sfn|Gwyn|2003|p=134}} By contrast, the United States Navy was composed of 8 frigates, 14 smaller sloops and brigs, and no ships of the line. The U.S. had embarked on a major shipbuilding program before the war at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and continued to produce new ships. Three of the existing American frigates were exceptionally large and powerful for their class, larger than any British frigate in America. The standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38 gun ship, usually carrying up to 50 guns, with its main battery consisting of 18-pounder. USS ''Constitution'', ''President'', and ''United States'', in comparison, were rated as 44-gun ships, carrying 56\u201360 guns with a main battery of 24-pounders.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=50}}\n\nThe British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping between Halifax and the West Indies, and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade. Because of their numerical inferiority, the American strategy was to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics, such as the capturing prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances. Days after the formal declaration of war, however, America put out two small squadrons, including the frigate ''President'' and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805|2}} under Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]], and the frigates ''United States'' and {{USS|Congress|1799|2}}, with the brig {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} under Captain [[Stephen Decatur]]. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, who intended to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force.\n\nLarge numbers of American merchant ships were returning to the United States with the outbreak of war, and the Royal Navy could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard if they were concentrated together. Rodgers' strategy worked, in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off [[New York Harbor]] under Captain [[Philip Broke]], allowing many American ships to reach home. But Rodgers' own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.{{sfn|Black|2008}}\n\n====Single-ship actions====\nBoth American and British naval honour had been challenged in the lead-up to the war. The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]] had left the United States insulted by the Royal Navy's impressment of sailors, and the appropriate method for the American Navy to redeem itself was by duelling. Similarly, British honour was challenged in the ''Little Belt'' affair where the United States frigate {{USS|President|1800|2}} fired on the British sloop {{HMS|Little Belt}} because ''President'' mistook ''Little Belt'' for the British frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}. Captain James Dacres of ''Guerriere'' began a cycle of frigate duels by challenging ''President'' to a single ship duel to avenge the losses aboard ''Little Belt''. Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]] of ''President'' declined the challenge because he feared that the rest of the British squadron under Commodore [[Philip Broke]] might intervene.{{sfn| Toll| 2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} {{sfn|James| 1817}}\n[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}} defeats {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} in a [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|single-ship engagement]].

On July 17, Commodore Broke's British squadron gave chase off New York, including ''Guerriere'', but ''Constitution'' evaded her pursuers after two days. Borke detached ''Guerriere'' from his squadron to seek out repairs, as she had weak scantlings (beams fastened with a thickened clamp rather than vertical and horizontal knees){{sfn|Gardiner|2000}} and had become leaky and rotten.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James|1817}} She had also been struck by lightning, severely damaging her masts.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Captain Dacres was eager to engage the American frigate and to redeem British honour, as ''Constitution'' was the sister ship of ''President'' and would serve equally well as an American ship to duel. ''Constitution'' had nearly 50 percent more men, more firepower, heavier tonnage, and heavier scantlings (which determine how much damage enemy shot does to a ship) than ''Guerriere''.\n\n''Constitution'' sighted ''Guerriere'' 400 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia on August 19, and the two ships engaged in [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|a 35-minute battle]]. ''Constitution'' dismasted ''Guerriere'' and captured the crew. ''Guerriere'' was beyond repair, and the Americans burned it before returning to Boston.

Ship rigged vessels are more maneuverable in battle because they have a wider variety of sails thus being more resistant to damage. Ship-rigged vessels can back sail, literally backing up or heave to (stop).{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James| 1817}}{{sfn|Gardiner| 2000}} More significantly, if some spars are shot away on a brig because it is more difficult to wear, the brig loses the ability to steer, while a ship could adjust its more diverse canvas as if to wear to compensate for the imbalance caused by damage in battle.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Furthermore, ship-rigged vessels which three masts simply have more masts to shoot away than brigs with two masts before the vessel is unmanageable.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} In addition While the American ships had experienced and well-drilled volunteer crews, the enormous size of the overstretched Royal Navy meant that many ships were shorthanded and the average quality of crews suffered and the constant sea duties of those serving in North America interfered with their training and exercises.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} The only engagement between two brig-sloops was between the British ''Cruizer''-class brig {{HMS|Pelican|1812|3}} and the United States' {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} where ''Pelican'' emerged the victor as she had greater firepower and tonnage, despite having fewer crew.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Although not a sloop, the [[HMS Boxer (1812)|gun-brig ''Boxer'']] was [[Capture of HMS Boxer|taken]] by the brig-sloop {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}} in a bloody battle where ''Enterprise'' emerged the victor again due to superior force.\n\nIt was clear that in single ship battles, superior force was the most significant factor.

Despite having fewer guns, ''Endymion'' was armed with 24-pounders just like ''President''. This meant that ''Endymion'' shot could pierce the hull of ''President'' unlike ''Guerriere''{{'}}s which bounced of ''Constitution''{{'}}s hull or ''Java''{{'}}s that failed to cut through ''Constitution''{{'}}s mast. Following Broke's philosophy of \"Kill the man and the ship is your's\", ''Endymion'' fired into ''President''{{'}}s hull severely damaging her (shot holes below the waterline, 10/15 starboard guns on the gundeck disabled, water in the hold, and shot from ''Endymion'' found inside ''President''{{'}}s [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]].{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}). Decatur knew his only hope was to dismantle ''Endymion'' and sail away from the rest of the squadron. When he failed, he surrendered his ship to \"the captain of the black frigate (''Endymion'')\". Decatur took advantage of the fact ''Endymion'' had no boats that were intact and attempted to sneak away under the cover of night, only to be caught up by HMS ''Pomone''. Decatur surrendered without a fight.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} Decatur had surrendered the United States finest frigate and flagship ''President'' to a smaller ship, but part of a squadron of greater force.\n\nDecatur gave unreliable accounts of the battle stating that ''President'' was already \"severely damaged\" by a grounding before the engagement, but undamaged after the engagement with ''Endymion''. He stated ''Pomone'' caused \"significant\" losses aboard ''President'', although ''President''{{'}}s crew claim they were below deck gathering their belongings as they had already surrendered. Despite saying \"I surrender my ship to the captain of the black frigate\", Decatur also writes that he said, \"I surrender to the squadron\". Nevertheless, many historians such as Ian Toll, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] quote Decatur's remarks to either enforce that ''Endymion'' alone took ''President'' or that ''President'' surrendered to the whole squadron, when actually it was something in-between.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\nSuccess in single ship battles raised American morale after the repeated failed invasion attempts in Upper and Lower Canada. However, these victories had no military effect on the war at sea as they did not alter the balance of naval power, impede British supplies and reinforcements, or even raise insurance rates for British trade.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=102}} During the war, the United States Navy captured 165 British merchantmen (although privateers captured many more), while the Royal Navy captured 1,400 American merchantmen.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} More significantly, the British blockade of the Atlantic coast caused the majority warships to be unable to put to sea and shut down American imports and exports..\n\n====Privateering====\n[[File:Clipper Built Privateer Schooner.gif|thumb|[[Baltimore Clipper]]s were a series of schooners used by American [[privateers]] during the war.]]\nThe operations of American privateers proved a more significant threat to British trade than the U.S. Navy. They operated throughout the Atlantic and continued until the close of the war, most notably from ports such as [[Baltimore]]. American privateers reported taking 1300 British merchant vessels, compared to 254 taken by the U.S. Navy,{{sfn|American Merchant Marine}}{{sfn|Franklin}}{{sfn|Brewer |2004}} although the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802.{{sfn|Latimer|2007 |p= 242}} The Canadian historian Carl Benn wrote that American privateers took 1,344 British ships, of which 750 were retaken by the British.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However the British were able to limit privateering losses by the strict enforcement of [[convoy]] by the Royal Navy and by capturing 278 American privateers. Due to the massive size of the British merchant fleet, American captures only affected 7.5% of the fleet, resulting in no supply shortages or lack of reinforcements for British forces in North America.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|pp=394\u2013395}} Of 526 American privateers, 148 were captured by the Royal Navy and only 207 ever took a prize.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}}\n\nDue to the large size of their navy, the British did not rely as much on privateering. The majority of the 1,407 captured American merchant ships were taken by the Royal Navy. The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. However privateering remained popular in British colonies. It was the last hurrah for privateers in [[Bermuda]] who vigorously returned to the practice after experience in previous wars.{{sfn|Strannack|1909|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}}}} The nimble [[Bermuda sloop]]s captured 298 American ships. Privateer schooners based in [[British North America]], especially from [[Nova Scotia]] took 250 American ships and proved especially effective in crippling American coastal trade and capturing American ships closer to shore than the Royal Navy cruisers.{{sfn|Faye|1997|p=171}}\n\n====Blockade====\n[[File:Principal Campaigns of the War of 1812.gif|left|thumb|A map of the American coastline. British naval strategy was to protect their shipping in North America, and enforce a naval blockade on the U.S.]]\nThe [[Blockade|naval blockade]] of the United States began informally in 1812 and expanded to cut off more ports as the war progressed.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah and New York City as well.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However, as additional ships were sent to North America in 1813, the Royal Navy was able to tighten the blockade and extend it, first to the coast south of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon, and the end of the supply problems with Wellington's army, New England was blockaded.{{sfn| Grodzinski}}\n\nThe British government, having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain, benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them, so no blockade of New England was at first attempted.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} The [[Delaware River]] and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on December 26, 1812. Illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the U.S. government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading; this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=849}}\n\nThe blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port. The American frigates {{USS|United States}} and {{USS|Macedonian}} ended the war blockaded and [[hulk (ship type)|hulked]] in [[New London, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=55\u201356}} USS ''United States'' and USS ''Macedonian'' attempted to set sail to raid British shipping in the Caribbean, but were forced to turn back when confronted with a British squadron, and by the end of the war, the United States had six frigates and four ships-of-the-line sitting in port.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=56}} Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations. Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|opposition to the war]]. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130&nbsp;million in 1807 to $7&nbsp;million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies.{{sfn|Leckie|1998|p=255}} The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=56\u201357}} The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}}<ref>\"War of 1812.\" in ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History,'' edited by Thomas Riggs, (2nd ed., vol. 3, Gale, 2015), pp. 1446-1449.

During the war, a number of African Americans slaves escaped aboard British ships, settling in Canada or Trinidad.]]\nThe British Royal Navy's blockades and raids allowed about 4,000 African Americans to escape [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] by fleeing American plantations to find freedom aboard British ships, migrants known, as regards those who settled in Canada, as the [[Black Refugee (War of 1812)|Black Refugees]]. The blockading British fleet in [[Chesapeake Bay]] received increasing numbers of enslaved black Americans during 1813. By British government order they were treated as free persons when reaching British hands.{{sfn|Weiss|2013}}{{sfn|Malcomson |2012|p= 366}} Alexander Cochrane's [[Black Refugee (War of 1812)|proclamation of April 2, 1814]], invited Americans who wished to emigrate to join the British, and though not explicitly mentioning slaves was taken by all as addressed to them. About 2,400 of the escaped slaves and their families who were carried on ships of the Royal Navy following their escape settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] during and after the war. From May 1814, younger men among the volunteers were recruited into a new [[Corps of Colonial Marines]]. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] and the attacks on Washington, D.C. and Battle of Baltimore, later settling in Trinidad after rejecting British government orders for transfer to the [[West India Regiments]], forming the community of the [[Merikins]]. The slaves who escaped to the British represented the largest emancipation of African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Black Sailors Soldiers|2012}}\n\n====Occupation of Maine====\nMaine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U.S. and the British. Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast. In September 1813, there was a notable naval action when the U.S. Navy's brig {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}} [[Capture of HMS Boxer|fought and captured]] the Royal Navy brig {{HMS|Boxer|1812|2}} off Pemaquid Point.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=75\u201391}} The first British assault came in July 1814, when Sir [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]] took Moose Island ([[Eastport, Maine]]) without a shot, with the entire American garrison of [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]]\u2014which became the British Fort Sherbrooke\u2014surrendering.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=81\u201394}} Next, from his base in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in September 1814, Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]] led 3,000 British troops in the \"Penobscot Expedition\". In 26 days, he raided and looted [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the [[Battle of Hampden]] (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed). Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|2}}. The British occupied the town of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war, re-establishing the colony of [[New Ireland (Maine)|New Ireland]]. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States, though [[Machias Seal Island]] has remained in dispute. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took \u00a310,750 obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the \"Castine Fund\", was used to establish [[Dalhousie University]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Harvey|1938|pp=207\u2013213}}\n\n===={{anchor|Chesapeake Campaign|Expedition to the Chesapeake}}Chesapeake campaign and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nThe strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America's new national capital, Washington, D.C. on the major tributary of the [[Potomac River]], made it a prime target for the British. Starting in March 1813, a squadron under Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] started a blockade of the mouth of the Bay at [[Hampton Roads]] harbour and raided towns along the Bay from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to [[Raid on Havre de Grace|Havre de Grace, Maryland]].\n[[File:British Burning Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Following their victory at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], the British entered Washington, D.C., [[Burning of Washington|burning down buildings]] including the [[White House]].]]\nOn July 4, 1813, Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], a Revolutionary War naval hero, convinced the Navy Department to build the [[Chesapeake Bay Flotilla]], a squadron of twenty barges powered by small sails or oars (sweeps) to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered in the [[Patuxent River]], and while successful in harassing the Royal Navy, they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the \"[[Burning of Washington]]\". This expedition, led by Cockburn and General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]], was carried out between August 19 and 29, 1814, as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814. As part of this, Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral Alexander Cochrane, with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace.\n\nA force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard {{HMS|Royal Oak|1809|6}}, three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the [[Peninsular War]] by victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Pr\u00e9vost's request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at the national capital.\n\nOn August 24, U.S. Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr]]. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even when British army and naval units were obviously on their way to Washington. The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg, opening the route to Washington. While First Lady [[Dolley Madison]] saved valuables from what is now the \"[[White House]]\", senior officials fled to Virginia. {{sfn|Defense Burning of}} Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]] ordered setting fire to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to prevent the capture of supplies.{{sfn|Herrick|2005|page=90}} The nation's public buildings were destroyed by the British (and by a furious thunderstorm that ruined a great deal of property, although it did quench the flames). American morale was challenged, and many Federalists swung around and rallied to a patriotic defense of their homeland.\n[[File:Ft. Henry bombardement 1814.jpg|thumb|An artist's rendering of the bombardment at [[Fort McHenry]] during the [[Battle of Baltimore]]. Watching the bombardment from a truce ship, [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write the four-stanza poem that later became, ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''.]]\nThe British moved on to their major target, the heavily fortified major city of Baltimore. They delayed their movement allowing Baltimore an opportunity to strengthen the fortifications and bring in new federal troops and state militia units. The \"[[Battle of Baltimore|Battle for Baltimore]]\" began with the British landing on September 12, 1814, at [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|North Point]], where they were met by American militia further up the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. The British Army commander Major Gen. [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] was killed by snipers. The British paused, then continued to march northwestward to face the stationed Maryland and Baltimore City militia units at \"Godly Wood.\" The [[Battle of North Point]] was fought for several afternoon hours in a musketry and artillery duel. The British also planned to simultaneously attack Baltimore by water on the following day, September 13, to support their military facing the massed, heavily dug-in and fortified American units of approximately 15,000 with about a hundred cannon gathered along the eastern heights of the city named \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later \"Hampstead Hill\" \u2013 now part of [[Patterson Park]]). The Baltimore defences had been planned in advance and overseen by the state militia commander, Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]]. The Royal Navy was unable to reduce [[Fort McHenry]] at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor in support of an attack from the northeast by the British Army.\n\nThe British naval guns, mortars and new \"[[Congreve rockets]]\" had a longer range than the American cannon onshore. The ships mostly stood out of range of the Americans, who returned very little fire. The fort was not heavily damaged except for a burst over a rear brick wall knocking out some field pieces but with few casualties. The British eventually realized that they could not force the passage to attack Baltimore in coordination with the land force. A last ditch night feint and barge attack during a heavy rain storm was led by Capt. [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] around the fort up the Middle Branch of the river to the west. Split and misdirected partly in the storm, it turned back after suffering heavy casualties from the alert gunners of [[Fort Covington]] and [[Battery Babcock]]. The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] to write \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", a poem that was later set to music as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|2015|pp=599\u2013629}}\n\n===Southern theater===\nBecause of the region's polyglot population, both the British and the Americans perceived the war in the Gulf South as a fundamentally different conflict from the one occurring in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and Chesapeake.{{sfn|Millett|2013}}{{rp|31}}\n\n====Creek War====\n{{Main|Creek War}}\nBefore 1813, the war between the Creeks (or [[Muscogee]]) had been largely an internal affair sparked by the ideas of Tecumseh farther north in the Mississippi Valley. A faction known as the [[Red Sticks]], so named for the colour of their war stics, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. The Red Sticks were allied with Tecumseh, who about a year before 1813 had visited the Creeks and encouraged greater resistance to the Americans.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=23\u201325}} The Creek Nation was a trading partner of the United States, actively involved with Spanish and British trade as well. The Red Sticks, as well as many southern Muscogeean people like the [[Seminole]], had a long history of alliance with the Spanish and British Empires.{{sfn|Braund | 1993}} This alliance helped the North American and European powers protect each other's claims to territory in the south.{{sfn|Hurt |2002}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Burnt Corn]], between [[Red Sticks]] and U.S. troops, occurred in the southern parts of Alabama on July 27, 1813. It prompted the state of Georgia as well as the Mississippi territory militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives. The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the [[Alabama River|Alabama]], [[Coosa River|Coosa]], and [[Tallapoosa River]]s \u2013 Upper Creek territory. The Lower Creek lived along the [[Chattahoochee River]]. Many Creeks tried to remain friendly to the United States, and some were organized by federal Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]] to aid the 6th Military District under [[Thomas Pinckney|General Thomas Pinckney]] and the state militias. The United States combined forces were large. At its peak the Red Stick faction had 4,000 warriors, only a quarter of whom had muskets.{{sfn|Adams|1918|p=785}}\n[[File:Fort Mims massacre 1813.jpg|thumb|left|In 1813, Creek warriors [[Fort Mims massacre|attacked Fort Mims]], and killed a total of 400 to 500 people.

The army, led by [[John Floyd (Georgia politician)|General John Floyd]], went to the heart of the \"Creek Holy Grounds\" and won a major offensive against one of the largest Creek towns at [[Battle of Autosee]], killing an estimated two hundred people.

The Creek promised to join any body of 'troops that should aid them in regaining their lands, and suggesting an attack on the tower off Mobile.' In April 1814 the British established an outpost on the [[Apalachicola River]] (see [[Prospect Bluff Historic Sites]]).

Britain demanded naval control of the Great Lakes and access to the Mississippi River. The Americans refused to consider a buffer state and the proposal was dropped.{{sfn|Remini|1991|p=117}} Although Article IX of the treaty included provisions to restore to Natives \"all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\", the provisions were unenforceable; the British did not try and the Americans simply broke the treaty.{{sfn|Mahan|1905|pp=73\u201378}} The Americans (at a later stage) demanded damages for the burning of Washington and for the seizure of ships before the war began.{{sfn|Ward|Gooch|1922|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kVwyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA540 540]}}\n[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1812).jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which formally ended the war between the British Empire, and the United States.]]\nAmerican public opinion was outraged when Madison published the demands; even the Federalists were now willing to fight on.

The main focus on British foreign policy was the Congress of Vienna, during which British diplomats had clashed with Russian and Prussian diplomats over the terms of the peace with France, and there were fears that Britain might have go to war with Russia and Prussia. Now each side was tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed and after Napoleon fell in 1814 France was no longer an enemy of Britain, so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France, and it no longer needed to impress more seamen. It had ended the practices that so angered the Americans in 1812. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon.{{sfn|Mahan|1905}}\n\nBritish negotiators were urged by Lord Liverpool to offer a ''status quo'' and dropped their demands for the creation of an Indian barrier state, which was in any case hopeless after the collapse of Tecumseh's alliance. This allowed negotiations to resume at the end of October. British diplomats soon offered the ''status quo'' to the U.S. negotiators, who accepted them. Prisoners were to be exchanged and captured slaves returned to the United States or paid for by Britain. At this point, the number of slaves was approximately 6,000. Britain eventually refused the demand, allowing many to either emigrate to Canada or Trinidad.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn December 24, 1814 the diplomats had finished and signed the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27{{sfnm|1a1=Hickey|1y=2006|1p=295|2a1=Updyke|2y=1915|2p=360|3a1=Perkins|3y=1964|3pp=129\u2013130}} and arrived in Washington on February 17, where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, thus finally ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent failed to secure official British acknowledgement of American maritime rights or ending impressment. However, in the century of peace until World War I these rights were not seriously violated. The defeat of Napoleon made irrelevant all of the naval issues over which the United States had fought. The Americans had achieved their goal of ending the Indian threat; furthermore the American armies had scored enough victories (especially at New Orleans) to satisfy honour and the sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=208\u20139}}\n\n==Losses and compensation==\n{|align=right class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''''Casualties in the War of 1812'''''\n|-\n!

The Treaty of Ghent established the ''status quo ante bellum''; that is, there were no territorial losses by either side. The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy, no longer needing sailors, stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon in spring 1814 ended the war. (Napoleon unexpectedly returned in 1815, after the final end of the war of 1812.)\n\nThe long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory to both sides. Except for occasional border disputes and some tensions during the [[American Civil War]], relations between the U.S. and Britain remained peaceful for the rest of the 19th century, and the two countries became [[Special Relationship|close allies]] in the 20th century. Historian Troy Bickham argues that each participant defined success in a different way. The new American Republic could claim victory in the sense that its independence from London was assured, and the Indian barrier to Westward expansion was removed. The memory of the conflict played a major role in helping to consolidate a Canadian national identity after 1867. The British retained Canada, but their attention was overwhelmingly devoted to celebrating the defeat of Napoleon. The general consensus is that the Native Americans were the big losers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy Bickham|title=The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM755oY5k98C&pg=PT262|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=262\u201380|isbn=9780199942626}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] between the United States and Britain was enacted in 1817. It demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary. It remains in effect to this day.\n\nAlthough Britain had defeated the American invasions of Canada, its own invasions were defeated in Maryland, New York and Louisiana. After two decades of intense warfare against France, Britain was in no mood to have more conflicts with the United States. Instead it focused on expanding the British Empire into India. Britain never seriously challenged the US over land claims after 1846: it had hoped to keep Texas Independent from the United States and had some hopes of taking California from Mexico. From the 1890s, as the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial power, Britain wanted American friendship in a hypothetical European war. Border adjustments between the U.S. and British North America were made in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]], Massachusetts, was returned to the U.S. in 1818; [[Missouri Compromise|it became part]] of the new State of [[Maine]] in 1820. A border dispute along the Maine\u2013New Brunswick border was settled by the 1842 [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] after the bloodless [[Aroostook War]], and the border in the [[Oregon Country]] was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]]. A further dispute about the line of the border through the island in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] resulted in another almost bloodless standoff in the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] of 1859. The line of the border was finally settled by an international arbitration commission in 1872.\n\n===Bermuda===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nBermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before U.S. independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795, as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports. It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron, but the war saw it rise to a new prominence. As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters, housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard. The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment, heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the \"Gibraltar of the West\". Defence infrastructure remained the central leg of Bermuda's economy until after World War II.\n\n===The Canadas===\n[[File:Fort Henry, Kingston.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston in 1836.

In the decades following the war, several projects were undertaken to improve the defence of the colonies against the United States. They include work on [[La Citadelle]] at [[Quebec City]], [[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston, and rebuilding [[Fort York]] at York. Additionally, work began on the [[Halifax Citadel]] to defend the port against foreign navies. From 1826 to 1832, the Rideau Canal was built to provide a secure waterway not at risk from American cannon fire. To defend the western end of the canal, the British Army also built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] at Kingston.{{sfn|Hayes|2008|p=117}}\n\n===Indigenous nations===\nThe Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause. The British proposal to create a \"neutral\" Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced. After 1814 the natives, who lost most of their fur-gathering territory, became an undesirable burden to British policymakers. The latter now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}} The United States further disrupted trade along the northern border by prohibiting British fur traders from operating in the US, whereas before the war, both populations had freely moved back and forth across the border.\n\nBritish agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former American Indian partners, but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no American Indian campaigns to stop U.S. expansionism in the Midwest. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, American Great Lakes\u2013area Indians ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}}\n\n===Great Britain===\nThe war is seldom remembered in Great Britain. The massive ongoing conflict in Europe against the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] ensured that the British did not consider the War of 1812 against America as more than a sideshow.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=304}} Britain's blockade of French trade had been entirely successful, and the Royal Navy was the world's dominant nautical power (and remained so for another century). While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the U.S. Navy in port, and widely suppressed privateering. British businesses, some affected by rising insurance costs, were demanding peace so that trade could resume with the U.S.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Latimer|2y=2009|2p=88}} The peace was generally welcomed by the British, though there was disquiet about the rapid growth of the U.S. However, the two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and, over time, a growing friendship.{{sfn|Stearns|2008|p=547}}\n\nHickey argues that for Britain:\n{{quote|the most important lesson of all [was] that the best way to defend Canada was to accommodate the United States.

Several war heroes used their fame to win election to national office. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both took advantage of their military successes to win the presidency, while Richard Mentor Johnson used his wartime exploits to help attain the vice presidency.\n\nDuring the war, New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them. They complained that the U.S. government was not investing enough in the states' defences militarily and financially, and that the states should have more control over their militias. The increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=255ff}} As a result, at the [[Hartford Convention]] (December 1814{{snd}}January 1815) Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared at the same time that peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known. The upshot was that the Federalists were permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.{{sfn|Cogliano|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnJJ-GDktHgC&pg=PA234 234]}}\n\nThis war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked at the sight of their slaves fleeing, risking so much to be free.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The British aided numerous Black Refugees in resettling in New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, where [[Black Loyalists]] had also been granted land after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat of the Creek Indians at the battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, some Creek warriors escaped to join the [[Seminole]] in Florida, who had been forming as an ethnic group since the late 18th century. The remaining Creek chiefs signed away about half their lands, comprising 23,000,000 acres, covering much of southern Georgia and two thirds of modern Alabama. The Creek were separated from any future help from the Spanish in Florida, and from the Choctaw and Chickasaw to the west. During the war the United States seized [[Mobile, Alabama]], which was a strategic location as it provided an oceanic outlet for export from the cotton lands to the north.  Most were yet to be developed, but US control of this territory increased pressure on remaining Creek, as European Americans began to migrate in number into the area.\n\nJackson invaded Florida in 1818, demonstrating to Spain that it could no longer control that territory with a small force. Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] following the [[First Seminole War]]. Pratt concludes:\n\n{{quote|Thus indirectly the War of 1812 brought about the acquisition of Florida.... To both the Northwest and the South, therefore, the War of 1812 brought substantial benefits.

Each young country saw its self-perceived victory, and settling of the border between them, as an important foundation of its growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute, a distraction from the principal task at hand.\n\n===American===\nWhile American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814,{{sfn|Defense Burning of}} which necessitated its extensive renovation, it focused on the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburg, and New Orleans to present the war as a successful effort to assert American national honour, the \"second war of independence\" in which the mighty British empire was humbled and humiliated.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=82\u201383}} In a speech before Congress on February 18, 1815, President [[James Madison]] proclaimed the war a complete American victory.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nThis interpretation of the war was and remains the dominant American view of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} The American newspaper the ''Niles Register'', in an editorial on September 14, 1816, announced that the Americans had crushed the British, declaring \"...we did virtually dictate the treaty of Ghent to the British\".{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} A minority of Americans, mostly associated with the Federalists, considered the war a defeat and an act of folly on Madison's part, caustically asking if the Americans were \"dictating\" the terms of the treaty of Ghent, why the British Crown did not cede British North America to the United States?{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} However, the Federalist view of the war is not the mainstream American memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} Congressman [[George Troup]], who said in a speech in 1815 that the Treaty of Ghent was \"the glorious termination of the most glorious war ever waged by any people\", expressed American popular opinion and memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nAmericans also celebrated the successful American defence of [[Fort McHenry]] in September 1814, which inspired the lyrics of what was adopted as the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".{{sfn|Star-Spangled Banner War}} The successful captains of the U.S. Navy became popular heroes, and commemorative plates were produced with the likenesses of Decatur, Issac Hull, and [[Charles Stewart (1778\u20131869)|Charles Stewart]] on them, becoming popular items. Many of these plates were manufactured in England. The navy became a cherished institution, lauded for the victories that it won against all odds.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=456}} After engagements during the final actions of the war, U.S. Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as excellent marksmen, especially in ship-to-ship actions. {{sfn|Simmons|2003}}\n\n===Canadian===\n[[File:Couplandart.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Douglas Coupland]]'s '[[Monument to the War of 1812]]' (2008) in Toronto; depicts a larger-than-life Canadian soldier triumphing over an American; both are depicted as metallic toy soldiers of the sort small children play with.]]\n\nIn British North America, the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory, as they had claimed they had successfully defended their country from an American takeover.{{sfn|Kaufman|1997|pp=110\u2013135}} A long-term consequence of the Canadian militia's success was the view, widely held in Canada at least until the First World War, that Canada did not need a regular professional army.{{sfn|Cmh: Origins of|2007}} While Canadian militia units had played instrumental roles in several engagements, such as at the Battle of the Chateauguay, it was the regular units of the British Army, including its \"Fencible\" regiments which were recruited within North America, which ensured that Canada was successfully defended.\n\nThe U.S. Army had done poorly, on the whole, in several attempts to invade Canada, and the Canadians had fought bravely to defend their territory. But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would remain vulnerable in a third war. \"We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again\", Admiral Sir [[David Milne (Royal Navy officer)|David Milne]] wrote to a correspondent in 1817,{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=458\u2013459}} although the [[Rideau Canal]] was built for just such a scenario.\n\nBy the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain,{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=1}} although still remembered in Canada, especially Ontario. In a 2009 poll, 37% of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory, 9% said the U.S. won, 15% called it a draw, and 39% said they knew too little to comment.{{sfn|Boswell|2009}} A 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians' identity, the belief that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second (25%).{{sfn|Ipsos Reid}}\n\n===Historians' views===\nHistorians have differing and complex interpretations of the war.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the \"real winners\" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascos and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failures to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British attack on New Orleans and upstate New York.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=74}}\n\nHowever, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and retaining their Canadian colonies. In contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the U.S. lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, arguing that the U.S. actions had no effect on the Orders in Council, which were rescinded before the war started.{{sfnm|1a1=Benn|1y=2002|p=83|2a1=Latimer|2y=2007|2p=3}}\n\nHistorian Troy Bickham, author of ''The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812'', sees the British as having fought to a much stronger position than the United States.\n\n<blockquote>Even tied down by ongoing wars with Napoleonic France, the British had enough capable officers, well-trained men, and equipment to easily defeat a series of American invasions of Canada. In fact, in the opening salvos of the war, the American forces invading Upper Canada were pushed so far back that they ended up surrendering Michigan Territory. The difference between the two navies was even greater. While the Americans famously (shockingly for contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic) bested British ships in some one-on-one actions at the war's start, the Royal Navy held supremacy throughout the war, blockading the U.S. coastline and ravaging coastal towns, including Washington, D.C. Yet in late 1814, the British offered surprisingly generous peace terms despite having amassed a large invasion force of veteran troops in Canada, naval supremacy in the Atlantic, an opponent that was effectively bankrupt, and an open secessionist movement in New England.</blockquote>\n\nHe considers that the British offered the United States generous terms, in place of their initially harsh terms (which included massive forfeiture of land to Canada and the American Indians), because the \"reigning Liverpool ministry in Britain held a loose grip on power and feared the war-weary, tax-exhausted public\". The war was also technically a British victory \"because the United States failed to achieve the aims listed in its declaration of war\".{{sfn|Bickham|2017}}\n\nA second minority view is that both the U.S. and Britain won the war\u2014that is, both achieved their main objectives, as the U.S. restored its independence and honour, and opened the way to westward expansion, while Britain defeated Napoleon and ruled the seas.{{sfn|Turner |2000}} American historian Norman K. Risjord argues that the main motivation was restoring the nation's honour in the face of relentless British aggression toward American neutral rights on the high seas, and in the Western lands. The results in terms of honour satisfied the War Hawks.{{sfn|Risjord|1961| pp=196\u2013210}} American historian Donald Hickey asks, \"Did the cost in blood and treasure justify the U.S. decision to go to war? Most Republicans thought it did. In the beginning they called the contest a 'second war of independence', and while Britain's maritime practices never truly threatened the Republic's independence, the war did in a broad sense vindicate U.S. sovereignty. But it ended in a draw on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction}} Historians argue that it was an American success to end the threat of Indian raids, kill the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary, and hereby to open an unimpeded path for westward expansion.{{efn|''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' concludes, \"British plans for an American Indian buffer state were dropped, and American Indian nations within U.S. borders lost their last major remaining European diplomatic partner, clearing a path for American westward expansion.\"{{sfn|Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|page=343}}&nbsp;}} [[Winston Churchill]] concluded:\n<blockquote>The lessons of the war were taken to heart. Anti-American feeling in Great Britain ran high for several years, but the United States were never again refused proper treatment as an independent power.{{sfn|Churchill|1958|page=366}}</blockquote>\n\nAmerican naval historian George C. Daughan argues that the US achieved enough of its war goals to claim a victorious result of the conflict, and subsequent impact it had on the negotiations in Ghent. Daughan uses official correspondences from President Madison to the delegates at Ghent strictly prohibiting negotiations with regards to maritime law, stating:{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=328}}\n\n<blockquote>Madison's latest dispatches [arrived July 25\u201327, 1814] permitted them [the delegates] to simply ignore the entire question of maritime rights. Free trade with liberated Europe had already been restored, and the Admiralty no longer needed impressment to man its warships. The president felt that with Europe at peace the issues of neutral trading rights and impressment could safely be set aside in the interests of obtaining peace... Thus, from the start of the negotiations, the disagreements that started the war and sustained it were acknowledged by both parties to be no longer important.</blockquote>\n\nThe British permanently stopped impressing Americans, although they never publicly rescinding the possibility of resuming that practice. The US delegates at the meeting understood it to be a dead issue after the 1814 surrender of Napoleon.{{sfn|Rutland | 1994 | p=200}} In addition, the successful defence of Baltimore, Plattsburgh, and Fort Erie (a strategic fortress located in Upper Canada on the Niagara River, and occupied during the third and most successful offensive into Canada) had very favorable influence on the negotiations for the Americans and prompted several famous responses from both sides. Henry Clay wrote to the delegates in October 1814, \"for in our own country, my dear sir, at last must we conquer the peace.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=353}} With growing pressure in Britain, the Duke of Wellington, when asked to command the forces in America, wrote to Liverpool on November 9, 1814, \"I confess that I think you have no right, from the state of the war, to demand any concession of territory from America&nbsp;... You have not been able to carry&nbsp;... [the war] into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack [Fort Erie]&nbsp;... Why Stipulate for ''uti possidetis''?\"{{sfn|Mills|1921|pp=19\u201332}} The argument that the US failed to capture any Canadian territory that influenced the negotiations is an outdated and highly criticized position, argues Daughan. He cites the ''Edinburgh Review'', a British newspaper, who had remained silent about the war with America for two years, wrote \"the British government had embarked on a war of conquest, after the American government had dropped its maritime demands, and the British had lost. It was folly to attempt to invade and conquer the United States. To do so would result in the same tragedy as the first war against them, and with the same result.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=359}}\n\n====National bias of historians====\nHistorians have different views on who won the War of 1812, and there is an element of national bias to this.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} British and Canadian historians follow the view that the war was a British victory, and some US historians also support this view. {{sfn|Boswell|2011}} The opposing position, held by most US historians along with some Canadians and British, is that the result was a stalemate. Only US historians follow the minority view that the US was the victorious party in the war.{{sfn|Hattendorf|2012}}{{sfn|Simon|2012}}{{sfn|Boswell|2011}}{{sfn|Foreman|2014}} Similarly, a survey of school textbooks found that historians from Canada, Britain, and the United States emphasize different aspects of the war according to their national narratives; some British texts will scarcely mention the war.''{{sfn|Mowat|1965|p=35}}''\n\n====Indians as losers====\nHistorians generally agree that the real losers of the War of 1812 were the Indians (called First Nations in Canada). Hickey says:\n\n{{quote|The big losers in the war were the Indians. As a proportion of their population, they had suffered the heaviest casualties. Worse, they were left without any reliable European allies in North America&nbsp;... The crushing defeats at the Thames and Horseshoe Bend left them at the mercy of the Americans, hastening their confinement to reservations and the decline of their traditional way of life.{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction. |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2bBHL2ePWcC&pg=PT22 22]}}{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|page=23}}{{sfn|Bowman|Greenblatt|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Kessel|Wooster|2005|page=145}}}}\n[[File:Jackson and Weatherford.jpg|thumb|[[William Weatherford]] surrendering to Andrew Jackson at the end of the Creek War. The peace imposed on the Creek saw them cede half of their territory to the United States.]]\nThe Indians of the Old Northwest (the modern Midwest) had hoped to create an Indian state to be a British protectorate.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}} American settlers into the Middle West had been repeatedly blocked and threatened by Indian raids before 1812, and that now came to an end. Throughout the war the British had played on terror of the tomahawks and scalping knives of their Indian allies; it worked especially at Hull's surrender at Detroit. By 1813 Americans had killed Tecumseh and broken his coalition of tribes. Jackson then defeated the Creek in the Southwest. Historian John Sugden notes that in both theaters, the Indians' strength had been broken prior to the arrival of the major British forces in 1814.{{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=311}} The one campaign that the Americans had decisively won was the campaign in the Old Northwest, which put the British in a weak hand to insist upon an Indian state in the Old Northwest.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}}\n\nNotwithstanding the sympathy and support from commanders (such as Brock,{{efn|{{harvtxt|Sugden|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} mentions that 'Brock had urged the British government to protect his Indian allies in peace negotiations, and by the end of 1812 he had obtained from Earl Bathurst, colonial secretary, a promise to that effect.'}} Cochrane and Nicolls), the policymakers in London reneged in assisting the Indians, as making peace was a higher priority for the politicians. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but, although the British and their Indian allies maintained control over the territories in question (i.e. most of the [[Upper Midwest]]), British diplomats did not press the demand after an American refusal, effectively abandoning their Indian allies. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]).{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=435\u2013439}} In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had \"enduring and massive consequences\".{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=421}} It gave the Americans \"continental predominance\" while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=437}}\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent technically required the United States to cease hostilities and \"forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\"; the United States ignored this article of the treaty and proceeded to expand into this territory regardless; Britain was unwilling to provoke further war to enforce it. A shocked [[Henry Goulburn]], one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked:\n\n{{quote|Till I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.{{sfn|Treaty of Ghent}}}}\n\nThe Creek War came to an end, with the Treaty of Fort Jackson being imposed upon the Indians. About half of the Creek territory was ceded to the United States, with no payment made to the Creeks. This was, in theory, invalidated by Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent. {{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=304}} The British failed to press the issue, and did not take up the Indian cause as an infringement of an international treaty. Without this support, the Indians' lack of power was apparent and the stage was set for further incursions of territory by the United States in subsequent decades.

Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|Napoleonic Wars]], while historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nFrom the outbreak of war with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain [[impressment|pressed]] American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake\u2013Leopard'' affair]], which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the [[Little Belt affair|''Little Belt'' affair]] in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.{{sfn|Stagg|1983|p=4}} Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of [[British North America]] (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President [[James Madison]] signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.{{sfn|Woodworth|1812}}\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting [[Napoleon]], Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier along with help from Native American allies. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|its unpopularity]], especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the [[Siege of Detroit]] and the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] thwarted attempts to seize [[Upper Canada]], improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade [[Lower Canada]] and capture [[Montreal]]. In 1813, the Americans won the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], gaining control of the lake, and they defeated [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of the Thames]], defeating the largest Native ally of Britain and securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids [[Burning of Washington|burned the capital]], but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invade New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Maryland]], ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans [[Battle of New Orleans|decisively defeated]] the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in [[Spanish Florida]]; a [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|two-day battle]] for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.{{sfn|Heidler|p=45}}\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|abdication of Napoleon]], Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment generally. This made moot the issue of American sailor impressment, and removed one of the original causes of the war. The British were then able to increase the strength of their blockade of the United States coast. Attempts to smother American maritime trade failed, however, at which point both sides began to desire peace.{{sfn|Fowler|2017|pages=23\u201324}}\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.{{sfn|order of the Senate of the United States|1828|pages=619\u2013620}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origins of the War of 1812}}\nHistorians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying the origin of the War of 1812. This section summarizes several contributing factors which resulted in the declaration of war by the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Trautsch|1y=2013|1pp=273\u2013293|2a1=Egan|2y=1974|3a1=Goodman|3y=1941|3pp=171\u2013186}}{{sfn| Silverstone |2004|page=95}}\n\n===Honour and the second war of independence===\nAs Risjord (1961) notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults, such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]].{{sfn|Risjord|1961|pp=196\u2013210}} [[H. W. Brands]] writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=163}} Americans at the time and historians since{{sfn|Swanson |1945}} have often called it the United States' \"Second War of Independence\".{{sfn|Hickey|2013}}\n\nThe British, at the same time, were offended by what they considered insults, such as the [[Little Belt affair|\"Little Belt\" affair]]. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the United States flagship ''President'', which they succeeded in doing in 1815.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\n===Impressment and naval actions===\nIn 1807, Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]] to impede neutral trade with France, whom Britain was fighting in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.{{sfn|Fanis|2011|p=94}} Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\"{{sfn|Horsman|1962|p=264}} The American merchant marine had nearly doubled between 1802 and 1810, making it by far the largest neutral fleet. Britain was the largest trading partner, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of other American exports, and the British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=281}} The United States' view was that Britain's restrictions violated its right to trade with others.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy expanded to 176 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and 600 ships overall, requiring 140,000 sailors to man them.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=382}} The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but it competed in wartime with merchant shipping and privateers for a small pool of experienced sailors, so it  turned to [[impressment]] from ashore and from foreign and domestic shipping when it could not operate its ships with volunteers alone.\n\nThe United States believed that British deserters had a right to become American citizens, but Britain did not recognize a right whereby a British subject could relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The British Navy, therefore, considered any American citizen liable for impressment if he was born British. Aggravating the situation was the United States' reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers, and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or [[protection papers]] among sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|pages=565\u2013566}} This made it difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non-Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British. Some gained freedom on appeal.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=17}} The Admiralty estimated that there were 11,000 naturalized sailors on United States ships in 1805, and US Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] stated that 9,000 US sailors had been born in Great Britain or Ireland.{{sfn|Caffrey|1977|p=60}} Captain [[Isaac Chauncey]] found in 1808 that 58-percent of sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants. Of these 150 naturalized sailors, 80 were from Ireland and 54 from other parts of the United Kingdom.\n[[File:Story of one hundred years - A comprehensive review of the political and military events, the social, intellectual and material progress, and the general state of mankind in all lands.

The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]] and other acts of impressment angered the American public.]]\nAmerican anger grew when British frigates were stationed just outside US harbours and in view of US shores to search ships and impress men while within US territorial waters.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=278\u2013279}} Well-publicized impressment actions outraged the American public, such as the [[Leander affair|''Leander'' affair]] and the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]].{{sfn|Black|2002|p=44}}{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe British public were outraged in their turn by the ''Little Belt'' affair, in which a large American ship clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. Both sides claimed that the other fired first, but the British public in particular blamed the US for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge,{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} while the US was encouraged by the fact that they had won a victory over the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Hooks|2009|p=ii}} The US Navy also forcibly recruited British sailors, but the British government saw impressment as commonly accepted practice and preferred to rescue British sailors from American impressment on a case-by-case basis.{{sfn| Deeben|2012}}\n\n===British support of Indian raids===\n{{Warof1812-Origins}}\nThe [[Northwest Territory]] consisted of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and was the battleground for conflict between the United States and various Indian tribes.{{sfn|White|2010|p=416}} The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, both sides ignoring the fact that the land was partly inhabited by various tribes, including the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Winnebago people|Winnebago]], [[Shawnee]], [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Some warriors had left their tribes to follow [[Tenskwatawa]], the Shawnee prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\", by which he meant the American settlers.{{sfn|Willig|2008|p=207}} The Indians wanted to create their own state in the Northwest to end the American threat forever, as it became clear that the Americans wanted all of the land in the Old Northwest for national growth.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Indian tribes as valuable allies and a buffer to their Canadian colonies, so they began to provide arms and ammunition to the Indians; the subsequent Indian attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hitsman|1965|p=27}} Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=1997|1pp=253, 504|2a1=Zuehlke|2y=2007|2p=62}} British policy was divided towards the Indians. On the one hand, the British wanted to encourage Indian raids in order to keep the Americans fighting in the Northwest; they also wanted to preserve a region which provided rich profits for Canadian fur traders. On the other hand, they feared that too much support for the Indians would cause a war with the United States.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tecumseh's plans for an Indian state in the Northwest would benefit British North America by making it more defensible, but the defeats suffered by Tecumseh's confederation made the British leery of going too far to support what was probably a losing cause. British diplomats attempted to defuse tensions on the frontier in the months preceding the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}}\n[[File:\"A Scene on the Frontiers as Practiced by the Humane British and Their Worthy Allies!\".jpg|thumb|Americans believed that British officers paid their Indian allies to scalp American soldiers, c. 1812]]\nThe confederation's raids hindered American expansion into rich farmlands in the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=253, 392}} Pratt writes:\n\n{{quote|There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p=126}}}}\n\nHowever, the frontiersmen, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, had no doubt that their troubles with the Indians \"were the result of British intrigue\", and many settlers began circulating stories of British Army muskets and equipment being found on the field after Indian raids. Thus, \"the westerners were convinced that their problems could best be solved by forcing the British out of Canada\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-06.htm|title=American Military History, Army Historical Series, Chapter 6 |publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe British had the longstanding goal of creating a large Indian state to cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but they lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie. These battles destroyed the [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Indian confederacy]] which had been the main ally of the British in that region, weakening its negotiating position. Much of the area remained under British or British-allied Indian control until the end of the war, but the British dropped the demands.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1989|1pp=46\u201363, esp. |pp= 61\u201363|2a1=Carroll|2y=2001|2p=23}}\n\n===American expansionism===\n[[File:KENSETT MAP CANADA 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of the Canadas from 1812.

The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States, while the immigrant settlers were generally uninterested in politics and remained neutral or supported the British during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans believed that many men in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American army as liberators. One reason that American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=206}} But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest, as [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed: \"The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2012|p=68}}\n[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States (1801\u20131809), believed that the acquisition of the Canadas was a \"mere matter of marching\".]]\n\nSome American border businessmen supported annexation because they wanted to gain control of Great Lakes trade.{{sfn|Nugent|2008|p=75}} Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of [[Spanish Florida]] by inhabitants of the American South; both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile Indian tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the [[Creek people|Creek]] in the South).{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006}} Tennessee Congressman [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn| Heller|2010|page=98}}\n\nHowever, historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth which goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He argues that consensus among scholars is that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\" of Canada. But Maass notes that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause.{{sfn|Maass|2014|pp=70\u201397}}\n\nHorsman argues that expansionism played a role as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory, and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as John A. Harper, Felix Grundy, Henry Clay, and Richard M. Johnson, who voted for war with expansion as a key aim.\n\n{{quote|In disagreeing with those interpretations that have simply stressed expansionism and minimized maritime causation, historians have ignored deep-seated American fears for national security, dreams of a continent completely controlled by the republican United States, and the evidence that many Americans believed that the War of 1812 would be the occasion for the United States to achieve the long-desired annexation of Canada\u2026 Thomas Jefferson well-summarized American majority opinion about the war\u2026 to say \"that the cession of Canada\u2026 must be a [[sine qua non]] at a treaty of peace\".{{sfn| Horsman|1987}}}}\nHowever, Horsman states that in his view \"the desire for Canada did not cause the War of 1812\" and that \"The United States did not declare war because it wanted to obtain Canada, but the acquisition of Canada was viewed as a major collateral benefit of the conflict.\"{{sfn|Horsman |1987}}\n[[File:Peter Buell Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter B.

Johnson]], [[John A. Harper]], and [[Peter B. Porter]]. A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". Even major figures such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]] expected to keep at least Upper Canada in the event of an easy conquest. As a result, notable American generals such as [[William Hull]] issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General [[Alexander Smyth]] similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\" A lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals, however.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\nDavid and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy.

They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights.\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=4}}\n\n===U.S. political conflict===\n{{main|Federalist Party|Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Madison]], the fourth President of the United States (1809\u20131817).

The Federalist Party favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain, while the Democratic-Republican Party favoured a smaller central government, preservation of states' rights (including slavery), westward expansion, and a stronger break with Britain. By 1812, the Federalist Party had weakened considerably, and the Republicans were in a strong position, with James Madison completing his first term of office and control of Congress.{{sfn|Taylor|2010}} Support for the American cause was weak in Federalist areas of the Northeast throughout the war; fewer men volunteered to serve and the banks avoided financing the war. The negativism of the Federalists ruined the party's reputation, exemplified by the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814\u201315, and it survived only in scattered areas. By 1815, there was broad support for the war from all parts of the country. This allowed the triumphant Democratic-Republicans to adopt some Federalist policies, such as the national bank which Madison re-established in 1816.{{sfn|Hickey|1978|pp=23\u201339}}{{sfn|Banner|1970}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{Insufficient inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n===American===\nThe United States Navy had 7,250 sailors and Marines in 1812. It was a well-trained and professional force which fought well against the Barbary pirates and France in the [[Quasi War]]. The Navy had 13 ocean-going warships, three of them \"super-frigates\". Its principal problem was a lack of funding, as many in Congress did not see the need for a strong navy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=20}} The American warships were well-built ships that were at least equal to British ships of a similar class, as British shipbuilding emphasized quantity over quality.

Indian chiefs sought to fight only under favorable conditions; they would avoid any battle that promised heavy losses.

Indian warriors were brave, but their tactics favored defense rather than offense.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn the words of Benn, the Indians fighting with the Americans provided the U.S. with their \"most effective light troops\", while the British desperately needed the Indian tribes as allies to compensate for their numerical inferiority.

The naturally cautious Pr\u00e9vost followed these instructions, concentrating on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada (which was more vulnerable to American attacks) and allowing few offensive actions.\n\nThe United States was not prepared to prosecute a war, for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men. Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men, but the service was voluntary and unpopular; it offered poor pay, and there were initially few trained and experienced officers.{{sfn|Quimby|1997|pp=2\u201312}} The militia objected to serving outside their home states, they were undisciplined, and they performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=847}} \n\nAmerican prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity, especially in [[New England]] where anti-war speakers were vocal.

Along the way they attempted to [[Battle of Fort Stephenson|storm Fort Stephenson]], a small American post on the [[Sandusky River]] near [[Lake Erie]]. They were repulsed with serious losses, marking the end of their Ohio campaign.\n\nCaptain [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] fought the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on September 10, 1813. His decisive victory at \"[[Put-in-Bay]]\" ensured American military control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. This enabled General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada, which culminated in the American victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]] on October 5, 1813; [[Tecumseh]] was killed there.\n\n====Niagara frontier, 1813====\n[[File:Niagara River 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] during the War of 1812]]\nBritish and American leaders placed great importance on gaining control of the Great Lakes and the [[St. Lawrence River]] because of the difficulties of land-based communication. The British already had a small squadron of warships on [[Lake Ontario]] when the war began, and they had the initial advantage. The Americans established a Navy yard at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], a port on Lake Ontario. Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the thousands of sailors and shipwrights assigned there and recruited from New York, and they completed a warship in a mere 45 days. Ultimately, almost 3,000 men worked at the shipyard, building 11 warships and many smaller boats and transports. Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, on April 27, 1813, Chauncey and Dearborn attacked [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the capital of [[Upper Canada]]. In addition to the sailors, Army forces were stationed at Sackett's Harbor, where they camped out through the town, far surpassing the small population of 900. Officers were housed with families. [[Madison Barracks]] was later built at Sackett's Harbor as a fort on Lake Ontario.\n\nOn May 25, 1813, the American Lake Ontario squadron and Fort Niagara began bombarding [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=37}} An American amphibious force assaulted Fort George on the northern end of the Niagara River on May 27 and captured it without serious losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British also abandoned Fort Erie and headed towards the Burlington Heights.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British position was on the verge of collapse in Upper Canada; the Iroquois Indians considered changing sides and ignored a British appeal to come to their aid.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Americans did not pursue the retreating British forces, however, until they had largely escaped and organized a counter-offensive at the [[Battle of Stoney Creek]] on June 5. The British launched a surprise attack at Stoney Creek at 2 a.m., leading to much confused fighting{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} and a strategic British victory.\n\nThe Americans pulled back to Forty Mile Creek rather than continuing their advance into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} At this point, the Indians living on the Grand River reserve, many from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, began to come out to fight for the British, as an American victory no longer seemed inevitable.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Iroquois ambushed an American patrol at Forty Mile Creek, while the Royal Navy squadron based in Kingston sailed in and bombarded the American camp. General Dearborn retreated to Fort George, mistakenly believing that he was outnumbered and outgunned.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Brigadier General John Vincent was encouraged by the fact that more and more Indians were now arriving to assist him, providing about 800 additional men.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}}\n[[File:Laura Secord warns Fitzgibbons, 1813.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Secord]] providing advance warning to [[James FitzGibbon]], which led to a British-Indian victory at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], June 1813]]\nAn American force surrendered on June 24 to a smaller British force due to advance warning by [[Laura Secord]] at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Major General Francis de Rottenberg did not have the strength to retake Fort George, so he instituted a blockade, hoping to starve the Americans into surrender.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=44}} Meanwhile, Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack, which the Americans repulsed at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]]. Thereafter, Chauncey and Yeo's squadrons fought two indecisive actions, neither commander seeking a fight to the finish.\n\nLate in 1813, the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory that they occupied around Fort George. They set fire to the village of Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) on December 10, 1813, incensing the Canadians and politicians in control. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. The British retaliated following their [[Capture of Fort Niagara]] on December 18, 1813. The British and their Indian allies stormed the neighbouring town of [[Lewiston, New York]] on December 19, torching homes and killing about a dozen civilians. The British were pursuing the surviving residents when a small force of [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] warriors intervened, buying enough time for the civilians to escape to safer ground.{{sfn|Historic Lewiston, New}}{{sfn|Prohaska|2010}} The British attacked and burned [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on Lake Erie on December 30, 1813.\n\n====St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813====\nThe British were vulnerable over the stretch of the St. Lawrence between Upper Canada and the United States. Over the winter of 1812\u201313, the Americans launched a series of raids from [[Ogdensburg, New York]] which hampered British supply traffic up the river. On February 21, Sir George Pr\u00e9vost passed through [[Prescott, Ontario]] on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada. When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]], and the Americans were forced to retire.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|In October 1813, a force of Canadian [[Fencibles]], militiamen, and [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] repelled an American attempt to take Montreal at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River.]]]]\n\nThe Americans made two more thrusts against Montreal in 1813.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General [[James Wilkinson]] that would embark in boats and sail from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson, which limited his desire to support his plan. [[Charles de Salaberry]] defeated Hampton's force of 4,000 at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River]] on October 25 with a smaller force of [[Canadian Voltigeurs]] and [[Mohawks]]. Salaberry's force of Lower Canada militia and Indians numbered only 339, but had a strong defensive position.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on October 17 but was also delayed by bad weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain [[William Mulcaster]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Joseph Wanton Morrison]], and he was forced to land near [[Morrisburg, Ontario]] by November 10, about 150 kilometres (90&nbsp;mi) from Montreal. On November 11, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison's force of 800 at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] and was repulsed with heavy losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the U.S., and settled into winter quarters.

They had occupied southwestern Upper Canada after their victory in Moraviantown, and they believed that taking the rest of the province would force the British to cede it to them. The end of the war in Europe in April 1814 meant that the British could deploy their Army to North America, so the Americans were anxious to secure Upper Canada to negotiate from a position of strength. They planned to invade via the Niagara frontier while sending another force to recapture Mackinac;{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=47}} the British were supplying the Indians in the Old Northwest from Montreal via Mackinac.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=48}} They renewed their attack on the Niagara peninsula and quickly captured [[Fort Erie]] on July 3, 1814, with the garrison quickly surrendering to the Americans.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=49}} General Phineas Riall rushed towards the frontier, unaware of Fort Erie's fall or the size of the American force, and engaged in battle.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=49\u201350}} Winfield Scott then gained a victory over a British force at the [[Battle of Chippawa]] on July 5. The Americans brought out overwhelming firepower against the attacking British, who lost about 600 dead to the 350 dead on the American side. An attempt to advance further ended with a hard-fought but inconclusive [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] on July 25. Both sides stood their ground; American General Jacob Brown pulled back to Fort George after the battle, and the British did not pursue them.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=51}}\n[[File:British taking of the Northeast Bastion during the night assault on Fort Erie, August 14, 1814.png|thumb|British forces attempted to [[Siege of Fort Erie|storm Fort Erie]] on August 14, 1814 but were repelled by its American defenders.]]\nThe outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged [[Siege of Fort Erie]]. The British tried to storm Fort Erie on August 14, 1814 but suffered heavy losses, losing 950 killed, wounded, and captured compared to only 84 dead and wounded on the American side. The British were further weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines. Eventually they raised the siege, but American Major General [[George Izard]] took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. An American raid along the Grand River destroyed many farms and weakened British logistics. In October 1814, the Americans advanced into Upper Canada and engaged in skirmishes at Cook's Mill, but they pulled back when they heard that the new British warship HMS ''St. Lawrence'' was on its way, armed with 104 guns and launched in Kingston that September. The Americans lacked provisions and eventually destroyed Fort Erie and retreated across the Niagara.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=52}}\n\nMeanwhile, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington's ablest brigade commanders after Napoleon abdicated. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Pr\u00e9vost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor to gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Upper Lakes, and to defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives,{{sfn|Grodzinski|2010|pp=560\u2013561}} so he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], but he was worried about his flanks, so he decided that he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. The British squadron on the lake under Captain [[George Downie]] was more evenly matched by the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough \n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|Pr\u00e9vost's defeat at Plattsburgh led him to call off the invasion of New York.]]\n[[File:Flag of The Veteran Exempts of Battle of Plattsburgh.svg|thumb|Flag Flown at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nUpon reaching Plattsburgh, Pr\u00e9vost delayed the assault until Downie arrived in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate {{HMS|Confiance|1814|6}}. Pr\u00e9vost forced Downie into a premature attack but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later termed it \"the greatest naval battle of the war\".{{sfn|Roosevelt|1902 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n120/mode/1up 108]}} General [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]] led the successful land defence. Pr\u00e9vost then turned back, to the astonishment of his senior officers, saying that it was too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. He was recalled to London where a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Pr\u00e9vost urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. He died suddenly, just before his court-martial was to convene. His reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job but Pr\u00e9vost failed. Recent historians have been more kindly, however. Burroughs argues that his preparations were energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive for defending the Canadas with limited means, and he achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.{{sfn|Burroughs|1983}}\n\n[[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Hardy]] invaded the northern part of [[Massachusetts]] (Maine) on July 11 and took Fort Sullivan at [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].

[[Fort Belle Fontaine]] was an old trading post converted to an Army post in 1804, and this served as regional headquarters.

[[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] played a leadership role.{{sfn|Cole | 1921|pp= 69\u201374.}}\n\nLittle of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813, but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there. During the ensuing winter, a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McDouall]] established a new supply line from York to [[Nottawasaga Bay]] on [[Georgian Bay]]. He arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements, then sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the far west. The [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]] ended in a British victory on July 20, 1814.\n\nEarlier in July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and Indians ambushed them in the brief [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1814)|Battle of Mackinac Island]] and forced them to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay, and they destroyed its fortifications on August 13 along with the schooner [[Nancy (1789 ship)|''Nancy'']] that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On September 4, the gunboats were taken unawares and captured by British boarding parties from canoes and small boats. These [[Engagements on Lake Huron]] left Mackinac under British control.\n\nThe British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major [[Zachary Taylor]]. American troops retreating from the [[Battle of Credit Island]] on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at [[Fort Johnson]], but they soon abandoned the fort and most of the upper Mississippi valley.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=85\u201394}} In this distant theater, the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war through the allegiance of several Indian tribes that received British gifts and arms, enabling them to take control of parts of Michigan and Illinois and the whole of Wisconsin.{{sfn|Concise Historical Atlas|1998|p=85}}\n\nAmerican forces were driven from the Upper Mississippi region, but they held on to eastern Missouri and the St. Louis area.

Most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against French privateers, but the Royal Navy still had 85 vessels in American waters, counting all North American and Caribbean waters.{{efn|Admiralty reply to British press criticism{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=180}})}} However, the Royal Navy's American squadron based in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] numbered one small [[ship of the line]], seven [[frigate]]s, nine smaller [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[brig]]s, and five [[schooner]]s.{{sfn|Gwyn|2003|p=134}} By contrast, the United States Navy was composed of 8 frigates, 14 smaller sloops and brigs, and no ships of the line. The U.S. had embarked on a major shipbuilding program before the war at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and continued to produce new ships. Three of the existing American frigates were exceptionally large and powerful for their class, larger than any British frigate in America. The standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38 gun ship, usually carrying up to 50 guns, with its main battery consisting of 18-pounder. USS ''Constitution'', ''President'', and ''United States'', in comparison, were rated as 44-gun ships, carrying 56\u201360 guns with a main battery of 24-pounders.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=50}}\n\nThe British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping between Halifax and the West Indies, and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade. Because of their numerical inferiority, the American strategy was to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics, such as the capturing prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances. Days after the formal declaration of war, however, America put out two small squadrons, including the frigate ''President'' and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805|2}} under Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]], and the frigates ''United States'' and {{USS|Congress|1799|2}}, with the brig {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} under Captain [[Stephen Decatur]]. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, who intended to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force.\n\nLarge numbers of American merchant ships were returning to the United States with the outbreak of war, and the Royal Navy could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard if they were concentrated together. Rodgers' strategy worked, in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off [[New York Harbor]] under Captain [[Philip Broke]], allowing many American ships to reach home. But Rodgers' own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.{{sfn|Black|2008}}\n\n====Single-ship actions====\nBoth American and British naval honour had been challenged in the lead-up to the war. The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]] had left the United States insulted by the Royal Navy's impressment of sailors, and the appropriate method for the American Navy to redeem itself was by duelling. Similarly, British honour was challenged in the ''Little Belt'' affair where the United States frigate {{USS|President|1800|2}} fired on the British sloop {{HMS|Little Belt}} because ''President'' mistook ''Little Belt'' for the British frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}. Captain James Dacres of ''Guerriere'' began a cycle of frigate duels by challenging ''President'' to a single ship duel to avenge the losses aboard ''Little Belt''. Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]] of ''President'' declined the challenge because he feared that the rest of the British squadron under Commodore [[Philip Broke]] might intervene.{{sfn| Toll| 2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} {{sfn|James| 1817}}\n[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}} defeats {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} in a [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|single-ship engagement]].

On July 17, Commodore Broke's British squadron gave chase off New York, including ''Guerriere'', but ''Constitution'' evaded her pursuers after two days. Borke detached ''Guerriere'' from his squadron to seek out repairs, as she had weak scantlings (beams fastened with a thickened clamp rather than vertical and horizontal knees){{sfn|Gardiner|2000}} and had become leaky and rotten.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James|1817}} She had also been struck by lightning, severely damaging her masts.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Captain Dacres was eager to engage the American frigate and to redeem British honour, as ''Constitution'' was the sister ship of ''President'' and would serve equally well as an American ship to duel.

''Shannon'' had been at sea for a long time, and her hull had begun to rot, further exaggerating the disparity in scantling strength.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Nevertheless, this engagement proved to the only single-ship action where both ships were of essentially equal force during the War of 1812. British citizens reacted with celebration and relief that the run of American victories had ended.{{sfn|Forester|1970|pp=131\u2013132}} Notably, this action was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail due to the close-range engagement, the boarding (hand-to-hand combat) and Broke's philosophy of artillery being \"Kill the men and the ship is yours\", with more dead and wounded than HMS ''Victory'' suffered in four hours of combat at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Captain Lawrence was killed, and Captain Broke was so badly wounded that he never again held a sea command.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=61}} The Americans then did as the British had done in 1812 and banned single-ship duels after this engagement.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n[[File:George-ropes-battle-of-valparaiso.png|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso]] ended the American naval threat to British interests in the south [[Pacific Ocean]].]]\nIn January 1813, the American frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|2}}, under the command of Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], sailed into the Pacific to harass British shipping.

Unlike the previous engagements, ''President'' was not taken in a duel. Following the both Royal Navy's requirements, ''President'' was pursued by a squadron consisting of four frigates, one being a 56-gun razee. ''President'' was an extremely fast ship and successfully outsailed the fast British squadron with the exception of {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} which has been regarded as the fastest ship in the age of fighting sail.{{sfn|Gardiner |2000}}{{Verify source|date=February 2019}} Captain Henry Hope of ''Endymion'' had fitted his ship with Phillip Broke's technology as Captain Hillyar had done on ''Phoebe''. This gave him the slight advantage at range and slowed ''President''. Commodore Decatur on ''President'' had the advantage in scantling strength, firepower, crew, and tonnage, but not in maneuverability. Despite having fewer guns, ''Endymion'' was armed with 24-pounders just like ''President''. This meant that ''Endymion'' shot could pierce the hull of ''President'' unlike ''Guerriere''{{'}}s which bounced of ''Constitution''{{'}}s hull or ''Java''{{'}}s that failed to cut through ''Constitution''{{'}}s mast.

Decatur surrendered without a fight.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} Decatur had surrendered the United States finest frigate and flagship ''President'' to a smaller ship, but part of a squadron of greater force.\n\nDecatur gave unreliable accounts of the battle stating that ''President'' was already \"severely damaged\" by a grounding before the engagement, but undamaged after the engagement with ''Endymion''. He stated ''Pomone'' caused \"significant\" losses aboard ''President'', although ''President''{{'}}s crew claim they were below deck gathering their belongings as they had already surrendered. Despite saying \"I surrender my ship to the captain of the black frigate\", Decatur also writes that he said, \"I surrender to the squadron\". Nevertheless, many historians such as Ian Toll, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] quote Decatur's remarks to either enforce that ''Endymion'' alone took ''President'' or that ''President'' surrendered to the whole squadron, when actually it was something in-between.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\nSuccess in single ship battles raised American morale after the repeated failed invasion attempts in Upper and Lower Canada.

American privateers reported taking 1300 British merchant vessels, compared to 254 taken by the U.S. Navy,{{sfn|American Merchant Marine}}{{sfn|Franklin}}{{sfn|Brewer |2004}} although the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802.{{sfn|Latimer|2007 |p= 242}} The Canadian historian Carl Benn wrote that American privateers took 1,344 British ships, of which 750 were retaken by the British.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However the British were able to limit privateering losses by the strict enforcement of [[convoy]] by the Royal Navy and by capturing 278 American privateers. Due to the massive size of the British merchant fleet, American captures only affected 7.5% of the fleet, resulting in no supply shortages or lack of reinforcements for British forces in North America.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|pp=394\u2013395}} Of 526 American privateers, 148 were captured by the Royal Navy and only 207 ever took a prize.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}}\n\nDue to the large size of their navy, the British did not rely as much on privateering. The majority of the 1,407 captured American merchant ships were taken by the Royal Navy. The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. However privateering remained popular in British colonies. It was the last hurrah for privateers in [[Bermuda]] who vigorously returned to the practice after experience in previous wars.{{sfn|Strannack|1909|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}}}} The nimble [[Bermuda sloop]]s captured 298 American ships. Privateer schooners based in [[British North America]], especially from [[Nova Scotia]] took 250 American ships and proved especially effective in crippling American coastal trade and capturing American ships closer to shore than the Royal Navy cruisers.{{sfn|Faye|1997|p=171}}\n\n====Blockade====\n[[File:Principal Campaigns of the War of 1812.gif|left|thumb|A map of the American coastline. British naval strategy was to protect their shipping in North America, and enforce a naval blockade on the U.S.]]\nThe [[Blockade|naval blockade]] of the United States began informally in 1812 and expanded to cut off more ports as the war progressed.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah and New York City as well.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However, as additional ships were sent to North America in 1813, the Royal Navy was able to tighten the blockade and extend it, first to the coast south of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon, and the end of the supply problems with Wellington's army, New England was blockaded.{{sfn| Grodzinski}}\n\nThe British government, having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain, benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them, so no blockade of New England was at first attempted.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} The [[Delaware River]] and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on December 26, 1812. Illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the U.S. government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading; this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=849}}\n\nThe blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port.

Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|opposition to the war]]. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130&nbsp;million in 1807 to $7&nbsp;million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies.{{sfn|Leckie|1998|p=255}} The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=56\u201357}} The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}}<ref>\"War of 1812.\" in ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History,'' edited by Thomas Riggs, (2nd ed., vol. 3, Gale, 2015), pp. 1446-1449.

The blockading British fleet in [[Chesapeake Bay]] received increasing numbers of enslaved black Americans during 1813.

About 2,400 of the escaped slaves and their families who were carried on ships of the Royal Navy following their escape settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] during and after the war. From May 1814, younger men among the volunteers were recruited into a new [[Corps of Colonial Marines]]. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] and the attacks on Washington, D.C. and Battle of Baltimore, later settling in Trinidad after rejecting British government orders for transfer to the [[West India Regiments]], forming the community of the [[Merikins]]. The slaves who escaped to the British represented the largest emancipation of African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Black Sailors Soldiers|2012}}\n\n====Occupation of Maine====\nMaine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U.S. and the British. Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast. In September 1813, there was a notable naval action when the U.S. Navy's brig {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}} [[Capture of HMS Boxer|fought and captured]] the Royal Navy brig {{HMS|Boxer|1812|2}} off Pemaquid Point.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=75\u201391}} The first British assault came in July 1814, when Sir [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]] took Moose Island ([[Eastport, Maine]]) without a shot, with the entire American garrison of [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]]\u2014which became the British Fort Sherbrooke\u2014surrendering.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=81\u201394}} Next, from his base in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in September 1814, Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]] led 3,000 British troops in the \"Penobscot Expedition\". In 26 days, he raided and looted [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the [[Battle of Hampden]] (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed). Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|2}}. The British occupied the town of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war, re-establishing the colony of [[New Ireland (Maine)|New Ireland]]. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States, though [[Machias Seal Island]] has remained in dispute. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took \u00a310,750 obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the \"Castine Fund\", was used to establish [[Dalhousie University]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Harvey|1938|pp=207\u2013213}}\n\n===={{anchor|Chesapeake Campaign|Expedition to the Chesapeake}}Chesapeake campaign and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nThe strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America's new national capital, Washington, D.C. on the major tributary of the [[Potomac River]], made it a prime target for the British. Starting in March 1813, a squadron under Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] started a blockade of the mouth of the Bay at [[Hampton Roads]] harbour and raided towns along the Bay from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to [[Raid on Havre de Grace|Havre de Grace, Maryland]].\n[[File:British Burning Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Following their victory at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], the British entered Washington, D.C., [[Burning of Washington|burning down buildings]] including the [[White House]].]]\nOn July 4, 1813, Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], a Revolutionary War naval hero, convinced the Navy Department to build the [[Chesapeake Bay Flotilla]], a squadron of twenty barges powered by small sails or oars (sweeps) to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered in the [[Patuxent River]], and while successful in harassing the Royal Navy, they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the \"[[Burning of Washington]]\". This expedition, led by Cockburn and General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]], was carried out between August 19 and 29, 1814, as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814. As part of this, Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral Alexander Cochrane, with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace.\n\nA force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard {{HMS|Royal Oak|1809|6}}, three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the [[Peninsular War]] by victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Pr\u00e9vost's request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at the national capital.\n\nOn August 24, U.S. Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr]]. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even when British army and naval units were obviously on their way to Washington. The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg, opening the route to Washington. While First Lady [[Dolley Madison]] saved valuables from what is now the \"[[White House]]\", senior officials fled to Virginia. {{sfn|Defense Burning of}} Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]] ordered setting fire to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to prevent the capture of supplies.{{sfn|Herrick|2005|page=90}} The nation's public buildings were destroyed by the British (and by a furious thunderstorm that ruined a great deal of property, although it did quench the flames).

Watching the bombardment from a truce ship, [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write the four-stanza poem that later became, ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''.]]\nThe British moved on to their major target, the heavily fortified major city of Baltimore. They delayed their movement allowing Baltimore an opportunity to strengthen the fortifications and bring in new federal troops and state militia units. The \"[[Battle of Baltimore|Battle for Baltimore]]\" began with the British landing on September 12, 1814, at [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|North Point]], where they were met by American militia further up the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. The British Army commander Major Gen. [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] was killed by snipers. The British paused, then continued to march northwestward to face the stationed Maryland and Baltimore City militia units at \"Godly Wood.\" The [[Battle of North Point]] was fought for several afternoon hours in a musketry and artillery duel. The British also planned to simultaneously attack Baltimore by water on the following day, September 13, to support their military facing the massed, heavily dug-in and fortified American units of approximately 15,000 with about a hundred cannon gathered along the eastern heights of the city named \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later \"Hampstead Hill\" \u2013 now part of [[Patterson Park]]). The Baltimore defences had been planned in advance and overseen by the state militia commander, Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]]. The Royal Navy was unable to reduce [[Fort McHenry]] at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor in support of an attack from the northeast by the British Army.\n\nThe British naval guns, mortars and new \"[[Congreve rockets]]\" had a longer range than the American cannon onshore. The ships mostly stood out of range of the Americans, who returned very little fire. The fort was not heavily damaged except for a burst over a rear brick wall knocking out some field pieces but with few casualties. The British eventually realized that they could not force the passage to attack Baltimore in coordination with the land force. A last ditch night feint and barge attack during a heavy rain storm was led by Capt. [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] around the fort up the Middle Branch of the river to the west. Split and misdirected partly in the storm, it turned back after suffering heavy casualties from the alert gunners of [[Fort Covington]] and [[Battery Babcock]]. The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] to write \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", a poem that was later set to music as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|2015|pp=599\u2013629}}\n\n===Southern theater===\nBecause of the region's polyglot population, both the British and the Americans perceived the war in the Gulf South as a fundamentally different conflict from the one occurring in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and Chesapeake.{{sfn|Millett|2013}}{{rp|31}}\n\n====Creek War====\n{{Main|Creek War}}\nBefore 1813, the war between the Creeks (or [[Muscogee]]) had been largely an internal affair sparked by the ideas of Tecumseh farther north in the Mississippi Valley. A faction known as the [[Red Sticks]], so named for the colour of their war stics, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. The Red Sticks were allied with Tecumseh, who about a year before 1813 had visited the Creeks and encouraged greater resistance to the Americans.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=23\u201325}} The Creek Nation was a trading partner of the United States, actively involved with Spanish and British trade as well. The Red Sticks, as well as many southern Muscogeean people like the [[Seminole]], had a long history of alliance with the Spanish and British Empires.{{sfn|Braund | 1993}} This alliance helped the North American and European powers protect each other's claims to territory in the south.{{sfn|Hurt |2002}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Burnt Corn]], between [[Red Sticks]] and U.S. troops, occurred in the southern parts of Alabama on July 27, 1813. It prompted the state of Georgia as well as the Mississippi territory militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives. The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the [[Alabama River|Alabama]], [[Coosa River|Coosa]], and [[Tallapoosa River]]s \u2013 Upper Creek territory. The Lower Creek lived along the [[Chattahoochee River]]. Many Creeks tried to remain friendly to the United States, and some were organized by federal Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]] to aid the 6th Military District under [[Thomas Pinckney|General Thomas Pinckney]] and the state militias. The United States combined forces were large.

The army, led by [[John Floyd (Georgia politician)|General John Floyd]], went to the heart of the \"Creek Holy Grounds\" and won a major offensive against one of the largest Creek towns at [[Battle of Autosee]], killing an estimated two hundred people.

The main focus on British foreign policy was the Congress of Vienna, during which British diplomats had clashed with Russian and Prussian diplomats over the terms of the peace with France, and there were fears that Britain might have go to war with Russia and Prussia. Now each side was tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed and after Napoleon fell in 1814 France was no longer an enemy of Britain, so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France, and it no longer needed to impress more seamen. It had ended the practices that so angered the Americans in 1812. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon.{{sfn|Mahan|1905}}\n\nBritish negotiators were urged by Lord Liverpool to offer a ''status quo'' and dropped their demands for the creation of an Indian barrier state, which was in any case hopeless after the collapse of Tecumseh's alliance. This allowed negotiations to resume at the end of October. British diplomats soon offered the ''status quo'' to the U.S. negotiators, who accepted them. Prisoners were to be exchanged and captured slaves returned to the United States or paid for by Britain. At this point, the number of slaves was approximately 6,000. Britain eventually refused the demand, allowing many to either emigrate to Canada or Trinidad.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn December 24, 1814 the diplomats had finished and signed the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27{{sfnm|1a1=Hickey|1y=2006|1p=295|2a1=Updyke|2y=1915|2p=360|3a1=Perkins|3y=1964|3pp=129\u2013130}} and arrived in Washington on February 17, where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, thus finally ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent failed to secure official British acknowledgement of American maritime rights or ending impressment. However, in the century of peace until World War I these rights were not seriously violated. The defeat of Napoleon made irrelevant all of the naval issues over which the United States had fought. The Americans had achieved their goal of ending the Indian threat; furthermore the American armies had scored enough victories (especially at New Orleans) to satisfy honour and the sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=208\u20139}}\n\n==Losses and compensation==\n{|align=right class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''''Casualties in the War of 1812'''''\n|-\n!

The Treaty of Ghent established the ''status quo ante bellum''; that is, there were no territorial losses by either side. The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy, no longer needing sailors, stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon in spring 1814 ended the war. (Napoleon unexpectedly returned in 1815, after the final end of the war of 1812.)\n\nThe long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory to both sides. Except for occasional border disputes and some tensions during the [[American Civil War]], relations between the U.S. and Britain remained peaceful for the rest of the 19th century, and the two countries became [[Special Relationship|close allies]] in the 20th century. Historian Troy Bickham argues that each participant defined success in a different way. The new American Republic could claim victory in the sense that its independence from London was assured, and the Indian barrier to Westward expansion was removed. The memory of the conflict played a major role in helping to consolidate a Canadian national identity after 1867. The British retained Canada, but their attention was overwhelmingly devoted to celebrating the defeat of Napoleon. The general consensus is that the Native Americans were the big losers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy Bickham|title=The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM755oY5k98C&pg=PT262|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=262\u201380|isbn=9780199942626}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] between the United States and Britain was enacted in 1817. It demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary. It remains in effect to this day.\n\nAlthough Britain had defeated the American invasions of Canada, its own invasions were defeated in Maryland, New York and Louisiana. After two decades of intense warfare against France, Britain was in no mood to have more conflicts with the United States. Instead it focused on expanding the British Empire into India. Britain never seriously challenged the US over land claims after 1846: it had hoped to keep Texas Independent from the United States and had some hopes of taking California from Mexico. From the 1890s, as the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial power, Britain wanted American friendship in a hypothetical European war. Border adjustments between the U.S. and British North America were made in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]], Massachusetts, was returned to the U.S. in 1818; [[Missouri Compromise|it became part]] of the new State of [[Maine]] in 1820. A border dispute along the Maine\u2013New Brunswick border was settled by the 1842 [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] after the bloodless [[Aroostook War]], and the border in the [[Oregon Country]] was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]]. A further dispute about the line of the border through the island in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] resulted in another almost bloodless standoff in the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] of 1859. The line of the border was finally settled by an international arbitration commission in 1872.\n\n===Bermuda===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nBermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before U.S. independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795, as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports. It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron, but the war saw it rise to a new prominence. As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters, housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard. The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment, heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the \"Gibraltar of the West\". Defence infrastructure remained the central leg of Bermuda's economy until after World War II.\n\n===The Canadas===\n[[File:Fort Henry, Kingston.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston in 1836.

In the decades following the war, several projects were undertaken to improve the defence of the colonies against the United States. They include work on [[La Citadelle]] at [[Quebec City]], [[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston, and rebuilding [[Fort York]] at York. Additionally, work began on the [[Halifax Citadel]] to defend the port against foreign navies. From 1826 to 1832, the Rideau Canal was built to provide a secure waterway not at risk from American cannon fire. To defend the western end of the canal, the British Army also built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] at Kingston.{{sfn|Hayes|2008|p=117}}\n\n===Indigenous nations===\nThe Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause. The British proposal to create a \"neutral\" Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced. After 1814 the natives, who lost most of their fur-gathering territory, became an undesirable burden to British policymakers. The latter now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}} The United States further disrupted trade along the northern border by prohibiting British fur traders from operating in the US, whereas before the war, both populations had freely moved back and forth across the border.\n\nBritish agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former American Indian partners, but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no American Indian campaigns to stop U.S. expansionism in the Midwest. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, American Great Lakes\u2013area Indians ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}}\n\n===Great Britain===\nThe war is seldom remembered in Great Britain. The massive ongoing conflict in Europe against the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] ensured that the British did not consider the War of 1812 against America as more than a sideshow.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=304}} Britain's blockade of French trade had been entirely successful, and the Royal Navy was the world's dominant nautical power (and remained so for another century). While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the U.S. Navy in port, and widely suppressed privateering. British businesses, some affected by rising insurance costs, were demanding peace so that trade could resume with the U.S.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Latimer|2y=2009|2p=88}} The peace was generally welcomed by the British, though there was disquiet about the rapid growth of the U.S. However, the two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and, over time, a growing friendship.{{sfn|Stearns|2008|p=547}}\n\nHickey argues that for Britain:\n{{quote|the most important lesson of all [was] that the best way to defend Canada was to accommodate the United States. This was the principal rationale for Britain's long-term policy of rapprochement with the United States in the nineteenth century and explains why they were so often willing to sacrifice other imperial interests to keep the republic happy.{{sfn|Hickey|2014}}}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:4th-of-July-1819-Philadelphia-John-Lewis-Krimmel.JPG|thumb|[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in 1819.

Several war heroes used their fame to win election to national office. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both took advantage of their military successes to win the presidency, while Richard Mentor Johnson used his wartime exploits to help attain the vice presidency.\n\nDuring the war, New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them. They complained that the U.S. government was not investing enough in the states' defences militarily and financially, and that the states should have more control over their militias. The increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=255ff}} As a result, at the [[Hartford Convention]] (December 1814{{snd}}January 1815) Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared at the same time that peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known. The upshot was that the Federalists were permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.{{sfn|Cogliano|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnJJ-GDktHgC&pg=PA234 234]}}\n\nThis war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked at the sight of their slaves fleeing, risking so much to be free.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The British aided numerous Black Refugees in resettling in New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, where [[Black Loyalists]] had also been granted land after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat of the Creek Indians at the battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, some Creek warriors escaped to join the [[Seminole]] in Florida, who had been forming as an ethnic group since the late 18th century. The remaining Creek chiefs signed away about half their lands, comprising 23,000,000 acres, covering much of southern Georgia and two thirds of modern Alabama. The Creek were separated from any future help from the Spanish in Florida, and from the Choctaw and Chickasaw to the west. During the war the United States seized [[Mobile, Alabama]], which was a strategic location as it provided an oceanic outlet for export from the cotton lands to the north.  Most were yet to be developed, but US control of this territory increased pressure on remaining Creek, as European Americans began to migrate in number into the area.\n\nJackson invaded Florida in 1818, demonstrating to Spain that it could no longer control that territory with a small force. Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] following the [[First Seminole War]]. Pratt concludes:\n\n{{quote|Thus indirectly the War of 1812 brought about the acquisition of Florida.... To both the Northwest and the South, therefore, the War of 1812 brought substantial benefits. It broke the power of the Creek Confederacy and opened to settlement a great province of the future Cotton Kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p= 138.}}}}\n\n==Memory and historiography==\n===Popular views===\nDuring the 19th century, residents of both the United States and Canada widely believed that their own countries had won the war. Each young country saw its self-perceived victory, and settling of the border between them, as an important foundation of its growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute, a distraction from the principal task at hand.\n\n===American===\nWhile American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814,{{sfn|Defense Burning of}} which necessitated its extensive renovation, it focused on the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburg, and New Orleans to present the war as a successful effort to assert American national honour, the \"second war of independence\" in which the mighty British empire was humbled and humiliated.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=82\u201383}} In a speech before Congress on February 18, 1815, President [[James Madison]] proclaimed the war a complete American victory.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nThis interpretation of the war was and remains the dominant American view of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} The American newspaper the ''Niles Register'', in an editorial on September 14, 1816, announced that the Americans had crushed the British, declaring \"...we did virtually dictate the treaty of Ghent to the British\".{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} A minority of Americans, mostly associated with the Federalists, considered the war a defeat and an act of folly on Madison's part, caustically asking if the Americans were \"dictating\" the terms of the treaty of Ghent, why the British Crown did not cede British North America to the United States?{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} However, the Federalist view of the war is not the mainstream American memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} Congressman [[George Troup]], who said in a speech in 1815 that the Treaty of Ghent was \"the glorious termination of the most glorious war ever waged by any people\", expressed American popular opinion and memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nAmericans also celebrated the successful American defence of [[Fort McHenry]] in September 1814, which inspired the lyrics of what was adopted as the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".{{sfn|Star-Spangled Banner War}} The successful captains of the U.S. Navy became popular heroes, and commemorative plates were produced with the likenesses of Decatur, Issac Hull, and [[Charles Stewart (1778\u20131869)|Charles Stewart]] on them, becoming popular items. Many of these plates were manufactured in England. The navy became a cherished institution, lauded for the victories that it won against all odds.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=456}} After engagements during the final actions of the war, U.S. Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as excellent marksmen, especially in ship-to-ship actions. {{sfn|Simmons|2003}}\n\n===Canadian===\n[[File:Couplandart.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Douglas Coupland]]'s '[[Monument to the War of 1812]]' (2008) in Toronto; depicts a larger-than-life Canadian soldier triumphing over an American; both are depicted as metallic toy soldiers of the sort small children play with.]]\n\nIn British North America, the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory, as they had claimed they had successfully defended their country from an American takeover.{{sfn|Kaufman|1997|pp=110\u2013135}} A long-term consequence of the Canadian militia's success was the view, widely held in Canada at least until the First World War, that Canada did not need a regular professional army.{{sfn|Cmh: Origins of|2007}} While Canadian militia units had played instrumental roles in several engagements, such as at the Battle of the Chateauguay, it was the regular units of the British Army, including its \"Fencible\" regiments which were recruited within North America, which ensured that Canada was successfully defended.\n\nThe U.S. Army had done poorly, on the whole, in several attempts to invade Canada, and the Canadians had fought bravely to defend their territory. But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would remain vulnerable in a third war. \"We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again\", Admiral Sir [[David Milne (Royal Navy officer)|David Milne]] wrote to a correspondent in 1817,{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=458\u2013459}} although the [[Rideau Canal]] was built for just such a scenario.\n\nBy the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain,{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=1}} although still remembered in Canada, especially Ontario. In a 2009 poll, 37% of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory, 9% said the U.S. won, 15% called it a draw, and 39% said they knew too little to comment.{{sfn|Boswell|2009}} A 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians' identity, the belief that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second (25%).{{sfn|Ipsos Reid}}\n\n===Historians' views===\nHistorians have differing and complex interpretations of the war.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the \"real winners\" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascos and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failures to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British attack on New Orleans and upstate New York.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=74}}\n\nHowever, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and retaining their Canadian colonies. In contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the U.S. lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, arguing that the U.S. actions had no effect on the Orders in Council, which were rescinded before the war started.{{sfnm|1a1=Benn|1y=2002|p=83|2a1=Latimer|2y=2007|2p=3}}\n\nHistorian Troy Bickham, author of ''The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812'', sees the British as having fought to a much stronger position than the United States.\n\n<blockquote>Even tied down by ongoing wars with Napoleonic France, the British had enough capable officers, well-trained men, and equipment to easily defeat a series of American invasions of Canada. In fact, in the opening salvos of the war, the American forces invading Upper Canada were pushed so far back that they ended up surrendering Michigan Territory. The difference between the two navies was even greater. While the Americans famously (shockingly for contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic) bested British ships in some one-on-one actions at the war's start, the Royal Navy held supremacy throughout the war, blockading the U.S. coastline and ravaging coastal towns, including Washington, D.C. Yet in late 1814, the British offered surprisingly generous peace terms despite having amassed a large invasion force of veteran troops in Canada, naval supremacy in the Atlantic, an opponent that was effectively bankrupt, and an open secessionist movement in New England.</blockquote>\n\nHe considers that the British offered the United States generous terms, in place of their initially harsh terms (which included massive forfeiture of land to Canada and the American Indians), because the \"reigning Liverpool ministry in Britain held a loose grip on power and feared the war-weary, tax-exhausted public\". The war was also technically a British victory \"because the United States failed to achieve the aims listed in its declaration of war\".{{sfn|Bickham|2017}}\n\nA second minority view is that both the U.S. and Britain won the war\u2014that is, both achieved their main objectives, as the U.S. restored its independence and honour, and opened the way to westward expansion, while Britain defeated Napoleon and ruled the seas.{{sfn|Turner |2000}} American historian Norman K. Risjord argues that the main motivation was restoring the nation's honour in the face of relentless British aggression toward American neutral rights on the high seas, and in the Western lands. The results in terms of honour satisfied the War Hawks.{{sfn|Risjord|1961| pp=196\u2013210}} American historian Donald Hickey asks, \"Did the cost in blood and treasure justify the U.S. decision to go to war? Most Republicans thought it did. In the beginning they called the contest a 'second war of independence', and while Britain's maritime practices never truly threatened the Republic's independence, the war did in a broad sense vindicate U.S. sovereignty. But it ended in a draw on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction}} Historians argue that it was an American success to end the threat of Indian raids, kill the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary, and hereby to open an unimpeded path for westward expansion.{{efn|''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' concludes, \"British plans for an American Indian buffer state were dropped, and American Indian nations within U.S. borders lost their last major remaining European diplomatic partner, clearing a path for American westward expansion.\"{{sfn|Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|page=343}}&nbsp;}} [[Winston Churchill]] concluded:\n<blockquote>The lessons of the war were taken to heart. Anti-American feeling in Great Britain ran high for several years, but the United States were never again refused proper treatment as an independent power.{{sfn|Churchill|1958|page=366}}</blockquote>\n\nAmerican naval historian George C. Daughan argues that the US achieved enough of its war goals to claim a victorious result of the conflict, and subsequent impact it had on the negotiations in Ghent. Daughan uses official correspondences from President Madison to the delegates at Ghent strictly prohibiting negotiations with regards to maritime law, stating:{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=328}}\n\n<blockquote>Madison's latest dispatches [arrived July 25\u201327, 1814] permitted them [the delegates] to simply ignore the entire question of maritime rights. Free trade with liberated Europe had already been restored, and the Admiralty no longer needed impressment to man its warships. The president felt that with Europe at peace the issues of neutral trading rights and impressment could safely be set aside in the interests of obtaining peace... Thus, from the start of the negotiations, the disagreements that started the war and sustained it were acknowledged by both parties to be no longer important.</blockquote>\n\nThe British permanently stopped impressing Americans, although they never publicly rescinding the possibility of resuming that practice. The US delegates at the meeting understood it to be a dead issue after the 1814 surrender of Napoleon.{{sfn|Rutland | 1994 | p=200}} In addition, the successful defence of Baltimore, Plattsburgh, and Fort Erie (a strategic fortress located in Upper Canada on the Niagara River, and occupied during the third and most successful offensive into Canada) had very favorable influence on the negotiations for the Americans and prompted several famous responses from both sides. Henry Clay wrote to the delegates in October 1814, \"for in our own country, my dear sir, at last must we conquer the peace.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=353}} With growing pressure in Britain, the Duke of Wellington, when asked to command the forces in America, wrote to Liverpool on November 9, 1814, \"I confess that I think you have no right, from the state of the war, to demand any concession of territory from America&nbsp;... You have not been able to carry&nbsp;... [the war] into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack [Fort Erie]&nbsp;... Why Stipulate for ''uti possidetis''?\"{{sfn|Mills|1921|pp=19\u201332}} The argument that the US failed to capture any Canadian territory that influenced the negotiations is an outdated and highly criticized position, argues Daughan. He cites the ''Edinburgh Review'', a British newspaper, who had remained silent about the war with America for two years, wrote \"the British government had embarked on a war of conquest, after the American government had dropped its maritime demands, and the British had lost. It was folly to attempt to invade and conquer the United States. To do so would result in the same tragedy as the first war against them, and with the same result.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=359}}\n\n====National bias of historians====\nHistorians have different views on who won the War of 1812, and there is an element of national bias to this.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} British and Canadian historians follow the view that the war was a British victory, and some US historians also support this view. {{sfn|Boswell|2011}} The opposing position, held by most US historians along with some Canadians and British, is that the result was a stalemate. Only US historians follow the minority view that the US was the victorious party in the war.{{sfn|Hattendorf|2012}}{{sfn|Simon|2012}}{{sfn|Boswell|2011}}{{sfn|Foreman|2014}} Similarly, a survey of school textbooks found that historians from Canada, Britain, and the United States emphasize different aspects of the war according to their national narratives; some British texts will scarcely mention the war.''{{sfn|Mowat|1965|p=35}}''\n\n====Indians as losers====\nHistorians generally agree that the real losers of the War of 1812 were the Indians (called First Nations in Canada). Hickey says:\n\n{{quote|The big losers in the war were the Indians. As a proportion of their population, they had suffered the heaviest casualties. Worse, they were left without any reliable European allies in North America&nbsp;... The crushing defeats at the Thames and Horseshoe Bend left them at the mercy of the Americans, hastening their confinement to reservations and the decline of their traditional way of life.{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction. |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2bBHL2ePWcC&pg=PT22 22]}}{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|page=23}}{{sfn|Bowman|Greenblatt|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Kessel|Wooster|2005|page=145}}}}\n[[File:Jackson and Weatherford.jpg|thumb|[[William Weatherford]] surrendering to Andrew Jackson at the end of the Creek War. The peace imposed on the Creek saw them cede half of their territory to the United States.]]\nThe Indians of the Old Northwest (the modern Midwest) had hoped to create an Indian state to be a British protectorate.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}} American settlers into the Middle West had been repeatedly blocked and threatened by Indian raids before 1812, and that now came to an end. Throughout the war the British had played on terror of the tomahawks and scalping knives of their Indian allies; it worked especially at Hull's surrender at Detroit. By 1813 Americans had killed Tecumseh and broken his coalition of tribes. Jackson then defeated the Creek in the Southwest. Historian John Sugden notes that in both theaters, the Indians' strength had been broken prior to the arrival of the major British forces in 1814.{{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=311}} The one campaign that the Americans had decisively won was the campaign in the Old Northwest, which put the British in a weak hand to insist upon an Indian state in the Old Northwest.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}}\n\nNotwithstanding the sympathy and support from commanders (such as Brock,{{efn|{{harvtxt|Sugden|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} mentions that 'Brock had urged the British government to protect his Indian allies in peace negotiations, and by the end of 1812 he had obtained from Earl Bathurst, colonial secretary, a promise to that effect.'}} Cochrane and Nicolls), the policymakers in London reneged in assisting the Indians, as making peace was a higher priority for the politicians. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but, although the British and their Indian allies maintained control over the territories in question (i.e. most of the [[Upper Midwest]]), British diplomats did not press the demand after an American refusal, effectively abandoning their Indian allies. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]).{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=435\u2013439}} In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had \"enduring and massive consequences\".{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=421}} It gave the Americans \"continental predominance\" while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=437}}\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent technically required the United States to cease hostilities and \"forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\"; the United States ignored this article of the treaty and proceeded to expand into this territory regardless; Britain was unwilling to provoke further war to enforce it. A shocked [[Henry Goulburn]], one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked:\n\n{{quote|Till I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.{{sfn|Treaty of Ghent}}}}\n\nThe Creek War came to an end, with the Treaty of Fort Jackson being imposed upon the Indians. About half of the Creek territory was ceded to the United States, with no payment made to the Creeks. This was, in theory, invalidated by Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent. {{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=304}} The British failed to press the issue, and did not take up the Indian cause as an infringement of an international treaty. Without this support, the Indians' lack of power was apparent and the stage was set for further incursions of territory by the United States in subsequent decades.

At Jefferson's urging, the governing board of visitors of William & Mary established a chair of law and appointed [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], and Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]], its first holder. (In the English-speaking world, older law professorships include the chair at [[Oxford University]], first held by [[William Blackstone]], the chair at [[Edinburgh University]]'s School of Law (1709), and the [[Regius Professor of Law (Glasgow)|Regius Chair of Law]] at [[Glasgow University]]). [[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Statue of Marshall and Wythe at the entrance of the Law School]]\n\nBefore filling the chair of law at William & Mary, Wythe tutored numerous students in the subject, [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]] among them. [[John Marshall]], who became [[Chief Justice of the United States]] in 1801, received his only formal legal education when he attended Wythe's lectures at William & Mary in 1780. [[St. George Tucker]], who succeeded Wythe as Professor of Law and edited the seminal early American edition of [[Blackstone's Commentaries]], also was one of Wythe's students.\n\nThe growth of the Law School was halted abruptly by the beginning of the [[American Civil War]]. The start of military campaigns on the Virginia Peninsula compelled William & Mary to close its doors. It would be another sixty years before the historical priority in law could be revived in a modern program that is now nearly ninety years old.\n\nAfter William & Mary Law School was reopened early in the twentieth century, it was moved around the main campus of the university to several different buildings in succession.  In 1980, the School was moved to its current location on the outskirts of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], a short distance from the main campus.  The building has been renovated several times since 1980, with the addition of a new wing of classrooms and renovation of older classrooms in 2000, the opening of the [[Henry C. Wolf Law Library]], the construction of a new admission suite, and the addition of the James A. and Robin L. Hixon Center for Experiential Learning and Leadership (dedicated in 2017).\n\n[[W. Taylor Reveley III]], formerly managing partner of the law firm of [[Hunton & Williams]], is a former dean of the Law School.

Located in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], Virginia, it is a part of [[College of William & Mary|William & Mary]], the second oldest college and first university in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/index.php |title=William & Mary - About |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref> The Law School has an enrollment of 645 full-time students (in 2018\u201319) seeking a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) or an LL.M. in the American Legal System, a two or three semester program for lawyers trained outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://law.wm.edu/about/factoids/index.php |title=At a Glance |publisher=law.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWilliam & Mary Law School was founded in 1779 at the impetus of [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], an alumnus of the university, during the reorganization of the originally royal institution, transforming the college of William and Mary into the first university in the United States.  At Jefferson's urging, the governing board of visitors of William & Mary established a chair of law and appointed [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], and Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]], its first holder. (In the English-speaking world, older law professorships include the chair at [[Oxford University]], first held by [[William Blackstone]], the chair at [[Edinburgh University]]'s School of Law (1709), and the [[Regius Professor of Law (Glasgow)|Regius Chair of Law]] at [[Glasgow University]]). [[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Statue of Marshall and Wythe at the entrance of the Law School]]\n\nBefore filling the chair of law at William & Mary, Wythe tutored numerous students in the subject, [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]] among them. [[John Marshall]], who became [[Chief Justice of the United States]] in 1801, received his only formal legal education when he attended Wythe's lectures at William & Mary in 1780. [[St. George Tucker]], who succeeded Wythe as Professor of Law and edited the seminal early American edition of [[Blackstone's Commentaries]], also was one of Wythe's students.\n\nThe growth of the Law School was halted abruptly by the beginning of the [[American Civil War]]. The start of military campaigns on the Virginia Peninsula compelled William & Mary to close its doors. It would be another sixty years before the historical priority in law could be revived in a modern program that is now nearly ninety years old.\n\nAfter William & Mary Law School was reopened early in the twentieth century, it was moved around the main campus of the university to several different buildings in succession.  In 1980, the School was moved to its current location on the outskirts of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], a short distance from the main campus.  The building has been renovated several times since 1980, with the addition of a new wing of classrooms and renovation of older classrooms in 2000, the opening of the [[Henry C. Wolf Law Library]], the construction of a new admission suite, and the addition of the James A. and Robin L. Hixon Center for Experiential Learning and Leadership (dedicated in 2017).\n\n[[W. Taylor Reveley III]], formerly managing partner of the law firm of [[Hunton & Williams]], is a former dean of the Law School. He served as the 27th president of William & Mary from September 5, 2008 to June 30, 2018, after serving as interim president since February 2008.  Davison M.

Facilities are on the historic campus of [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Sydney Lewis|Sydney Lewis Hall]]. W&L Law has a total enrollment of approximately 365 students in the [[Juris Doctor]] program and a 6-to-1 student to faculty ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe Lexington Law School, the precursor to W&L Law, was founded in 1849 by [[United States federal judge]] [[John White Brockenbrough]] and is the [[Law school in the United States#Oldest active law schools|16th oldest active law school]] in the United States and the third-oldest in Virginia. The Law School was not integrated into Washington and Lee University (then known as Washington College) until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when [[Robert E. Lee]] was [[List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University|president]] of the university. In 1866, General Lee annexed the school, known at the time as the School of Law and Equity, to the college and appointed Judge Brockenbrough as the first dean. In 1870, after Lee's death, the School of Law and Equity was renamed as the Washington and Lee University School of Law, in line with the college's name change in honor of General Lee. Also in 1870, former Virginia Attorney General [[John Randolph Tucker (1823\u20131897)|John Randolph Tucker]] was appointed to the faculty and later became Dean followed by his son [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.]] In 1900, the law school moved into the newly built Tucker Hall in memory of Dean Tucker. Tucker Hall also housed the law school's first law library\u2014the Vincent L. Bradford Law Library. After significant periods of growth, the law school moved into new Tucker Hall after the original building was destroyed in a fire and the law library was rebuilt with a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]. In 1920, W&L Law joined the [[Association of American Law Schools]]. The ''[[Washington and Lee Law Review]]'' began publication in the Autumn of 1939 and is still in regular publication. After [[World War II]], enrollment increased despite a period of low enrollment during the war. In 1950, the School of Law established its chapter of the [[Order of the Coif]], one of only 80 such chapters in the country. The School of Law admitted its first female students in 1972, and opened its current home, Sydney Lewis Hall, in 1977. In 1992, the [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing]] was added to Sydney Lewis Hall and the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library at a dedication ceremony attended by Justice Powell and presided over by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]. In 2008, Dean [[Rodney Smolla]] announced the new third-year program, which became compulsory for W&L Law students in 2011 under Interim Dean Mark Grunewald. This new program turned the entire third year into an experiential curriculum which emphasizes practice, professionalism, and service. [[Nora Demleitner]] served as Dean from 2012 through 2015, the only woman to hold the position, during which time the school completed its $35 million campaign, ''Honor Our Past, Build Our Future'',<ref>{{cite web|title=A Successful Conclusion to the Capital Campaign |url=http://alumni.blogs.wlu.edu/a-successful-conclusion-to-the-capital-campaign/|publisher=law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> renovated Lewis Hall, established the Washington, DC portion of W&L's third-year program,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law2.wlu.edu/externships/page.asp?pageid=1684|title=DC Program : Externship Program |website=wlu.edu |accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> and significantly increased the employment<ref>{{cite web|title=W&L Law Releases New Employment Report |url=http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2015/04/14/wl-law-releases-new-employment-report/|publisher=law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> and bar passage<ref>{{cite web|title=http://barexam.virginia.gov/bar/barresults.html}}</ref> rates of its graduates.

As part of its recently completed $35 million campaign, ''Honor Our Past, Build Our Future'', the School of Law began an $8 million renovation and modernization project in the summer of 2014 and completed in the summer of 2015. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2014/06/23/wl-law-building-renovation-to-commence-summer-2014/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=http://law.wlu.edu/deptimages/law%20news/LawNewsVol41No3.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=http://bcwh.com/work/washington-lee-law-library/}}</ref>\n\nLewis Hall's cornerstones are the Wilbur C.

This small section consists of approximately 20 students. 1Ls are also assigned to an upper-level student from the Burks Scholar Program who teaches [[legal research]] and [[Bluebook]] methods.\n\n;Second-year\n\nIn the 2L year, students focus on advanced coursework. W&L requires [[evidence law]] and [[United States Constitution|constitutional law]] in the second-year as well as the completion of an upper-level writing requirement. The writing requirement can be satisfied through a seminar course, through an independent writing project, or a note in one of the law journals. All other courses in the 2L year are electives and commonly include [[corporate law]] and [[Taxation in the United States|tax law]] as well as many other classes and seminars. Since establishing the practice-based curriculum, W&L incorporated its experiential curricular offerings, such as practicum courses, into the second-year in addition to casebook-oriented electives.\n\n;Third-year\n\nThe new third-year program, which began in the fall of 2010, replaced further elective advanced coursework based on the casebook method as is the norm in most [[American Bar Association|ABA]] law schools. Instead, the program is meant to  simulate client experiences. The 3L year requires students to exercise professional judgment, work in teams, solve problems, counsel clients, negotiate solutions, serve as advocates and counselors \u2014 the full complement of professional activity that engages practicing lawyers as they apply legal theory and doctrines to the real-world issues of serving clients ethically and honorably within the highest traditions of the profession.\n\nThe Fall semester begins with an immersion course. Students are allowed to choose one of two courses for the two-week immersion. Immersion focuses on either [[litigation]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]] or transactional practice. Each student is then enrolled in practicum courses of their choosing. These courses cover substantive and advanced law but do so through practical methods of drafting paperwork and problem-solving rather than casebook and the [[socratic method]]. Students are also required to take a course in the [[legal profession]] as well as a law-related service requirement. Finally, each student is required to be involved in one of W&L's legal clinics, externship programs, or transnational programs to gain real-client experience. The program is flexible and allows students the ability to tailor their schedule and, if they wish, to take several traditional casebook method courses.\n\n==The Honor System==\nThe [[Honor system|Honor System]] has been run by the student body since 1905 and is derived from Robert E. Lee during his tenure as [[List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University|President]] of the University. Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation by his or her peers is subject to a single penalty: expulsion. The Honor System is defined and administered solely by students, and there is no higher review. A formal review, occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to refine the tenets of the Honor System. Students continue to support the Honor System and its single penalty overwhelmingly, and alumni regularly point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&L experience. W&L Law students enjoy several distinct benefits from the Honor System. These include more freedom in exam taking as well as an informal account system at the Brief Stop cafeteria in Sydney Lewis Hall. These are balanced by the strict penalty of a violation of the Honor System.\n\nStudents pledge the following prior to turning in assignments and exams:\n\n\"On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unacknowledged aid on this (exam, test, paper, etc.).\"\n\n==Clinics, journals, moot court, and centers==\n[[File:W&LLawLib.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Wilbur C.

Facilities are on the historic campus of [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Sydney Lewis|Sydney Lewis Hall]]. W&L Law has a total enrollment of approximately 365 students in the [[Juris Doctor]] program and a 6-to-1 student to faculty ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe Lexington Law School, the precursor to W&L Law, was founded in 1849 by [[United States federal judge]] [[John White Brockenbrough]] and is the [[Law school in the United States#Oldest active law schools|16th oldest active law school]] in the United States and the third-oldest in Virginia. The Law School was not integrated into Washington and Lee University (then known as Washington College) until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when [[Robert E. Lee]] was [[List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University|president]] of the university. In 1866, General Lee annexed the school, known at the time as the School of Law and Equity, to the college and appointed Judge Brockenbrough as the first dean. In 1870, after Lee's death, the School of Law and Equity was renamed as the Washington and Lee University School of Law, in line with the college's name change in honor of General Lee. Also in 1870, former Virginia Attorney General [[John Randolph Tucker (1823\u20131897)|John Randolph Tucker]] was appointed to the faculty and later became Dean followed by his son [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.]] In 1900, the law school moved into the newly built Tucker Hall in memory of Dean Tucker. Tucker Hall also housed the law school's first law library\u2014the Vincent L. Bradford Law Library. After significant periods of growth, the law school moved into new Tucker Hall after the original building was destroyed in a fire and the law library was rebuilt with a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]. In 1920, W&L Law joined the [[Association of American Law Schools]]. The ''[[Washington and Lee Law Review]]'' began publication in the Autumn of 1939 and is still in regular publication. After [[World War II]], enrollment increased despite a period of low enrollment during the war. In 1950, the School of Law established its chapter of the [[Order of the Coif]], one of only 80 such chapters in the country. The School of Law admitted its first female students in 1972, and opened its current home, Sydney Lewis Hall, in 1977. In 1992, the [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing]] was added to Sydney Lewis Hall and the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library at a dedication ceremony attended by Justice Powell and presided over by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]. In 2008, Dean [[Rodney Smolla]] announced the new third-year program, which became compulsory for W&L Law students in 2011 under Interim Dean Mark Grunewald. This new program turned the entire third year into an experiential curriculum which emphasizes practice, professionalism, and service. [[Nora Demleitner]] served as Dean from 2012 through 2015, the only woman to hold the position, during which time the school completed its $35 million campaign, ''Honor Our Past, Build Our Future'',<ref>{{cite web|title=A Successful Conclusion to the Capital Campaign |url=http://alumni.blogs.wlu.edu/a-successful-conclusion-to-the-capital-campaign/|publisher=law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> renovated Lewis Hall, established the Washington, DC portion of W&L's third-year program,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law2.wlu.edu/externships/page.asp?pageid=1684|title=DC Program : Externship Program |website=wlu.edu |accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> and significantly increased the employment<ref>{{cite web|title=W&L Law Releases New Employment Report |url=http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2015/04/14/wl-law-releases-new-employment-report/|publisher=law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> and bar passage<ref>{{cite web|title=http://barexam.virginia.gov/bar/barresults.html}}</ref> rates of its graduates.

As part of its recently completed $35 million campaign, ''Honor Our Past, Build Our Future'', the School of Law began an $8 million renovation and modernization project in the summer of 2014 and completed in the summer of 2015. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2014/06/23/wl-law-building-renovation-to-commence-summer-2014/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=http://law.wlu.edu/deptimages/law%20news/LawNewsVol41No3.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=http://bcwh.com/work/washington-lee-law-library/}}</ref>\n\nLewis Hall's cornerstones are the Wilbur C.

Additionally, each student is assigned a small section in which one substantive required course also serves as a [[legal writing]] course. This small section consists of approximately 20 students. 1Ls are also assigned to an upper-level student from the Burks Scholar Program who teaches [[legal research]] and [[Bluebook]] methods.\n\n;Second-year\n\nIn the 2L year, students focus on advanced coursework. W&L requires [[evidence law]] and [[United States Constitution|constitutional law]] in the second-year as well as the completion of an upper-level writing requirement. The writing requirement can be satisfied through a seminar course, through an independent writing project, or a note in one of the law journals. All other courses in the 2L year are electives and commonly include [[corporate law]] and [[Taxation in the United States|tax law]] as well as many other classes and seminars. Since establishing the practice-based curriculum, W&L incorporated its experiential curricular offerings, such as practicum courses, into the second-year in addition to casebook-oriented electives.\n\n;Third-year\n\nThe new third-year program, which began in the fall of 2010, replaced further elective advanced coursework based on the casebook method as is the norm in most [[American Bar Association|ABA]] law schools. Instead, the program is meant to  simulate client experiences. The 3L year requires students to exercise professional judgment, work in teams, solve problems, counsel clients, negotiate solutions, serve as advocates and counselors \u2014 the full complement of professional activity that engages practicing lawyers as they apply legal theory and doctrines to the real-world issues of serving clients ethically and honorably within the highest traditions of the profession.\n\nThe Fall semester begins with an immersion course. Students are allowed to choose one of two courses for the two-week immersion. Immersion focuses on either [[litigation]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]] or transactional practice. Each student is then enrolled in practicum courses of their choosing. These courses cover substantive and advanced law but do so through practical methods of drafting paperwork and problem-solving rather than casebook and the [[socratic method]]. Students are also required to take a course in the [[legal profession]] as well as a law-related service requirement. Finally, each student is required to be involved in one of W&L's legal clinics, externship programs, or transnational programs to gain real-client experience. The program is flexible and allows students the ability to tailor their schedule and, if they wish, to take several traditional casebook method courses.\n\n==The Honor System==\nThe [[Honor system|Honor System]] has been run by the student body since 1905 and is derived from Robert E. Lee during his tenure as [[List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University|President]] of the University. Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation by his or her peers is subject to a single penalty: expulsion. The Honor System is defined and administered solely by students, and there is no higher review. A formal review, occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to refine the tenets of the Honor System. Students continue to support the Honor System and its single penalty overwhelmingly, and alumni regularly point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&L experience. W&L Law students enjoy several distinct benefits from the Honor System. These include more freedom in exam taking as well as an informal account system at the Brief Stop cafeteria in Sydney Lewis Hall. These are balanced by the strict penalty of a violation of the Honor System.\n\nStudents pledge the following prior to turning in assignments and exams:\n\n\"On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unacknowledged aid on this (exam, test, paper, etc.).\"\n\n==Clinics, journals, moot court, and centers==\n[[File:W&LLawLib.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Wilbur C.

JD students are required to take 86 semester hours of credit in order to graduate. In the first year of law school all students are required to take one semester each of Contracts, Property, Torts, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Criminal Law.  Additionally, in fall of their first year all students are required to take  Legal Practice I and Legal Research Methodologies I, and in spring of their first year students are required to take Legal Practice II and Legal Research Methodologies II. For the entering class of 2016\u20132017 all first-year students took Civil Procedure in the spring; the rest of the first-year doctrinal courses were offered in both fall and spring. It remains to be seen if that scheduling practice will continue in the future. The second and third year offer more flexibility in planning the student's curriculum as there are only two mandatory classes (a class from the ethics curriculum and one seminar). In addition to their substantive coursework, many second and third-year students participate in moot court, a scholarly publication, a clinic, or an externship.\n\n===Joint Degree programs===\nFor students interested in a more general interdisciplinary course of study, the School of Law offers five joint degree programs (usually completed in four years, as opposed to three for a standard JD):\n:JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], with Washington University's [[Olin Business School]]\n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in East Asian Studies, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]] \n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Economics, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]]\n:JD-[[Master of Health Administration|MHA]] in Health Administration, with the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]\n:JD-[[Master of Social Work|MSW]], with Washington University's [[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]\n:JD-[[Master of Laws|LL.M]], with [[University of Queensland]]\n\n===[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program===\nWashington University School of Law offers an LL.M. in U.S. Law for International Students, an LL.M. in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution, an LL.M. in Intellectual Property & Technology Law, and an LL.M. in Taxation.

In addition to law office practice, the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic includes an in-house component in which students observe and conduct mediations, assist in at least one legislative drafting experience, and participate in at least one civil rights community education project of the student's choosing.  The Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic became involved in larger scale community lawyering by assisting on the lawsuit opposing the anti-immigrant ordinances in [[Valley Park, Missouri]].\n\n===Criminal Justice===\nThe Criminal Justice Clinic operates in collaboration with the St. Louis County office of the Missouri State Public Defender System, located approximately one mile from the law school in the St. Louis County Justice Center.

Clinic students in the Criminal Division participate in criminal investigations and prosecution (from initial fact investigations to final appellate work).\n\n===Interdisciplinary Environmental===\nThis Clinic consists of both \"student attorneys\" (second and third year law students) and \"student consultants\" (graduate and upper-level undergraduates students of Washington University studying engineering, environmental studies, medicine, social work and/or business), work in interdisciplinary teams under faculty supervision. These teams offer legal and technical assistance on environmental and community health problems to individuals and organizations that cannot afford to pay for such services. Clinic teams work on issues relating to air and water quality, lead poisoning, environmental justice, habitat destruction and wetlands.<ref>http://law.wustl.edu/intenv/</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, the Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic helped reach a milestone agreement between [[Sierra Club]] and [[Kansas City Power & Light]] (\"KCPL\").  This agreement requires KCPL to make the most significant carbon reduction commitments of any utility in the Midwest.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Utility and Sierra Club Deal Aims to Cut Carbon Dioxide|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/business/20energy.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-03-20|access-date = 2015-06-07|issn = 0362-4331|first = Matthew L.|last = Wald}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Electric Utility, Sierra Club End Dispute|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/19/AR2007031901606.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2007-03-20|access-date = 2015-06-07|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Steven|last = Mufson}}</ref> {{failed verification|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Intellectual Property and Nonprofit Organizations===\nStudents in this Clinic collaborate with students from the School of Medicine, Olin School of Business, the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the George Warren Brown School of Social Work, and Arts & Sciences; and to provide [[intellectual property]] and business formation legal services to clients who might otherwise not have access to competent legal counsel.\nIt works with St. Louis-area IP attorneys to provide early stage legal advice to other innovators and entrepreneurs, especially with business incubators in the St. Louis area; work with nonprofit organizations such as: St. Louis Volunteer Lawyers and Accountants for the Arts (VLAA), and Public Interest Intellectual Property Advisors (PIIPA).\n\n===Judicial Clerkship===\nThe Judicial Clerkship externship exposes students to civil and criminal litigation from the judicial perspective. Students work as part-time law clerks under the supervision of local, state or federal trial or appellate judges. Students participating in the  externship course observe hearings, trials and other court proceedings; perform legal research; and draft a series of legal memoranda relevant to cases under submission by the courts.\n\n==Student publications==\n\nThe Washington University School of Law has four student-run publications.  After the completion of their first year, students are encouraged to participate in a \"write-on\" competition.  This competition has generally entailed writing a case comment.  Based upon the quality of a student's case comment, a student may be invited to join the publication of their choice.<br />  Second-year students participating in one of the three Washington University School of Law student-run publications are considered \"associate\" or \"staff\" editors.  In addition to their editing responsibilities (which generally consist of \"shelf-checks\"), these students are required to write a \"note.\"  Based upon the quality of their writing, students may be asked to publish their note in the publication in which they belong.  Rising third-year law students are encouraged to apply for an editorial position within their publication.  These board positions range from lower-level editing positions to the editor-in-chief position.\n\n* ''[[Washington University Law Review]]'' began as the ''St. Louis Law Review'' in 1915 and was re-titled the ''Washington University Law Quarterly'' in 1936. The ''Law Review'' is a student-run academic journal that publishes six issues per year.  The staff selects and edits articles from legal scholars, practitioners, and students, and welcomes submissions on any legal topic. In addition to the printed publications, ''Law Review'' maintains an online supplement entitled Slip Opinions featuring original commentary and debate by members of the legal academy, bench, and bar.\n* '''''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''''' originated in 1968 as the ''Urban Law Annual'' and focused entirely on issues surrounding [[land use]], [[urban development]], and other legal concerns of urban communities. The scope broadened in 1983 when the ''Journal'' expanded (and became the ''Journal of Urban and Contemporary Law'') to encompass a broad range of topics. In 1999, the ''Journal'' once again broadened its scope to become the ''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''. The ''Journal'' generates a [[symposium]]-based publication that brings together communities of scholars, to emphasize existing and emerging visions of the law in relation to interdisciplinary and [[multicultural]] perspectives, the implications of [[technology]], and the consequences of [[economic globalization]] for the purpose of influencing law and social policy. Each year, the Journal publishes an \"Access to Justice\" volume. This volume is a compilation of essays from the Washington University School of Law\u2019s \"Access to Justice\" speaker series, one goal of which is to encourage and challenge audiences to use their legal education for the ultimate betterment of our society. Additionally, the Journal collaborates with faculty members to publish symposia along a broad spectrum of contemporary topics.\n* '''''Washington University Global Studies Law Review''''' is a student-edited international legal journal dedicated to publishing articles by international, foreign, and [[comparative law]] scholars. ''Global'' publishes quarterly. ''Global's'' publications present articles, book reviews, essays, and notes from academics, practitioners, and students, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Washington University Global Studies Law Review {{!}} Law School {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|url = http://law.wustl.edu/wugslr/index.asp?ID=3837|website = law.WUStL.edu|access-date = June 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Global'' occasionally publishes articles in conjunction with symposia from the [[Whitney Robson Harris|Whitney R.

The purpose of the Review is to promote academic discussion and scholarship at the nexus between law and philosophy.  It also seeks to broaden and deepen the law school experience by fostering critical analysis of the suppositions and theories that underlie the law school curriculum.  To further these purposes, the Review publishes scholar- and practitioner-authored articles, as well as  student-authored notes.\n\n==Student organizations==\nThe Washington University School of Law has an always evolving variety of student organizations.  A majority of these organizations represent a local chapter of a larger national organization. In addition to the organizations which represent as national chapter, Washington University School of Law has several student organizations that are unique to the Law School; \n* American Constitution Society (ACS)\n* American Indian Law Students Association (AILSA)\n* Barely Legal Theater (a student-run organization where students write and perform skits or songs that poke fun at law school life)\n* The Federalist Society \n* Sidebar Wine Society\n* Graduate-Professional Council (selected students represent the school of law in University matters)\n* Honor Council (charged with enforcing the Honor Code)\n* Illinois Student Bar Association (ISBA)\n* Intellectual Property Law Society (IPLS)\n* Joint Degree Law Society (for students who are pursuing more than one graduate degree)\n* OUTLaw (for LGBTQ* students and allies)\n* Second Career Law Students (SCaLeS)\n* Wash U Out West (WOW)\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:WashUABhall.jpg|thumb|Anheuser Busch Hall]]\nIn January 1997, Washington University School of Law moved into Anheuser-Busch Hall. Anheuser-Busch Hall architecturally mirrors the classic style of the Washington University [[Danforth Campus]]. Anheuser-Busch Hall includes two fully functional courtrooms; numerous classrooms; and an open-stacks Law Library. Additionally, AB Hall includes common areas, such as the W.L. Hadley Griffin Student Commons and the glass-domed Crowder Courtyard.  In AB Hall all classrooms, seminar rooms, and breakout rooms have both computing and multimedia capabilities. Each classroom and seminar room is also equipped with a multimedia projection system. This allows instructors to video-tape classes and post the lectures online.\n\nConstruction of a new Social Sciences and Law Building has been finished.  The new building is situated just southwest of Anheuser-Busch Hall. Ground was broken for the four-story, [[Collegiate Gothic]] building on September 5, 2006; the targeted date for completion was June 30, 2008.  About {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} of the new building\u2019s 142,000 net square feet were earmarked for the law school, housing some administrative offices, law journal offices, and classrooms.\n\n== Employment ==\nAccording to WashU Law's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 87.1% of 2018 graduates had secured full-time, long-term, JD-required employment within nine months of graduation.

JD students are required to take 86 semester hours of credit in order to graduate. In the first year of law school all students are required to take one semester each of Contracts, Property, Torts, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Criminal Law.  Additionally, in fall of their first year all students are required to take  Legal Practice I and Legal Research Methodologies I, and in spring of their first year students are required to take Legal Practice II and Legal Research Methodologies II. For the entering class of 2016\u20132017 all first-year students took Civil Procedure in the spring; the rest of the first-year doctrinal courses were offered in both fall and spring. It remains to be seen if that scheduling practice will continue in the future. The second and third year offer more flexibility in planning the student's curriculum as there are only two mandatory classes (a class from the ethics curriculum and one seminar). In addition to their substantive coursework, many second and third-year students participate in moot court, a scholarly publication, a clinic, or an externship.\n\n===Joint Degree programs===\nFor students interested in a more general interdisciplinary course of study, the School of Law offers five joint degree programs (usually completed in four years, as opposed to three for a standard JD):\n:JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], with Washington University's [[Olin Business School]]\n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in East Asian Studies, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]] \n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Economics, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]]\n:JD-[[Master of Health Administration|MHA]] in Health Administration, with the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]\n:JD-[[Master of Social Work|MSW]], with Washington University's [[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]\n:JD-[[Master of Laws|LL.M]], with [[University of Queensland]]\n\n===[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program===\nWashington University School of Law offers an LL.M. in U.S. Law for International Students, an LL.M. in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution, an LL.M. in Intellectual Property & Technology Law, and an LL.M. in Taxation.

After the clerk of the court assigns cases at the beginning of the semester, students handle all aspects of the appeal, including motions, filings, and briefs. The representation typically provides at least one student each semester an opportunity to argue a case before a panel of the Eighth Circuit.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Civil Justice===\nThe Civil Justice Clinic requires students to handle their own case load under the supervision of the faculty.  In utilizing the student body for representation, the Civil Justice Clinic assists in the provision of legal services to needy members of the community and imparts the obligation for public service. The Clinic also includes a weekly seminar.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Civil Rights and Community Justice===\nIn the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic, students work in the fields of immigration and employment discrimination.  Students are placed at Legal Aid, selected non-profits, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], and in selected plaintiff law firms to assist on [[immigration]] status and immigrants rights cases as well as cases of alleged [[discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], national origin, [[sex]], age, and disability in employment, education, and other arenas. Students engage in interviewing, counseling, case analysis and planning, problem solving, fact investigation, document drafting, negotiation, mediation, and community education. In addition to law office practice, the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic includes an in-house component in which students observe and conduct mediations, assist in at least one legislative drafting experience, and participate in at least one civil rights community education project of the student's choosing.  The Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic became involved in larger scale community lawyering by assisting on the lawsuit opposing the anti-immigrant ordinances in [[Valley Park, Missouri]].\n\n===Criminal Justice===\nThe Criminal Justice Clinic operates in collaboration with the St. Louis County office of the Missouri State Public Defender System, located approximately one mile from the law school in the St. Louis County Justice Center. The Criminal Justice Clinic exposes students to real life lawyering skills within the framework of the state level criminal justice system. Clinic students have the opportunity to serve as Rule 13 certified legal interns, and perform the work of a lawyer, representing clients facing criminal charges.\n\n===Congressional and Administrative Law===\nIn this clinic, approximately 24 third-year law students spend their spring semester in [[Washington D.C.]] and work under the direction of attorneys in a variety of government offices.  Examples include the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], the Civil Rights Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], the Corporate Finance Section of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nAs prerequisite to taking this course, students participating in the Congressional and Administrative Law Clinic are required to enroll a course on [[ethics]] in government in addition to their daily work at the [[internship]]. \n\n===Government Lawyering===\nThe Government Lawyering Clinic provides the opportunity for students to work with attorneys in the Criminal or Civil Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.<br />Students in this Clinic work in the Eastern District of Missouri office in St. Louis or the Southern District of [[Illinois]] office in [[East St. Louis]].   Clinic students in the Criminal Division participate in criminal investigations and prosecution (from initial fact investigations to final appellate work).\n\n===Interdisciplinary Environmental===\nThis Clinic consists of both \"student attorneys\" (second and third year law students) and \"student consultants\" (graduate and upper-level undergraduates students of Washington University studying engineering, environmental studies, medicine, social work and/or business), work in interdisciplinary teams under faculty supervision. These teams offer legal and technical assistance on environmental and community health problems to individuals and organizations that cannot afford to pay for such services. Clinic teams work on issues relating to air and water quality, lead poisoning, environmental justice, habitat destruction and wetlands.<ref>http://law.wustl.edu/intenv/</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, the Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic helped reach a milestone agreement between [[Sierra Club]] and [[Kansas City Power & Light]] (\"KCPL\").

Students work as part-time law clerks under the supervision of local, state or federal trial or appellate judges. Students participating in the  externship course observe hearings, trials and other court proceedings; perform legal research; and draft a series of legal memoranda relevant to cases under submission by the courts.\n\n==Student publications==\n\nThe Washington University School of Law has four student-run publications.  After the completion of their first year, students are encouraged to participate in a \"write-on\" competition.  This competition has generally entailed writing a case comment.  Based upon the quality of a student's case comment, a student may be invited to join the publication of their choice.<br />  Second-year students participating in one of the three Washington University School of Law student-run publications are considered \"associate\" or \"staff\" editors.  In addition to their editing responsibilities (which generally consist of \"shelf-checks\"), these students are required to write a \"note.\"  Based upon the quality of their writing, students may be asked to publish their note in the publication in which they belong.  Rising third-year law students are encouraged to apply for an editorial position within their publication.  These board positions range from lower-level editing positions to the editor-in-chief position.  \n\n* ''[[Washington University Law Review]]'' began as the ''St. Louis Law Review'' in 1915 and was re-titled the ''Washington University Law Quarterly'' in 1936. The ''Law Review'' is a student-run academic journal that publishes six issues per year.  The staff selects and edits articles from legal scholars, practitioners, and students, and welcomes submissions on any legal topic. In addition to the printed publications, ''Law Review'' maintains an online supplement entitled Slip Opinions featuring original commentary and debate by members of the legal academy, bench, and bar.\n\n* '''''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''''' originated in 1968 as the ''Urban Law Annual'' and focused entirely on issues surrounding [[land use]], [[urban development]], and other legal concerns of urban communities. The scope broadened in 1983 when the ''Journal'' expanded (and became the ''Journal of Urban and Contemporary Law'') to encompass a broad range of topics. In 1999, the ''Journal'' once again broadened its scope to become the ''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''. The ''Journal'' generates a [[symposium]]-based publication that brings together communities of scholars, to emphasize existing and emerging visions of the law in relation to interdisciplinary and [[multicultural]] perspectives, the implications of [[technology]], and the consequences of [[economic globalization]] for the purpose of influencing law and social policy. Each year, the Journal publishes an \"Access to Justice\" volume. This volume is a compilation of essays from the Washington University School of Law\u2019s \"Access to Justice\" speaker series, one goal of which is to encourage and challenge audiences to use their legal education for the ultimate betterment of our society. Additionally, the Journal collaborates with faculty members to publish symposia along a broad spectrum of contemporary topics.\n\n* '''''Washington University Global Studies Law Review''''' is a student-edited international legal journal dedicated to publishing articles by international, foreign, and [[comparative law]] scholars. ''Global'' publishes quarterly. ''Global's'' publications present articles, book reviews, essays, and notes from academics, practitioners, and students, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Washington University Global Studies Law Review {{!}} Law School {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|url = http://law.wustl.edu/wugslr/index.asp?ID=3837|website = law.WUStL.edu|access-date = June 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Global'' occasionally publishes articles in conjunction with symposia from the [[Whitney Robson Harris|Whitney R.

The purpose of the Review is to promote academic discussion and scholarship at the nexus between law and philosophy.  It also seeks to broaden and deepen the law school experience by fostering critical analysis of the suppositions and theories that underlie the law school curriculum.  To further these purposes, the Review publishes scholar- and practitioner-authored articles, as well as  student-authored notes.\n\n==Student organizations==\nThe Washington University School of Law has an always evolving variety of student organizations.
