Colchester is generally regarded as having an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester's weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20\u00b0Cs/low 30\u00b0Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and [[thunderstorm]]s can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Colchester was {{convert|36.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2003 (during the [[2003 European heat wave]]), and the lowest was {{convert|-9.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December 2010.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colchester\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 7\n|Feb high C = 7.7\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.2\n|May high C = 18\n|Jun high C = 20.6\n|Jul high C = 23.4\n|Aug high C = 23.3\n|Sep high C = 19.9\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 10.3\n|Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 7.1\n|Apr mean C = 10.9\n|May mean C = 12.8\n|Jun mean C = 15.6\n|Jul mean C = 18.3\n|Aug mean C = 18.1\n|Sep mean C = 15.4\n|Oct mean C = 11.5\n|Nov mean C = 7.5\n|Dec mean C = 5\n|Year mean C =\n|Jan low C = 2\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.3\n|Apr low C = 4.7\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.2\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 10.9\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 4.8\n|Dec low C = 2.7\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 53\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 44\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44\n|May precipitation mm = 52\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54\n|Jul precipitation mm = 48\n|Aug precipitation mm = 57\n|Sep precipitation mm = 52\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70\n|Nov precipitation mm = 62\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = 1981\u20132010 estimated average (records began in 1988) for COL station Colchester NE 2\n}}\n\n==Garrison {{anchor|MCTC}}==\n{{Main|Colchester Garrison}}\n\n[[File:MCTC Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 63934.jpg|thumb|right|The military corrective training centre]]Colchester has been an important military garrison since the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] era.

Two of the town's secondary schools are selective, [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]] and [[Colchester County High School]], the remainder being comprehensives. Comprehensive secondary schools include [[Gilberd School]], [[Colchester Academy]], [[Philip Morant School and College]], [[St Helena School, Essex|St Helena Media Arts College]], [[St Benedict's Catholic College]], [[Thomas Lord Audley School]] and the Paxman Academy.\n\n===Tertiary===\nThe [[University of Essex]] is located to the east of Colchester in Wivenhoe Park, in the civil parish of [[Wivenhoe]]. Other tertiary institutions include [[Colchester Sixth Form College]] and [[Colchester Institute]].\n\n====Private schools====\nPrivate schools in Colchester include [[St. Mary's Colchester|St. Mary's School]], and [[Colchester High School]].\n\n==Transport==\nColchester has a bus system (run mostly by [[First Essex]] and [[Arriva Colchester]], as well as [[Hedingham Omnibuses]], Beeston's, [[Ipswich Buses]], Panther Travel (Essex) and [[Chambers (bus company)|Chambers]]) which mostly uses the bus station in Osborne Street on the southern edge of the town centre.\n\n[[Colchester railway station]] is located on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The town is also served by [[Colchester Town railway station]] and [[Hythe (Essex) railway station|Hythe station]] located on the [[Sunshine Coast Line]].\n\nColchester is linked to London by the [[A12 road (England)|A12]].\n\n==References in literature==\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]] mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in ''The Annals of Imperial Rome''. In Book XIV he describes how '...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum', later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV, 31</ref>\n\nIt is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as being the target of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. The (fictional) Atomic Wars took place during the 1950s. Colchester is the only town that was specifically mentioned as being bombed, but the book does say that many cities were destroyed in North America, Europe, and Russia.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date=February 2019}} \nColchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: '[[Old King Cole]]', '[[Humpty Dumpty]]' and 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star', although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nLocal legend places Colchester as the seat of [[King Cole]] (or Coel) of the rhyme ''Old King Cole'', a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from [[Latin]]: the place-name suffixes ''chester'', ''cester'', and ''caster'' derive from the Latin word ''[[castrum]]'' (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole's Castle {{who|date=August 2017}}, though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[senator]] [[Constantius Chlorus]], who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole's successor. Helena's son became Emperor [[Constantine I]]. Helena was canonised as [[Saint]] [[Helena of Constantinople]] and is credited with finding the [[true cross]] and the remains of [[biblical magi|the Magi]]. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor's medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school&nbsp;\u2013 St Helena's&nbsp;\u2013 is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.\n\nColchester is a widely credited source{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} of the rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]]. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (''Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall'') and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, ''Humpty Dumpty'' being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'') and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (''all the king's horses and all the king's men / couldn't put Humpty together again.'') Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.\n\nThe third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]], which was written by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]]  who lived in the town's Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title \"The Star\".\n\nColchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of [[Camelot]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=Early British Kingdoms: Colchester|url=http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211112608/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|archivedate=11 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of ''Camulodunum'': this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.\n\nThe first part of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' was set in Colchester.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nColchester was also a named line of [[lathe]] machinery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |title=As detailed here |publisher=Lathes.co.uk |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102004031/http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe opening credits for the British TV comedy show [[Blackadder Goes Forth]] and a scene from the film [[Monty Python and the Meaning of Life]] were both filmed at [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester's former cavalry barracks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] Colchester was the scene of a nuclear detonation.\n\nThe ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes ''[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]'' are set in Colchester, although they were filmed in [[Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Wales |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |title=IGN review |publisher=ign.com |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617223502/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Asterix]] comic book ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'' the [[Camulodunum]] rugby team wins a game against [[Durovernum]] (Roman name for [[Canterbury]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goscinny|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=Underzo|first2=Albert|title=Asterix in Britain|series=Asterix #3|year=1973|publisher=Hodder Dargaud|isbn=0-340-17221-5|page=38}}</ref> The uniforms worn during the match in the book are similar to the modern kit of [[Colchester United]].\n\nProminent members of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], a popular 1990s music group met at school in Colchester.<ref>{{cite news|title=Colchester: how a shared 'fly pie' may bring Britpop band Blur back to Colchester|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|newspaper=Daily Gazette|date=22 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110935/http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Princesses on Parade\" sequence in the 1994 film ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', one of the princesses in the beauty pageant is said to come from Colchester.

Colchester is generally regarded as having an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester's weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20\u00b0Cs/low 30\u00b0Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and [[thunderstorm]]s can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Colchester was {{convert|36.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2003 (during the [[2003 European heat wave]]), and the lowest was {{convert|-9.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in December 2010.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colchester\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 7\n|Feb high C = 7.7\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.2\n|May high C = 18\n|Jun high C = 20.6\n|Jul high C = 23.4\n|Aug high C = 23.3\n|Sep high C = 19.9\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 10.3\n|Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 7.1\n|Apr mean C = 10.9\n|May mean C = 12.8\n|Jun mean C = 15.6\n|Jul mean C = 18.3\n|Aug mean C = 18.1\n|Sep mean C = 15.4\n|Oct mean C = 11.5\n|Nov mean C = 7.5\n|Dec mean C = 5\n|Year mean C =\n|Jan low C = 2\n|Feb low C = 1.7\n|Mar low C = 3.3\n|Apr low C = 4.7\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.2\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 10.9\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 4.8\n|Dec low C = 2.7\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 53\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 44\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44\n|May precipitation mm = 52\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54\n|Jul precipitation mm = 48\n|Aug precipitation mm = 57\n|Sep precipitation mm = 52\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70\n|Nov precipitation mm = 62\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = 1981\u20132010 estimated average (records began in 1988) for COL station Colchester NE 2\n}}\n\n==Garrison {{anchor|MCTC}}==\n{{Main|Colchester Garrison}}\n\n[[File:MCTC Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 63934.jpg|thumb|right|The military corrective training centre]]Colchester has been an important military garrison since the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] era.

Two of the town's secondary schools are selective, [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]] and [[Colchester County High School]], the remainder being comprehensives. Comprehensive secondary schools include [[Gilberd School]], [[Colchester Academy]], [[Philip Morant School and College]], [[St Helena School, Essex|St Helena Media Arts College]], [[St Benedict's Catholic College]], [[Thomas Lord Audley School]] and the Paxman Academy.\n\n===Tertiary===\nThe [[University of Essex]] is located to the east of Colchester in Wivenhoe Park, in the civil parish of [[Wivenhoe]]. Other tertiary institutions include [[Colchester Sixth Form College]] and [[Colchester Institute]].\n\n====Private schools====\nPrivate schools in Colchester include [[St. Mary's Colchester|St. Mary's School]], and [[Colchester High School]].\n\n==Transport==\nColchester has a bus system (run mostly by [[First Essex]] and [[Arriva Colchester]], as well as [[Hedingham Omnibuses]], Beeston's, [[Ipswich Buses]], Panther Travel (Essex) and [[Chambers (bus company)|Chambers]]) which mostly uses the bus station in Osborne Street on the southern edge of the town centre.\n\n[[Colchester railway station]] is located on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The town is also served by [[Colchester Town railway station]] and [[Hythe (Essex) railway station|Hythe station]] located on the [[Sunshine Coast Line]].\n\nColchester is linked to London by the [[A12 road (England)|A12]].\n\n==References in literature==\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]] mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in ''The Annals of Imperial Rome''. In Book XIV he describes how '...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum', later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV, 31</ref>\n\nIt is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as being the target of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. The (fictional) Atomic Wars took place during the 1950s. Colchester is the only town that was specifically mentioned as being bombed, but the book does say that many cities were destroyed in North America, Europe, and Russia.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date=February 2019}} \nColchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: '[[Old King Cole]]', '[[Humpty Dumpty]]' and 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star', although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nLocal legend places Colchester as the seat of [[King Cole]] (or Coel) of the rhyme ''Old King Cole'', a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from [[Latin]]: the place-name suffixes ''chester'', ''cester'', and ''caster'' derive from the Latin word ''[[castrum]]'' (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole's Castle {{who|date=August 2017}}, though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[senator]] [[Constantius Chlorus]], who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole's successor. Helena's son became Emperor [[Constantine I]]. Helena was canonised as [[Saint]] [[Helena of Constantinople]] and is credited with finding the [[true cross]] and the remains of [[biblical magi|the Magi]]. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor's medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school&nbsp;\u2013 St Helena's&nbsp;\u2013 is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.\n\nColchester is a widely credited source{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} of the rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]]. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (''Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall'') and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, ''Humpty Dumpty'' being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'') and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (''all the king's horses and all the king's men / couldn't put Humpty together again.'') Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.\n\nThe third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]], which was written by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]]  who lived in the town's Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title \"The Star\".\n\nColchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of [[Camelot]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=Early British Kingdoms: Colchester|url=http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211112608/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|archivedate=11 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of ''Camulodunum'': this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.\n\nThe first part of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' was set in Colchester.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nColchester was also a named line of [[lathe]] machinery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |title=As detailed here |publisher=Lathes.co.uk |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102004031/http://www.lathes.co.uk/colchester/index.html |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe opening credits for the British TV comedy show [[Blackadder Goes Forth]] and a scene from the film [[Monty Python and the Meaning of Life]] were both filmed at [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester's former cavalry barracks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] Colchester was the scene of a nuclear detonation.\n\nThe ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes ''[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]'' are set in Colchester, although they were filmed in [[Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Wales |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |title=IGN review |publisher=ign.com |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617223502/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1096927p1.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Asterix]] comic book ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'' the [[Camulodunum]] rugby team wins a game against [[Durovernum]] (Roman name for [[Canterbury]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goscinny|first1=Ren\u00e9|last2=Underzo|first2=Albert|title=Asterix in Britain|series=Asterix #3|year=1973|publisher=Hodder Dargaud|isbn=0-340-17221-5|page=38}}</ref> The uniforms worn during the match in the book are similar to the modern kit of [[Colchester United]].\n\nProminent members of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], a popular 1990s music group met at school in Colchester.<ref>{{cite news|title=Colchester: how a shared 'fly pie' may bring Britpop band Blur back to Colchester|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|newspaper=Daily Gazette|date=22 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110935/http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/3995061.Colchester__how_a_shared__fly_pie__may_bring_Britpop_band_Blur_back_to_Colchester/|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Princesses on Parade\" sequence in the 1994 film ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', one of the princesses in the beauty pageant is said to come from Colchester.

In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>Feb. 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s. [[American Airlines]] also resumed mainline service.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated.

JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use the aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. This is said officially to improve service, but actually exists to pacify anti-airport residents who reside in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.  HPN also has programs that do not allow airplane larger than 12,500 pounds to takeoff at the runway intersections, or run-up their engines without prior approval of airport operations.\n\n==Local context==\nAfter several renovations, as well as discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=1989-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 | language = }}</ref> the airport is currently served by six scheduled passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations in the [[United States]].

Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

The project will expand the terminal by 20% and include additional check-in, screening and passenger waiting areas. The expansion will also include the addition of four new [[Jetbridges|jet bridges]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Cape Air]] | [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Provincetown Airport|Provincetown]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[JetBlue]] | [[Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]], [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]<ref>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181113005796/en/Start-Planning-Summer-JetBlue-Service-Nantucket-Year</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Rectrix Aviation|Rectrix Shuttle]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Tradewind Aviation]] |[[Logan International Airport|Boston]] <br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Morrisville\u2013Stowe State Airport|Stowe]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Tradewind Aviation adds Westchester County \u2013 Stowe service in W19 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/287008/tradewind-aviation-adds-westchester-county-stowe-service-in-w19/ |website=Routesonline |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]]\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Airline market share===\n{{Bar graph\n| title = '''Carrier Shares for May 2018 \u2013 April 2019'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=HPN&Airport_Name=White%20Plains,%20NY:%20Westchester%20County&carrier=FACTS |title=OST_R &#124; BTS &#124; Transtats |publisher=Transtats.bts.gov |date= |accessdate=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n| bar_width   = 45\n| width_units = em\n| label_type  = Carrier\n| data_type   = Passengers (arriving and departing)\n| data_max    = 778,000\n| label1   = [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]]\n| data1    = 778,000\n| comment1 = 48.52%\n| label2   = [[Endeavor Air|Endeavor]]\n| data2    = 193,000\n| comment2 = 12.04%\n| label3   = [[PSA Airlines|PSA]]\n| data3    = 193,000\n| comment3 = 12.01%\n| label4   = [[SkyWest Airlines|SkyWest]]\n| data4    = 189,000\n| comment4 = 11.81%\n| label5   = [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]\n| data5    = 124,000\n| comment5 = 7.71%\n| label6   = Other\n| data6    = 127,000\n| comment6 = 7.92%\n}}\n\n===Top destinations===\n<!--[[File:Westchester County Airport Destinations.gif|300px|thumb|Non-stop destinations from Westchester County Airport]]-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|+ '''Busiest Domestic Routes from HPN<br />(May 2018 \u2013 April 2019)'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\"/>\n|-\n!

In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>Feb. 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s. [[American Airlines]] also resumed mainline service.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated.

JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use the aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. This is said officially to improve service, but actually exists to pacify anti-airport residents who reside in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.  HPN also has programs that do not allow airplane larger than 12,500 pounds to takeoff at the runway intersections, or run-up their engines without prior approval of airport operations.\n\n==Local context==\nAfter several renovations, as well as discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=1989-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 | language = }}</ref> the airport is currently served by six scheduled passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations in the [[United States]].

The study noted that HPN was one of only three airports in the state that gained enplanements, performing better than the U.S. benchmark.

More directly, the terminals are accessed by NY Route 135.\n\n==IATA code==\nThe [[IATA]] code for Westchester County Airport is '''HPN'''. There is a debate in the origins of this code: many believe it is derived from the name of the city, White Plains (IATA codes normally do not begin with W because those are reserved for radio signals), while others believe the IATA code represents the first letter of the three neighboring communities, [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]], [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]], and [[North Castle, New York|North Castle]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.directorym.com/Westchester_County_Airport-a853975.html |title=Westchester County Airport's Call Letters Dispute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110204857/http://articles.directorym.com/Westchester_County_Airport-a853975.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>.

Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide [[Jet A]] and [[100LL]] fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tiedowns, [[de-icing]], [[US Customs|United States Customs]], and other aircraft services. Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

The project will expand the terminal by 20% and include additional check-in, screening and passenger waiting areas. The expansion will also include the addition of four new [[Jetbridges|jet bridges]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Cape Air]] | [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Provincetown Airport|Provincetown]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[JetBlue]] | [[Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]], [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]<ref>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181113005796/en/Start-Planning-Summer-JetBlue-Service-Nantucket-Year</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Rectrix Aviation|Rectrix Shuttle]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Tradewind Aviation]] |[[Logan International Airport|Boston]] <br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Morrisville\u2013Stowe State Airport|Stowe]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Tradewind Aviation adds Westchester County \u2013 Stowe service in W19 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/287008/tradewind-aviation-adds-westchester-county-stowe-service-in-w19/ |website=Routesonline |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]]\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Airline market share===\n{{Bar graph\n| title = '''Carrier Shares for May 2018 \u2013 April 2019'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=HPN&Airport_Name=White%20Plains,%20NY:%20Westchester%20County&carrier=FACTS |title=OST_R &#124; BTS &#124; Transtats |publisher=Transtats.bts.gov |date= |accessdate=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n| bar_width   = 45\n| width_units = em\n| label_type  = Carrier\n| data_type   = Passengers (arriving and departing)\n| data_max    = 778,000\n| label1   = [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]]\n| data1    = 778,000\n| comment1 = 48.52%\n| label2   = [[Endeavor Air|Endeavor]]\n| data2    = 193,000\n| comment2 = 12.04%\n| label3   = [[PSA Airlines|PSA]]\n| data3    = 193,000\n| comment3 = 12.01%\n| label4   = [[SkyWest Airlines|SkyWest]]\n| data4    = 189,000\n| comment4 = 11.81%\n| label5   = [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]\n| data5    = 124,000\n| comment5 = 7.71%\n| label6   = Other\n| data6    = 127,000\n| comment6 = 7.92%\n}}\n\n===Top destinations===\n<!--[[File:Westchester County Airport Destinations.gif|300px|thumb|Non-stop destinations from Westchester County Airport]]-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|+ '''Busiest Domestic Routes from HPN<br />(May 2018 \u2013 April 2019)'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\"/>\n|-\n!

Their habitat has been reduced or altered. Early research indicated a parasite called the air sac mite was responsible for the decline of the species. This is no longer considered to be a major factor. In general, Gouldian finches are susceptible to diseases and viral infections. Their beautiful colours mean that they are easily caught by predators.

Until 1977, it was trapped in greater numbers than any other finch.  From 1897, when finch trapping started in the Kimberley, it was the most sought after finch by trappers and the most desired by fanciers.  Between the years 1934 and 1939, the Gouldian finch was the most exported single finch species.  The Perth Zoo exported 22,064 finches of which 12,509 were Gouldian.  Private dealers exported 35,315 finches, of which 14,504  were Gouldian.  The number of finches taken in the 1958 finch trapping season was the largest for one year, of the 38,649 finches taken, 11,286 were Gouldian.  The last licensed trapping of Gouldian finch in Western Australia was on 15 November 1981.

Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September.

In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at {{convert|300000|ha}}.<ref name=\":5\" /> A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like [[rice]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe most widely used system is [[crop rotation]] with rice and [[vegetable]]s. This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable, such as cabbage or spinach, is planted.

Furthermore, this group grows the tallest and produces very few to no flowers.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n[[Cultivar]]s can be classified by harvest time or by the depth of rhizomes into these types:\n* Pre-mature (early) cultivars are harvested before the end of July, serotinous (late) cultivars from September on and mid-serotinous or mid-matutinal cultivars are in between these harvest times. Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September. Rhizomes of adlittoral cultivars are crisp and good for [[frying]] purposes. Deep cultivars grow more than {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} deep. They are often serotinous and can harvest high yield. Their rhizomes are [[starch]]-rich.<ref name=\":6\" />\nThe main popular ''Nelumbo nucifera'' cultivars in China are Elian 1, Elian 4, Elian 5, 9217, Xin 1 and 00\u201301. Average yield of these cultivars is 7.5\u201315 t/ha (3.3-6.7 tons/acre) of harvest in July and 30\u201345 t/ha (13-20 tons/acre) of harvest in September.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Australia, the cultivar grown for the fresh rhizome market is Quangdong and in Japan the common rhizome cultivars are Tenno and Bitchu.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==== Seed lotus ====\n[[File:Nelumbo nucifera5.jpg|200px|thumb|''Nelumbo nucifera'' seed head]]\nThe characteristics of seed lotus cultivars are a large number of [[Gynoecium|carpels]] and seed sets as well as large seeds with better nutritional properties. Roots of these varieties are thin, fibrous and do not form good rhizomes.<ref name=\":11\" /> The main popular cultivars for seed production in China are Cunsanlian, Xianglian 1, Zilian 2, Jianlian, Ganlian 62 and Taikong 36. Average yield of these cultivars in China is 1.05\u20131.9 t/ha (0.5\u20130.8 tons/acre) of dry seeds and weight of thousand seeds between {{convert|1020|to|1800|g|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\":6\" /> Green Jade and Vietnam-Red are recommended cultivars for seed production in [[Australia]].<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==== Flower lotus ====\nFlower lotus cultivars are used exclusively for [[Ornamental plant|ornamental purpose]], produce a large number of flowers and the lowest plant height.\n\n<ref name=\":6\" /> Seed production of flower lotus is poor regarding yield and quality. Flower types differ in the number of [[petal]]s (single petals, double petals or multi-petals) and their colours range from single colour in white, yellow, pink, red to bi-colour, most often of white petals with pink tip or highlights.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Farming ===\nAbout 70% of lotus for the human consumption is produced in China. In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at {{convert|300000|ha}}.<ref name=\":5\" /> A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like [[rice]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe most widely used system is [[crop rotation]] with rice and [[vegetable]]s. This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable, such as cabbage or spinach, is planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the [[harvest]] of lotus.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother alternative way is to not harvest the lotus [[rhizome]], although it is ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the [[Drainage|drained field]]. The rhizomes are then harvested next March.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nA third way is to plant lotus in ponds or fields and raise aquatic animals such as [[fish]], [[shrimp]] or [[crab]] in the same field.<ref name=\":6\" /> A more efficient use of the water for both, the [[aquatic animal]] and the lotus production, has been identified with this planting pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Assessing lotus for wastewater bioremediation|date=2009|publisher=Rural Industries Research and Development Corp|others=Seymour, Evizel., Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (Australia)|isbn=978-1741518887|location=Canberra|oclc=682913738}}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Lotus Nelumbo nucifera Water Drops 2654px.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lotus effect]] on ''nelumbo nucifera'' hybrid]]\n\n=== Human consumption ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Rhizomes ====\n[[File:Lotus root.jpg|thumb|Lotus [[rhizomes]]]]\n[[File:JaRenkonLotus11R.jpg|thumb|Boiled, sliced lotus roots used in various Asian cuisines]]\n\nThe rhizomes of lotus are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China and Japan: sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned.
