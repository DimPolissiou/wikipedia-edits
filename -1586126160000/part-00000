Around 900 CE, a [[Mississippian culture]] took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a [[Fort Ancient culture]] appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter.\n\nIn about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian era]]. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region.\n\nAs of the 16th century, the area known as Kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups\u2014Iroquoian, Sioux, Algonquian, Muskogean & Yuchi. Around the Bluestone River was the Siouan [[Tutelo]]. North of the Tennessee River was the [[Yuchi]] & south of it was the [[Cherokee]]. Much of the interior of the state was controlled by the Algonquian [[Kispoko|Cisca]]<ref>louis, franquelin, jean baptiste. \"Franquelin's map of Louisiana.\". LOC.gov. Retrieved August 17, 2017.</ref> & the confluence region of the Mississippi & Ohio was home to the [[Chickasaw]]. During a period known as the [[Beaver Wars]], 1640\u20131680, another Algonquian tribe called the Maumee, or [[Mascouten]] was chased out of southern Michigan.<ref>\"EARLY INDIAN MIGRATION IN OHIO\".

The Maumee were closely related to the Miami of Indiana. Later, the Kispoko merged with the Shawnee (who broke off from the Powhatan on the east coast) & the Thawikila of Ohio to form the larger [[Shawnee]] nation that inhabited the Ohio River Valley into the 19th century.\n\nThe Shawnee from the northwest and Cherokee from the south also sent parties into the area regularly for hunting.\n\nToday there are two state recognized tribes in Kentucky, the [[Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky]] and the [[Ridgetop Shawnee]].<ref>Metts, Tara.[https://www.scribd.com/doc/164674365/ The-Caring-Difference-Newsletter]\"National Indian Child Welfare Association (NICWA) and its implications in Kentucky\", Summer 2010, Vol. 9, No. 2, p. 4, www.scibd.com.

It leaned slightly toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since 1860, when the Whig Party dissolved. The state was not included as among the \"[[Solid South]]\" that prevailed in the former Confederacy after states disenfranchised blacks at the turn of the century. The southeastern section had aligned with the Union during the war and tended to support Republican candidates.\n\nIn a reversal of the demographics of party alignment in the post-Civil War nineteenth century, in the 21st century, state Democrats include liberal whites, African Americans, and other minorities. As of March 2020, 48.42% of the state's voters were officially registered as Democrats, 42.75% were registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], who tend to be conservative whites. Some 8.83% were registered with some other [[political party]] or as Independents.<ref name=\"kypartyreg\">{{cite web|url=https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Pages/Registration-Statistics.aspx|title=Election Statistics Registration Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=elect.ky.gov|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Despite this, a majority of the state's voters have generally elected Republican candidates for federal office since around the turn of the 21st century.\n\nFrom 1964 through 2004, Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States; however, in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] the state lost its [[bellwether]] status. Republican [[John McCain]] won Kentucky, but he lost the national popular and electoral vote to Democrat [[Barack Obama]] (McCain carried Kentucky 57% to 41%). 116 of Kentucky's 120 counties supported former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 election while he lost to Barack Obama nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/kentucky/|title=2012 Kentucky Presidential Results|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/map/#/President/2012/|title=2012 Election Results Map by State \u2013 Live Voting Updates|last=POLITICO|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nVoters in the Commonwealth supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House in the late 20th century, all from Southern states: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ([[Texas]]) in 1964, [[Jimmy Carter]] ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) in 1976, and [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Arkansas]]) in 1992 and 1996. In 21st-century presidential elections, the state has become a Republican stronghold, supporting that party's presidential candidates by double-digit margins from 2000 through 2016. At the same time, voters have continued to elect Democratic candidates to state and local offices in many jurisdictions.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! colspan = 6 | Voter registration and party enrollment as of March 2020<ref name=\"kypartyreg\" />\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Growth has been especially rapid in Laurel County, which outgrew areas such as Scott and Jessamine counties around Lexington or Shelby and Nelson Counties around Louisville. London significantly grew in population in the 2000s, from 5,692 in 2000 to 7,993 in 2010. London also landed a [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.\n\nIn northeast Kentucky, the greater [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. [[Iron and steel industry|Iron]] and [[petroleum]] production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and [[barge]], have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990; however, the population of the area has since stabilized with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]] and [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], are part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}) reside within the city limits of Ashland.\n\nThe largest county in Kentucky by area is [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike]], which contains [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]] and suburb [[Coal Run Village, Kentucky|Coal Run Village]].

Around 900 CE, a [[Mississippian culture]] took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a [[Fort Ancient culture]] appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter.\n\nIn about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian era]]. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region.\n\nAs of the 16th century, the area known as Kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups\u2014Iroquoian, Sioux, Algonquian, Muskogean & Yuchi. Around the Bluestone River was the Siouan [[Tutelo]]. North of the Tennessee River was the [[Yuchi]] & south of it was the [[Cherokee]].

London also landed a [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.\n\nIn northeast Kentucky, the greater [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. [[Iron and steel industry|Iron]] and [[petroleum]] production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and [[barge]], have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990; however, the population of the area has since stabilized with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]] and [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], are part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}) reside within the city limits of Ashland.\n\nThe largest county in Kentucky by area is [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike]], which contains [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]] and suburb [[Coal Run Village, Kentucky|Coal Run Village]]. The county and surrounding area is the most populated region in the state that is not part of a [[United States Micropolitan Statistical Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]] or a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] containing nearly 200,000 people in five counties: [[Floyd County, Kentucky|Floyd County]], [[Martin County, Kentucky|Martin County]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]], and neighboring [[Mingo County, West Virginia]]. Pike County contains slightly more than 68,000 people.\n\nOnly three U.S. states have capitals with smaller populations than Kentucky's [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] (pop. 25,527), those being [[Augusta, Maine]] (pop. 18,560), [[Pierre, South Dakota]] (pop. 13,876), and [[Montpelier, Vermont]] (pop. 8,035).\n\n==Education==\n\n{{Main| Education in Kentucky}}\n{{See also|Education Reform in Kentucky|List of colleges and universities in Kentucky|List of high schools in Kentucky|List of school districts in Kentucky}}\n[[File:William T.

Major works from the state include [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], widely seen as one of the impetuses for the American Civil War; The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1908) by [[John Fox, Jr.]], which was the first novel to sell a million copies in the United States; [[All the King's Men]] by [[Robert Penn Warren]] (1946) [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|rated as the 36th greatest novel by Modern Library]]; The Dollmaker (1954) by [[Harriette Arnow]] later adapted into a popular film starring [[Jane Fonda]]; [[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]] (1962) by [[Harry Caudill]], which led to [[The War on Poverty]], and others. [[Thomas Merton]] lived most of his life and wrote most of his books during his time as a monk at the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]] near Bardstown, Kentucky. [[Hunter S. Thompson]] is also a native of the state. In recent years, several writers from Kentucky have published widely read and critically acclaimed books. These authors include [[Wendell Berry]], [[Silas House]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]], and [[Bobbie Ann Mason]].\n\nWell-known playwrights from Kentucky include [[Marsha Norman]] ('Night Mother) and [[Naomi Wallace]] (One Flea Spare).\n[[File:Hot Brown Kurtz.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95| The [[Hot Brown]]]]\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{Main|Cuisine of Kentucky}}\n\nKentucky's cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking, although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southernfood.about.com/od/southernregionalfood/Southern_Recipes_and_Regional_Specialties.htm |title=Southern Recipes \u2013 Southern Food and Recipes |publisher=Southernfood.about.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-ye2-sem1.htm#ac303 |title=International Institute of Culinary Arts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106091226/http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-curr.htm#ac303 |archivedate=January 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One original Kentucky dish is called the [[Hot Brown]], a dish normally layered in this order: toasted bread, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with [[mornay sauce]].

They are also home to the [[Frontier League]]'s [[Florence Y'alls]] and several teams in the [[MCFL]].

It is not uncommon for fans to park in the city of [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] and use the [[Newport Southbank Bridge|Newport Southbank Pedestrian Bridge]], locally known as the \"Purple People Bridge\", to walk to these games in Cincinnati.

This is especially true of the state's three [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) programs, including the [[Kentucky Wildcats]], the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]], and the [[Louisville Cardinals]]. The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]], [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Hilltoppers]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Cardinals]] are among the most tradition-rich college men's basketball teams in the United States, combining for 11 National championships and 24 NCAA Final Fours;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} all three are high on the lists of total all-time wins, wins per season, and average wins per season.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe Kentucky Wildcats are particularly notable, leading all Division I programs in all-time wins, win percentage, NCAA tournament appearances, and being second only to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in NCAA championships.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] has also stepped onto the football scene in recent years, including winning the [[2007 Orange Bowl]] as well as the 2013 Sugar Bowl, and also producing [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2016]] [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Lamar Jackson]]. [[WKU Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky]], the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|national champion in Division I-AA football]] (now [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS)), completed its transition to Division I FBS football in 2009.\n\nThe [[Kentucky Derby]] is a horse race held annually in Louisville on the first Saturday in May. The [[Valhalla Golf Club]] in Louisville has hosted several editions of the [[PGA Championship]], [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Ryder Cup]] since the 1990s.\n\nThe [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] has a race at the [[Kentucky Speedway]] in [[Sparta, Kentucky]], which is within an hour driving distance from Cincinnati, Louisville and Lexington. The race is called the [[Quaker State 400]]. The NASCAR [[Nationwide Series]] and the [[Camping World Truck Series]] also race there, and previously the [[IndyCar Series]].\n\n[[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] in Louisville was the primary location for training and rehab for [[WWE]] professional wrestlers from 2000 until 2008, when WWE moved its contracted talent to Florida Championship Wrestling. OVW later became the primary developmental territory for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2011 to 2013.\n\nIn 2014 [[Louisville City FC]], a professional soccer team in the league then known as USL Pro and now as the [[United Soccer League]], was announced. The team made its debut in 2015, playing home games at Louisville Slugger Field. In its first season, Louisville City was the official reserve side for [[Orlando City SC]] while making its debut in [[Major League Soccer]] at the same time. That arrangement ended in 2016, when Orlando City established a [[Orlando City B|directly controlled reserve side]] in the USL.\n\n===State symbols===\n\n{{Main|List of Kentucky state

The season started on Friday, 14 March 2008 with a match between [[FC Terek Grozny|Terek]] and [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]] in [[Grozny]]. Krylia Sovetov won 3\u20130. The first goal of the season was scored by Krylia Sovetov's forward [[Yevgeny Savin]].\n\nDue to [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s participation in [[UEFA Euro 2008]], the season was interrupted from 16 May until 5 July.\n\nThe champions were determined on the 27th matchday, 2 November 2008. [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin]] claimed their first championship title in Russian Premier League, defeating [[FC Saturn Moscow Oblast (1946-2011)|Saturn]] 2\u20131 away, with [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] scoring in the 89th minute to claim the title for his club.

The season started on Friday, 14 March 2008 with a match between [[FC Terek Grozny|Terek]] and [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]] in [[Grozny]]. Krylia Sovetov won 3\u20130.

[[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin]] claimed their first championship title in Russian Premier League, defeating [[FC Saturn Moscow Oblast (1946-2011)|Saturn]] 2\u20131 away, with [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] scoring in the 89th minute to claim the title for his club. Rubin became the third (and second consecutive) non-Moscow club to become Russian champions.\n\nThe last round of matches was played on 22 November 2008.\n\n==Teams==\n14 clubs placed 1\u201314 in [[Russian Premier League 2007]] and 2 top clubs from 2007 season of [[Russian First Division]] took part in the league:\n{{Location map+  |Russia |width=1000 |float=center|caption=Location of teams in '''Russian Premier League 2008'''|places=\n{{Location map~ |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=43.316667 |long=45.683333 |label=[[FC Terek Grozny|Terek]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=55.783333 |long=49.166667 |label=[[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=57.626074 |long=39.884471 |label=[[FC Shinnik Yaroslavl|Shinnik]]|position=right }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=55.752222 |long=37.598889 |label=Moscow Metro Area |position=left}}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=43.483333 |long=43.616667 |label=[[PFC Spartak Nalchik|Spartak&nbsp;N.]] |position=left }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=58        |long=56.316667 |label=[[FC Amkar Perm|Amkar]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=43.133333|long=131.900000      |label=[[FC Luch-Energiya Vladivostok|Luch-Energiya]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=53.233333 |long=50.166667 |label=[[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia&nbsp;Sovetov]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=59.933333 |long=30.333333 |label=[[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark size=4x4px |lat=56.5      |long=84.966667 |label=[[FC Tom Tomsk|Tom]] }}\n{{Location map~  |Russia |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |mark size=1x1px |lat=79.7 |long=50.7 |label='''Moscow Metro Area teams:'''<br>[[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]]<br>[[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo]]<br>[[FC Khimki]]<br>[[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]]<br>[[FC Moscow]]<br>[[FC Saturn Moscow Oblast (1946-2011)|Saturn]]<br>[[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]]}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Team\n!Place\n!Head Coach\n!Team Captain\n!Venue\n!Capacity\n!Avg.

After he was dismissed from the group in 1962, he started his own band, the Pete Best Four, and later joined many other bands over the years. He is one of several people who have been referred to as the [[Fifth Beatle]].\n\nBest was born in the city of [[Chennai|Madras]], then part of [[British Raj|British India]]. After Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] (1924\u20131988), moved to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, she opened [[the Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool. The Beatles (at the time known as [[the Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts at the club.\n\nThe Beatles invited Best to join on 12 August 1960, on the eve of the group's first [[Hamburg]] season of club dates. [[Ringo Starr]] eventually replaced Best on 16 August 1962, when the group's manager, [[Brian Epstein]], fired Best at the request of [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] following the band's first recording session at [[EMI Studios|Abbey Road Studios]] in London. Over 30 years later, Best received a major monetary payout for his work with the Beatles after the release of their 1995 compilation of their early recordings on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', with Best on drums on a number of the album's tracks.\n\nAfter working in a number of commercially unsuccessful groups, Best gave up the music industry to work as a civil servant for 20 years, before starting the Pete Best Band. He has been married for over 50 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n== Early life ==\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's mother, [[Mona Best]] (born Alice Mona Shaw), was born in Delhi, India, and was the daughter of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw.{{sfn|Goldsmith|2004|p=35}} Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, was born in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), [[Madras Presidency]], British India, on 24 November 1941.

Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he \"wasn't sure\" about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and \"was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities \u2026 I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was\".{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ [[Bob Wooler]], who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice, to which Wooler replied that it was not a good idea, as Best was very popular with the fans.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=329}} Part of the dilemma for Epstein that arose at that time, (when the band had not yet achieved national success, but rather local status as a good band with limited income), was that Best was an asset at gigs, particularly with the girl fans, and who put on a good show, ensuring venues would have a solid audience. The counter-argument, however, was the larger consideration of the band's having the best music producible for record sales. John, Paul and George ultimately decided that record production was more important than having a drummer for live stage performances who was more image than substance. In the meantime, Epstein withheld telling Best that EMI had made a recording contract with the band (verbally since June & in writing at the end of July 1962), which meant that a new drummer was now inevitable. There may have been legal issues had Pete known.{{sfn|Shout \u2013 Philip Norman|1981|p=149-150}}\n\nEpstein ultimately decided that \"If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go.\"{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday, 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session.

Burlington VT, Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010</ref> Mona had done a great deal for the band by arranging a number of important early gigs and lending them a badly needed helping hand when they returned from Hamburg the first time, but this came at the cost of having to contend with her overbearing nature. At this crucial time in the history of the Beatles, John Lennon confided to Flannery that he considered Mona \"bossy like [his aunt] Mimi\" and believed that she was using the Beatles only for the sake of her son,<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\">Brocken 2010</ref> though this should be weighed against the fact that the Beatles' cordial relations with Mona soon resumed. She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' album cover.<ref>Roag Best et al. ''The Beatles: The True Beginnings''. p170</ref>\n\nAlthough Brian Epstein's publicly stated reluctance to fire Best quickly became a matter of record in the early biographies,{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=138}} he had found Mona Best to be the cause of mounting aggravation. Epstein's distaste for her interference in the Beatles' management, including her \"aggressive opinions about his handling of her son's career\", was obvious to everyone,<ref>Carlin, Peter Ames, ''Paul: A Life''. Touchstone Books, New York 2009 p73</ref> and he also reportedly considered Mona Best a loose cannon who must not be allowed to interfere in his operations.<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\" /> Moreover, the very recent birth of Roag further complicated matters.

worldwide fame. After he was dismissed from the group in 1962, he started his own band, the Pete Best Four, and later joined many other bands over the years. He is one of several people who have been referred to as the [[Fifth Beatle]].\n\nBest was born in the city of [[Chennai|Madras]], then part of [[British Raj|British India]]. After Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] (1924\u20131988), moved to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, she opened [[the Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool. The Beatles (at the time known as [[the Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts at the club.\n\nThe Beatles invited Best to join on 12 August 1960, on the eve of the group's first [[Hamburg]] season of club dates. [[Ringo Starr]] eventually replaced Best on 16 August 1962, when the group's manager, [[Brian Epstein]], fired Best at the request of [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] following the band's first recording session at [[EMI Studios|Abbey Road Studios]] in London. Over 30 years later, Best received a major monetary payout for his work with the Beatles after the release of their 1995 compilation of their early recordings on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', with Best on drums on a number of the album's tracks.\n\nAfter working in a number of commercially unsuccessful groups, Best gave up the music industry to work as a civil servant for 20 years, before starting the Pete Best Band. He has been married for over 50 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n== Early life ==\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's mother, [[Mona Best]] (born Alice Mona Shaw), was born in Delhi, India, and was the daughter of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw.{{sfn|Goldsmith|2004|p=35}} Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, was born in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), [[Madras Presidency]], British India, on 24 November 1941.

EMI engineer Norman Smith stated in a 2006 video interview that \"it was mainly down to what he was playing and not how he was playing,\" when \"Love Me Do\" was first recorded, referring to the head [[Arrangement#Jazz|arrangement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLAK8o0RXtA</ref> Smith's view is supported by the fact in all the recorded music Best played as drummer in 1961 and 1962 (including the Decca test audition and the My Bonnie 45) his drumming is quite acceptable.{{according to who|date=January 2020}} Martin however found Best's timing inadequate and wanted to replace Best with an experienced studio [[Session musician|session drummer]] for the recordings, a common practice at the time.{{sfn|Martin|1994|pp=120\u2013123}} \nMartin stated years later:\n{{quote|I decided that the drums, which are really the backbone of a good rock group, didn't give the boys enough support.

Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he \"wasn't sure\" about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and \"was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities \u2026 I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was\".{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ [[Bob Wooler]], who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice, to which Wooler replied that it was not a good idea, as Best was very popular with the fans.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=329}} Part of the dilemma for Epstein that arose at that time, (when the band had not yet achieved national success, but rather local status as a good band with limited income), was that Best was an asset at gigs, particularly with the girl fans, and who put on a good show, ensuring venues would have a solid audience. The counter-argument, however, was the larger consideration of the band's having the best music producible for record sales. John, Paul and George ultimately decided that record production was more important than having a drummer for live stage performances who was more image than substance. In the meantime, Epstein withheld telling Best that EMI had made a recording contract with the band (verbally since June & in writing at the end of July 1962), which meant that a new drummer was now inevitable. There may have been legal issues had Pete known.{{sfn|Shout \u2013 Philip Norman|1981|p=149-150}}\n\nEpstein ultimately decided that \"If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go.\"{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday, 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session.

Burlington VT, Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010</ref> Mona had done a great deal for the band by arranging a number of important early gigs and lending them a badly needed helping hand when they returned from Hamburg the first time, but this came at the cost of having to contend with her overbearing nature. At this crucial time in the history of the Beatles, John Lennon confided to Flannery that he considered Mona \"bossy like [his aunt] Mimi\" and believed that she was using the Beatles only for the sake of her son,<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\">Brocken 2010</ref> though this should be weighed against the fact that the Beatles' cordial relations with Mona soon resumed. She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' album cover.<ref>Roag Best et al. ''The Beatles: The True Beginnings''. p170</ref>\n\nAlthough Brian Epstein's publicly stated reluctance to fire Best quickly became a matter of record in the early biographies,{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=138}} he had found Mona Best to be the cause of mounting aggravation. Epstein's distaste for her interference in the Beatles' management, including her \"aggressive opinions about his handling of her son's career\", was obvious to everyone,<ref>Carlin, Peter Ames, ''Paul: A Life''. Touchstone Books, New York 2009 p73</ref> and he also reportedly considered Mona Best a loose cannon who must not be allowed to interfere in his operations.<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\" /> Moreover, the very recent birth of Roag further complicated matters. Although Best himself was not personally responsible for this development, it would still have caused a grave scandal had it become generally known, and Epstein may have been horrified at the prospect.<ref>Inglis, Ian, ''The Beatles In Hamburg'', Reaktion Press, London 2009 p142 et seq.</ref>\n\n=== Popularity ===\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's popularity with fans was a source of friction, as many female fans considered him to be the band's best-looking member.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} Radio Merseyside presenter [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous.{{sfn|Leigh|1998}} In the 31 August 1961 issue of [[Bill Harry]]'s ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music publication in Liverpool, [[Bob Wooler]] reported on the Beatles' local musical impact and singled out Best for special praise, calling the group \"musically authoritative and physically magnetic, example the mean, moody magnificence of drummer Pete Best \u2013 a sort of teenage [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/petebest2.shtml |title=Pete Best \u2013 Bill Harry \u2013 Mersey Beat |publisher=Triumphpc.com |accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> During the ''Teenagers' Turn'' showcase in [[Manchester]], Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} Afterwards, attentive females surrounded Best at the stage door, while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs.

Feeling let down and depressed, he sat at home for two weeks, not wanting to face anybody or answer the inevitable questions about why he had been sacked.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein secretly arranged with his booking agent partner, Joe Flannery, for Best to join [[Lee Curtis and the All-Stars]],{{sfn|Brocken|2010|p=102}} which then broke off from Curtis to become Pete Best & the All Stars.
