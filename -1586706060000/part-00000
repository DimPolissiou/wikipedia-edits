At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet .

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]], was won 1\u20130 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence.

As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the [[1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification]].\n\nThe final set of qualifying games for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] took place against [[Haiti]].

First of all, their reduced squad meant that they omitted Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez.

Once they arrived, there was more trouble. [[Adidas]] sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake.

The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek.

El Salvador topped their group with wins over Belize (2\u20131), Nicaragua (2\u20131), and a draw with Guatemala (0\u20130). In the semifinals El Salvador lost to the eventual champions Costa Rica 0\u20131. In the third place playoff they lost 0\u20131 to Guatemala but nonetheless qualified for the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (as now 5 Central American teams qualified for the Gold Cup).

''La Selecta'' defeated Nicaragua 2\u20130, Belize 5\u20132, and lost 2\u20130 against Panama, which was enough to let them advance from the group in second place.

In 1941, the first international competition in [[CONCACAF]], the international governing body for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, the [[CCCF Championship|Central American and Caribbean Championship (CCCF)]] took place in Costa Rica. El Salvador took part for the first time alongside Costa Rica, [[Cura\u00e7ao national football team|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], and Panama. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.<ref name=\"CCCF 1941\"/>\n\nThe [[1943 CCCF Championship]] took place in San Salvador with the participation of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. El Salvador was coached by former national player [[Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer)|Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez]]. At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.<ref name=\"CCCF 1943\"/> El Salvador defended their title in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants. ''La Selecta'' finished in third place, winning three matches and losing two.

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

El Salvador was placed in the four team group [[Honduras]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Nicaragua]], which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the [[CONCACAF Championship]].\n\n[[1963 CONCACAF Championship|The first CONCACAF Championship was hosted in 1963]] and El Salvador hosted both the qualification round and final tournament.

El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras.

According to [[Luis Guevara Mora]], the 20-year-old goalkeeper, the [[Salvadoran Football Federation]] decided to take members of the Federation, as well as their friends and family, and spent so much money they could not afford to bring a full squad.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The team took many stops throughout Europe under the direction of the Federation, taking three days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek. When Guevara Mora called to him to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him, and the ball went past Jovel in front of the net.{{cn|date=April 2020}} After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation.

Fallen into the same group as [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] and [[Guyana national football team|Guyana]], El Salvador heroically snatched a draw in [[San Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica)]] (after being 2\u20130 down to score) on 8 Jun 2012. Four days later, a home defeat against Mexico (1\u20132) precipitated the departure of [[Rub\u00e9n Israel]] whose poor relations with [[Jaime Rodr\u00edguez]], president of the National Institute of Sport Salvador (INDES) were known all.\n[[Salvadoran Football Association]] (FESFUT) under pressure following the surprise resignation of [[Rub\u00e9n Israel]], named the Mexican [[Juan de Dios Castillo]] at the head of the selection July 14, 2012.\nDespite a good start (1\u20130 in a friendly match against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] after 10 years of failure against this opponent), a draw conceded at [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] qualification (CONCACAF), facing a modest [[Guyana national football team|Guyana]] national football team (2\u20132) earned him the wrath of the public. A victory in extremis (2\u20133) at [[Georgetown, Guyana]] (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper [[Dagoberto Portillo]] in additional time) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0\u20131) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team. [[Juan de Dios Castillo]] was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian [[Agust\u00edn Castillo]], five national champion with [[C.D. FAS]].\n\nAgainst all odds, El Salvador finished 3rd in the [[2013 Copa Centroamericana]] mean qualification for the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] in the US in July when El Salvador shares the same group as [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti.\n\n===Match fixing===\nThe national team had accusations of several players purposely losing matches on purpose in exchange for monetary rewards. Some of these allegations involved games against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. After an investigation, 14 players were handed immediate lifetime bans from football on September 20, 2013. Those players were [[Luis Anaya]], [[Osael Romero]], [[Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez]], [[Christian Castillo (footballer)|Christian Castillo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Granadino|Miguel Granadino]], [[Miguel Montes]], [[Dagoberto Portillo]], [[Dennis Alas]], [[Darwin Bonilla]], [[Ram\u00f3n Flores (footballer)|Ram\u00f3n Flores]], [[Alfredo Pacheco]], [[Jos\u00e9 Henr\u00edquez|Jos\u00e9 Mardoqueo Henr\u00edquez]], [[Marvin Gonz\u00e1lez]], and [[Reynaldo Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez|Reynaldo Hern\u00e1ndez]]. [[Carlos Monteagudo]] received a ban of 18 months. [[Eliseo Quintanilla]] and [[V\u00edctor Turcios]] received 6 month bans. [[Alexander Escobar]], [[Christian S\u00e1nchez (Salvadoran footballer)|Christian S\u00e1nchez]], and U-20 goalkeeper Yimmy Cuellar received a ban of 30 days. Other players were forced to go through the investigation for 20 more days. After the 20-day investigation, Rodrigo Mart\u00ednez was sentenced to a ban of 5 years, [[Rodolfo Zelaya]] to a ban of one year, and [[Benji Villalobos]] to a ban of 6 months.\n\nOn 6 September 2016, the team revealed that they had all been approached, and had turned down, an offer to ensure that their result against [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] saw [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] progress to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|next round]],<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup 2018 qualifying: El Salvador 'refuse bribe to fix match'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37284033|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 September 2016|date=6 September 2016}}</ref> but then-coach [[Ramon Maradiaga]] was later fined 20,000 Swiss francs and banned from football for two years for not disclosing the approach.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifa bans former El Salvador coach for two years for involvement in match-fixing case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43981077|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 October 2018|date=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Competitive record==\n===FIFA World Cup===\n{{main|El Salvador at the FIFA World Cup}}\nEl Salvador has never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition.
