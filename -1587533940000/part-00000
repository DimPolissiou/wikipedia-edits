In this study, it was found that, in all three facets of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior), the percentage of individuals who recognized themselves as non-heterosexual was larger when the survey method in use was the [[randomized response|item randomized response]], known to reduce socially desirable responding, in lieu of questions with direct responses. However, because the study was based on online volunteer samples and was therefore not nationally representative, researchers make no suggestion as to the real size of the LGBT population.<ref name=\"nber.org\">{{cite journal |title=The Size of the LGBT Population and the Magnitude of Anti-Gay Sentiment are Substantially Underestimated |journal=Management Science |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=3168\u20133186 |year=2013 |first1=Katherine B. |last1=Coffman |first2=Lucas C. |last2=Coffman |first3=Keith M.

First, using [[Facebook]] data and [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] [[Opinion poll|poll]] results, he correlated the percentage of men who are openly gay with their state of birth and residence. Second, he measured what percentage of Google pornographic searches were for gay porn. The first method gave between 1 and 3 percent. The second showed that roughly 5 percent of men search for gay porn in every state.
